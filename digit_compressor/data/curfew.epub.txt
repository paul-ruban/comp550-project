He slowly reaches for her lips as the squirt of cool seawater hits his cheekbone. He pulls back with a sour frown, "Hey!" He turns and frowns down at his assailant, wiping off the ocean water from his wet face and forehead blonde colored bangs, jabbing a finger with a smile at the dolphin, "Swiggles." The dolphin lounges its long nose on top of the short seawall and chuckles with a dolphin laugh at the male as its body wiggles side to side inside the warm Gulf of Mexico waters.

Her lips form a frown and then turn upwards into a smile with a soft giggle and as her petite body wiggles between his muscular chest and two taunt biceps. "That's not my name, Preston." The female is a demon displaying a heart shaped face, a button nose, and a pair of rose tinted lips, scooting backward from his body, sitting on the edge of a red colored towel that covers a yellow colored beach lounge chair which holds a second taller demon. The demon female possesses a head of long brown hair with golden highlights, a tone of pale tinted skin, and a pair of turquoise eyes, measuring five feet and two inches in height with a pair of short legs and a long waistline. She wears a set of pink and white colored fashion military-style fatigues which decorates her long walking shorts, a solid pink tee shirt, and a pair of pink tinted sneakers.

Preston continues to jab a finger down at the dolphin with a smile. The dolphin slips back down into the water and then spins around from the sea wall and the two demons, swiftly swimming ahead, leaping up from the water and jumps through the air. The sea mammal performs two dolphin somersaults above the water for fun and then lands back down in the sea with a loud splash.

"That's her name." Preston laughs and as his finger continues to follow the single playfully dolphin. The dolphin swims further into deep blue sea and joins her pod of family. He measures at six feet and five inches in height with a mesomorph body type and possesses wavy blonde colored hair, a set of board shoulders, a rectangle face structure with a squared jaw line, a pair of dark green colored eyeball against his olive tinted skin tone.

"The dolphin is a female. How do you know that, Preston? Each one looks alike to me." She turns and frowns at the sea mammal that continues to swim on top of the water.

He smiles and watches the dolphin. "Of course, what else would she be?"

"You know there are a set of male dolphins in the ocean to occupy each female one." She returns and frowns into his smile.

"Yeah, I know that too. But I don't want any sea or sky or land male around my lambie pie, ever," he returns with a wink and leans down, kissing her frown. Her frown turns upright into a smile, kissing his warm lips.

A loud whistle sounds beside their nose profiles which violently perturbs their tender love moment. They surface from the tender kiss and then both turn to see the loud commotion.

Before a long vanilla colored concrete sea wall, a row of orange colored lounge chairs faces the southern seas underneath a floor of golden sand grains, where any person can sit and watch the ocean and her sea creatures while burning their body in the sizzling sunrays. Several feet behind the row of chairs, a long row of wooden picnic tables stand in a straighter line, where any person or couple or family can enjoy a heated day with trays of refreshing food items. However, today, each picnic table is void of people and empty of food items, except for the center picnic table which contains a male that jumps up and down on top of the wooden planks like a big, silly bird. The male measures six feet and three inches in height with a slender ectomorph body frame, displaying a tone of pale skin, shoulder length golden blonde hair and is named Morton. He stops jumping on top of the table and points at the school building with a nod in silence.

"Class time." Preston returns and nods to his demon girlfriend, leaning down, kissing her mouth. He pulls back and slides off the lounge chair first, leaning down, assisting her to stand on top of the golden sands. He grabs her waistline and then lifts her petite body into air for fun with a smile as she giggles. Then he gently drops her feet down on top of the golden sand grains and leans down, tenderly kissing her lips again this morning, pulling back with a smile. "Then, it's time for us." He stands upright and spins around with his girlfriend, slowly moving them ahead toward the single story building, holding her hand.

She frowns at the squat white colored building. The color of white paint is splashed over each building structure as white hue reflects the attack from numerous heated sunrays off the building material and back into the atmosphere while sorta cooling down the structure. She turns and smiles up at his jaw line, "We can escape much like Romano and Juliet in the play..."

He continues to move ahead and wears a stern face staring at the building. "We're not players here. This isn't a play. We have to obey curfew, Priam." She looks down with a sad face and stares at her moving feet.

He stops with a stern face and spins around to face Priam, hugging her into his chest with a deep sigh. He leans down and places his skull sideways on top of her soft, dark colored hair roots, smelling her lavender smell, whispering softly. "I'm sorry, lamb." Then he lifts up his bone skull and reaches up with a free hand, tugging her golden ribbon out of place from her hair strands for fun while chuckling with his mischief.

She pulls back from his hug with a smile. "Okay, Preston." Priam reaches up and grabs the loose ribbon adjusting it back around her two earlobes, dropping her hands back down into his chest with a nod. "But I have a new plan, a really great full proof plan, Preston. That can be used for both of us."

He cuddles Priam and spins around to face the building, slowly advancing them ahead while softly whining with a sour frown. "Do you really possess another new plan, lambie pie?"

Priam, her mind is clicking too much with one of her newest idea from escaping curfew, which is impossible for both the group of angels and demons that reside at the NAS Key West facility.

She turns and smiles up at his jaw line. "This is the best, the brightest idea that I've ever conceived and it's going to work. It'll work perfectly for both us, Preston."

He stops with a huff and spins around to face Priam, hugging her into his chest with a smile as she struggles to get free but can't. He pulls back with a smile and continues to hold both of her arms, leaning down into her face. "We'll discuss it later, lambie pie."

"Later is too late. Let's ditch class right now." She smiles.

He stands upright and cuddles Priam, moving them ahead towards the squat building,

Morton dashes ahead and passes the love couple with a smile.

The H-shaped, white colored structure on the NSA Key West military base is called the H-Building, since the U.S. Navy department isn't very creative with any type of governmental official name for a military road or personnel housing. The H Building also houses a group of angels on left side of the structure compartments and a set of demons on the right-side compartments, who both live peacefully together for thousands of centuries.

The two-way common wooden hallway between the H-wings boasts a dining room, a grocery store, a clothes shop, a book and music store and numerous academic classrooms based on the different celestial range of ages shared by both single Angels and Demons for learning, specifically about Curfew.

Each single and unmarried angel or demon is required to attend the academic school thus keeping active and mischievous supernatural beings out of trouble until each one is married. Each married couple births and then care for their children while teaching a set of life lessons to each youngster and keeping their den house clean and dry inside the rented H-Building structure.

A single young supernatural being possesses too much free time, since independent comes at the age of sixteen angel years and provides three options: leave the den or get married and stay at the den or stay and attend school inside the den.

On top of golden colored sand grains, Preston continues to move ahead with a stern face and passes the row of stationary natural wooden picnic tables, holding her hand. "It's too late to implement your new idea, lamb. We're almost there at the school building."

His friend Morton lounges on top of a sitting wooden bench at the first picnic table, where each table is used for the breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner meal for each angel and demon. He slides off from the bench and stands upright, brushing off the sand grains with a sour frown. Preston and Priam slowly strut ahead and pass Morton.

Morton swiftly moves ahead and struts beside Preston, wearing a pair of red, white, and blue colored, fashionable military-style, fatigue-patterned trousers, a pair of blue sandals, and a solid colored red short sleeved shirt underneath a red, white and blue colored fashionable military-style fatigue-pattern long jacket. He turns and scans the sands, the building, the pale blue sky, the white clouds, and pods of palm trees with a smile. "I like this place, Preston."

"That's great, Morton." Preston continues to strut ahead and holds the hand on Priam, staring with a stern face at the single building.

Morton nods. "The mainland of Key West didn't exist until about the year 11,000 B.C."

"Okay, Morton." Preston huffs with annoyance at his fellow demon as Priam smiles.

Morton quickly starts his dull, tenor sounding monotone on Earth's history while performing the same morning ritual to education or aggregate his demon buddy Preston. Priam hasn't figured out if Morton's true motive for the lecture, but Preston hates it passionately.

"Yeah, it was kinda around the time that the Island of Atlantis sank down into the Atlantic Ocean after that nasty sea quake." Morton continues to lecture with a smile.

"Okay, Morton." Preston puffs with more annoyance as Priam giggles.

Morton moves beside Preston and waves both arms in the air for drama. "These Keys, not a set of car keys for driving a vehicle to and from a physical place which is kinda like a pair of demon or angel wings that are used fly in the sky and soar over the landscape. Well, I mean, the scattered ocean islands Keys, the islands are really the leftover remnants from that broken up great big island of Atlantis."

"It sank." Preston frowns.

He continues to move with Preston and waves both arms in the air with a stern face. "No. No. No. The island of Atlantis was destroyed by an ugly seaquake in the year 9,000 BC and ended up in numerous parts and pieces that continued to float on top of the ocean waters like a set of tan colored big and small white colored ice bergs, not cold, but warm. Then, the tan colored warm bergs floated up and down over the sea waters and finally settled inside the Gulf Stream and then each one attached together and formed a large land mass. At the time, the North American continuant was only foamy water, hot plumes of stream, and hot lava. The Atlantis body parts, do you get it? The body of water, not the biological body parts created the tiny isles as a rounded body that goes around the water," he laughs. "Do you get it, Preston?"

"Okay, Morton." Preston huffs with annoyance as Priam giggles.

"Then, the other little rock remnants followed the big land mass and then sank down, drowning into the Atlantic Ocean, living down on the ocean floor. So, in the 9,000 BC, this isle or is it atoll...?"

"Okay, Morton." Preston puffs.

"I told all. Do you get it? Atoll. I believe this atoll is a nice spot on the Planet Earth. We should've moved here eons ago." Morton moves with Preston toward the building mixing with the other life forms that also advance toward a same set of open double doors.

An unfamiliar voice on an unfamiliar body pulls up and moves beside Morton, turning with a smile to see the pale nose profile on Morton, "Eons, who in the world uses that ancient Earth term anymore?"

Morton turns and frowns down at the black colored hair roots on the stranger. "And who are you, little man?" The stranger measures, in height, thirteen inches shorter than tall and slender Morton.

"Palmer Ling." The human male slaps his chest and stares at Morton. Palmer displays a head of dark brown colored hair, a pair of slanted brown colored eyes, standing five feet and two inches in height of lean muscle. He wears a light green, cream, and khaki fashionable military-style fatigue-patterned trousers that are tucked down into a pair of polished black tinted hiking boots, a matching fashionable, military-style, fatigue-patterned jacket over a white colored tee shirt. He possesses a pair of frameless eyeglasses, a round-shaped face, yellow tinted skin tone, a pair of pink lips, and a set of rosy cheeks from the warm air and hot sunshine that reflects off the golden sands of Key West.

"Ling-a-ding." Blaze shouts out loud and pulls up beside Morton, shoving petite Palmer to the side, turning to sneer down on the dark brown hair roots on the short kid. Blaze wears silver, gray, and black colored fashionable, military-style, fatigue-patterned pair of long walking shorts, a matching sleeve less vest over a solid black colored tee shirt. He stands six feet and two inches in height with a set of board shoulders and hard muscles, a set of narrow hips, a diamond-shaped face, a tone of mocha colored skin tone, a head of short dark brown curly hair, and a pair of brown eyes with golden specks on each iris.

"What did you say to me, homie?" Palmer turns and smiles at Blaze.

Morton leans over and reaches out, slapping on Palmer's collar bone a demon warning, not to upset tall and mean demon Blaze. He stands upright with a smile and a soft chuckle. Demon Blaze is going to beat up petite Palmer when the school instructors are not waiting. The human race will never learn the ways of the supernatural beings.

Blaze turns and smiles at Morton. "He's a ding-a-ling, like you, Morton." He returns back and sneers down at the dark brown hair roots on Palmer, "So, that makes you ding-a-ling number two, tot."

Palmer looks up and narrows his eyebrows with a frown at Blaze, "Tot?"

"Do not inquire comes my personal advice at the moment." Morton continues to stroll in the line between Blaze and Preston. Priam continues to move with her demon boyfriend Preston.

Preston continues to stare at the building and says with an authority tone. "Chill, Blaze!"

A teenager female measures five feet and five inches in height and stands upright from the swing seat at the playground equipment for the children, wearing a smile. She moves ahead, pulling next to Palmer. She wears a pair of tan, pale green, and crème colored, fashionable military-style, fatigue-patterned walking shorts and a short matching jacket with a tan colored tee shirt, and a pair of brown hiking boots, displaying a head of short brightly colored red curly hair, an oval beige face with a pair of blue-gray eyes. She leans over and stares at the new set of students. "Who are all of you here?" Her unfamiliar face trills in alto clarinet.

Morton smiles. "We are all delinquents from another place and time..."

"...and space..." Radium closely hugs against Morton's body with a smile and measures five feet and eight inches in height with an endomorph body frame, a pair of short legs, a set of muscular shoulders, a tone of bronze tinted skin, a square jaw line and a buzz cut of exposed honey blonde roots with a pair of intense hazel-green eyes. His eyeballs shift from Morton to Palmer curiously. Radium wears a pair of brown, green, and crème colored, fashionable military-style, fatigue-patterned trousers with a solid brown tee shirt, a pair of brown hiking boots without a jacket.

"My walking space...." Palmer reaches over and punches Radium's bicep with a silly laugh. Radium reaches down and grabs Palmer's forearm, twisting it sideways in fury with a sneer.

"Not here, tots!" Blaze continues to move with a sour frown and stares at the building.

"Our space." Morton smiles and leans over, yanking Radium's hand from Palmer's forearm while exposing a demon red imprint on the human arm. Morton swiftly applies one of his demon healing touches to the human's arm, before Palmer's eyeballs views the harmless but red tinted demon wound while causing another physical fight between an angel and a demon over some stinky human and the human's safety.

Palmer jerks back his arm and examines the naked forearm, feeling the warmth with curiosity. "O! You're a pair of cyber buddies. I got it. You're a pair of local homies." He looks up and laughs with silliness at the nose profile on Morton.

"Something like that!" Radium turns and winks at his demon boyfriend Morton. Morton winks back with a smile and playfully bumps into Radium.

The unknown teen female at the end of the line beside Palmer continues to move with the gang of new students and scan the sandy grounds, "So how is it that you know each other here in person?" She ponders the mystery behind the gang of new kids at military base school, who had arrived three weeks ago.

"We're all kin." Blaze laughs with a wicked grin and points to his buddy Radium first and then down the line of real demons. "We are family. This is my cousin, my aunt, my sis, my bro..."

"My guy." Morton leans over and hugs the arm on Radium with a giggle of happiness.

"My guy." Radium turns and touches Morton's cheekbone with a smile as Morton closes his eyelids and softly moans.

"Tots, not here." Blaze turns and frowns at Morton and then Radium.

Morton opens his eyelids and clicks his tongue at Radium, "Right!" Blaze shakes his bone skull and chuckles at silly Morton.

At the end the line, the unknown teen female returns back and studies each new student. "Are each one of you related by marriage then?"

"Sorta! Do you know the term, family tree?" Blaze smiles.

Palmer nods. "Of course, every family clan clings on a long branch of a family tree."

Blaze turns and fingers Morton first with a smile, moving to the next person down the line. "He's my cousin. She's my second cousin. He's my twelfth cousin," he laughs with the other supernatural beings.

"Twelfth cousin, I didn't know there was a twelfth cousin." Palmer turns and frowns at Morton and then Radium. The two males do not favor each other in biological terms. Morton possesses a tone of pale skin and a head of blonde hair while Blaze displays a tone of dark skin and a head of brown colored hair.

"A twelfth cousin is eleven times removed." Blaze laughs.

Palmer frowns. "Eleven times removed that doesn't exist when identifying a set of blood relatives. You are lying to me." He jabs a finger at Blaze as Blaze sneers evilly.

Morton claps for attention and smiles. "This silly game is gone. Pick another activity, children! Where we all can enjoy? So, name something, kiddies!"

"Eat." Radium rubs his growling stomach with a smile and stares at the H Building.

Morton smiles with a nod. "Break my fast."

"Just say, breakfast." A new female appears and rolls her eyeballs, saying out loud before an angle and a demon start another physical fight which could be easily eye witnessed by one of the two humans within the moving line. Her name is Barbie.

Barbie squeezes between Palmer and Blaze and marches with the group, grabbing Blaze's hand with a smile, staring at the H Building also. She measures five feet and ten inches in height and displays a head of long waist-length black colored hair, a tone of black colored skin tint and a pair of amber colored eyes, wearing a pair of candy pink, mint green, and white colored, fashionable military-style, fatigue-patterned walking shorts with a mint green solid tee shirt and a pair of mint green sneakers without a jacket.

Morton nods. "Break your fast is a very old and elegant expression that had been used in the country of England for eating...."

"Break your nose!" Blaze turns and sneers at the nose profile on Radium.

Morton touches his nose with a worried brow. "Break my nose?" Morton turns and frowns at Radium.

Blaze nods with a laugh. "That's a modern day violent expression used here in America for beating on body parts."

Palmer shudders with fear from the gang of new students and points at the building. "Let's go and check out the new dining room inside the H Building first! It was recently renovated, last year, with new food slots for healthier nutritional selections," he quickly dashes ahead with a worried brow, leaving the row of new students behind.

The row of demons and angels stomp off the sandy grounds and move over the vanilla sideway.

Morton continues to strut with his friends and laughs out loud. "Is the new dining room bigger than heaven?"

"Okay, Morton." Preston huffs with annoyance.

Morton chuckles. "Or is the new dining room bigger than hell, then?"

"Okay, Morton." Preston turns and sneers at Morton.

Morton turns and waves at Preston with a giggle of fun as Preston sees the movement but ignores the silly demon.

The entrance door into the building is open and double wide with numerous students entering for class.

The line of demons and angels spit into pairs and enter the main building, moving down a common hallway with a wooden floor and vanilla painted smooth walls, heading towards the dining room for the breakfast meal, before a day of school classes.

Radium and Morton lead the gang which is followed by Barbie and Blaze, then Preston and Priam. The unfamiliar teen female walks last and alone, entering through the archway, following the gang of new students. Each student quickly stands in a line and then collects a food tray of steaming food items, exiting the kitchen grill, forming a new row and stares into the new dining room area.

Morton stands beside Radium and scans the new dining room with a smile. "Well, there are so many types of social entanglements," he refers when the angels and demons, nicely or naughty, mix with the rows of humans, who eat a nutritious breakfast food tray also inside the same room.

The unfamiliar teen female stands at the end of the line and scans the new dining room also. The new group of students are social, only with their own kind, and not friendly to the other school mates here at the military school, so she has been assigned to spy on the new group of kids while collecting and gathering useful data about any potential trouble maker here at the military base.

She points to the first table which is filled with other students near the side wall with a smile. "Well, I can share this information. The northern wall is reserved for the nerds. The southern wall houses the dorks. The eastern wall is lined with each egghead here at the school. The western wall holds all the jocks. The northwestern section of the wall is composed of the instrument-loving musicians. And the southeastern section of the wall represents the techies or the computer geeks..."

"What are we?" Morton turns and smiles at Radium.

"Not them!" Radium scans the room with a smile.

"With them?" Barbie laughs.

"By them?" Priam smiles.

"For them?" Preston nods.

"Or under them!" Blaze chuckles.

Barbie giggles at silly conversation and views each empty table holding her food tray. "Where do we sit, Blaze?"

"How about over all of them?" Radium laughs as Morton giggles.

"We can sit at the empty table in the middle of the floor." Preston nods to the table.

"Do we sit in a longitude or latitude position?" Blaze laughs.

"The students and the teachers are located in a longitude pose eating and chatting." Barbie remarks.

"Latitude sitting, here we come." Blaze smiles and moves ahead to the empty table. Each angel and demon slowly paces ahead with a food tray towards the latitude position on the empty table near the row of glass window as Palmer and Dolly follows behind with a smile. Each one sits down.

Palmer sits last and pulls his metal chair closer to the table edge while brushing his hand against Priam's leg, saying with a smile. "Sorry! I'm..."

"... with her. Watch your moves, mate! I don't hear excuses." Preston swiftly stands upright from his metal chair with a sneer and leans over, violently shoving Palmer inside his chair away from his girl Priam. Then Preston bends down, lifts up, and shuffles Priam inside her chair in the air and then back down into an empty spot on the other side of his person while protectively guarding his girl away from the human male.

Palmer turns and frowns at the nose profile on Preston, "I was..."

Blaze sits across from Preston and sneers at his fellow demon. "It was just an accident, Preston. Stay cool, tot! No one's going to bother Priam."

The female human sits beside Palmer with a smile and scans each new student, picking at the food tray. "Do you want to share your names? Or do I make something for you as I go along the way?"

Barbie sits across from Dolly and looks up with a nod to Dolly. "I'll start. My name is Barbie and I am not named after that silly doll either. I'm the first and only Barbie ever made. Isn't that right, sugar?" She turns with a smile and nudges the arm on her boyfriend Blaze.

He turns and kissing her food stained lips, pulling back with a smile. "Ich dien Barbie!"

Palmer looks up and frowns at Blaze, stumbling over the string of new words, "Ichi, duh, what does that expression mean?" he eats his food.

Blaze turns and nods to Palmer with a smile. "The expression comes from the ancient Latin language which translates into English as I serve, Barbie. I'm Blaze, her man. The only one ever made." He turns and kisses her lips again, pulling back with a smile.

"I'm Dolly." The teen female turns and nods to each new student.

"Holly." Morton sits beside Radium and next to Blaze, teasing the human with a smile.

"No." Dolly turns and frowns at Morton.

"Folly." Radium laughs at the human female too.

"No," she turns and frowns at Radium.

"Jolly." Blaze laughs and taunts the human female also.

"No," she frowns at Blaze.

"Nolly." Morton kids the Human.

"No!" Dolly repeats loudly.

"So, are you called, naughty, then?" Radium grins.

"Absolutely not!" Dolly huffs and shakes her brown hair with a sour frown.

Blaze nods with a smile. "O! So, it is Dolly, is it not?" He laughs with the other demons and angels.

Dolly exhales with annoyance at the gang of new students and slaps her chest with a smile. "My father is the head general here at the Key West Naval Station. He started the first of the year."

"So, you're an army brat." Morton teases the Human, smiling with perfect teeth.

"I'm a naval babe, sir." Dolly winks at Morton and laughs out loud.

Morton nods with a smile. "She's smart for a..."

"Do you smell...?" Dolly sniffs the air waves with her nostril

"I beg your pardon!" Blaze sneers.

Dolly rotates her ugly nostrils to the left and then sniffs. "I smell. The air smells like a basket of freshly picked blueberries..."

"... on pancakes. Where are the tall stacks of freshly baked blueberry pancakes?" Morton scans the kitchen grill missing that particular breakfast entrée.

Dolly frowns and sniffs the air waves. "No. I am not referencing a food item. I mean, I smell. The smell smells like a basket of freshly picked blueberries coming from the farm." She stands upright from her metal and waggles her nose while sniffing the sweet air currents, back stepping from the table. She slowly scoots around the table and continues to sniff the air currents with a smile, moving around each set of hair roots.

"Bow wow, doggie! Go, doggie." Morton laughs at Dolly and then eats the food.

"She's a wolf hound, sugar." Barbie laughs at Dolly.

"She's a bloodhound, tot." Blaze smiles at Dolly.

"You!" Dolly stops and stand over the hair roots on Blaze, pointing at his back spine, sniffing the air currents. "You smell like wild clove and basil."

Blaze continues to sit and winks at his girl Barbie. "That smell is my personal cologne, tot."

"You!" Dolly shuffles sideways and sniffs the air currents, pointing at the back spine on Barbie. "You, your body fragrance smells like a vase of wild orchids."

Barbie continues to sit and smiles. "Thank you very much, Dolly! You're very kind and complimentary today." She turns and winks at her demon guy Blaze as he leans over and hugs her body, kissing her cheekbone, pulling back with a smile. He eats the food.

"You!" Dolly hunts for the next odor and stops, standing directly behind the rear skull on Morton. "You, your body scent smells like a fresh aroma of lavender and..."

"... plum. I use that mixture that provides sensual elegant with a feminine whiff of garden roses. I mixture clings to my chest hairs, my two wrists bones, behind my two earlobes, at the back of my bent knees..." Morton reaches up and gently touches each one of his exposed body parts for a visual exhibition with a chuckle, leaning over, touching the same body parts on Radium. Morton smiles with delight.

"Yeah, baby!" Radium leans over and hugs his arms around his demon boyfriend Morton. Morton turns and winks at Radium with love.

"Not here, tots!" Blaze shakes his bone skull and continues to eat the breakfast food.

Morton turns and winks to Palmer. "My personal fragrance scent provides a long-lasting effect of sensuality. After bath showering, I spray on my fragrance over my body giving off a tantalizing and..."

"...sexy sinfully scent." Radium nods to Palmer with a smile.

"Thanks, Ra!" Morton turns and winks at his boyfriend.

Dolly sidesteps and stands behind the rear bone skull on Radium, sniffing the air currents, pointing at his back spine. "You, your body fragrance smells like the freshly picked basket of blueberries coming from the woodlands."

"Yeah, baby!" Radium leans over and hugs Morton for fun.

"Not here, tots!" Blaze continues to eat with a sour frown as the other students smile.

Dolly slowly scoots around the table and stands behind the bone skull on Priam, sniffing the current air waves. "You, your body smell is a lovely fresh corsage that I had used at the Spring Dance last year. The perfume mixture consists of carnations and irises."

"Thanks, Dolly!" Priam smiles and leans into her boyfriend Preston as he leans over and kisses her cheekbone.

Dolly sidesteps and stops, standing behind Preston, sniffing the air, pointing at his back spine with a smile. "You, your body smells like leather and sharp citrus."

Preston turns with a nod and leans over, kissing the lips on Priam.

Palmer wiggles side to side inside his chair and lifts up an arm in the air. "Me! Me! What about me, Dolly? What do I smell like to your bloodhound nostrils?"

She shuffles over and stands behind Palmer, leaning down into his dark brown hair roots, pulling back with a sour frown. "Bacon and eggs!" Dolly moves ahead and slides down into her chair, finishing her breakfast meal in silence.

At 09:02 am, inside the classroom, each summer school course consists of English, Math, History, Science, and a new surprise for the thirty-four students in attendance on the third week of school.

The wheat colored classroom contains three walls of solid paint and one wall holds a row of long and tall exposed glass windows that displays the vast and deep Gulf of Mexico waters in dark blue hue over the bright beams of blinding sunlight.

Morton departs from Radium and then turns, slowly moving down the middle on the second row of unique school desks.

Each ancient school desk contains numerous scratched up spots and many etched out proper and improper nouns and some nasty verbs on the colored metal surface. The row of student desks are not the typical ancient pieces of dark wood that forms an old-fashioned straight back rest with an attached wooden tray top and a cubby hole for the school textbook.

Each school desk is comprised of metal with personality.

From American ancient history, the hull on the USS Merrimack was a steam frigate of made of wood. She was launched into sea service on June 15, 1855 with a length of 275 feet and sped through the vast salty water at 12 knots, without firing armament. The frigate was decommissioned on February 16, 1860.

Then, the USS Merrimack was burned on the soil and then sunk down inside a dry dock on April 20, 1861. She was then raised up, cutting off the original hull and engines, converting her wooden hull into the Confederate iron-covered naval warship CSS Virginia.

The CSS Virginia was the first steam-powered ironclad warship built by the Confederate States Navy during the first year in the American Civil War. On March 8, 1862, the CSS Virginia entered into the war battle between the North and South.

The exterior change from a wooden hull into an iron one had been a crucial new innovation of naval warfare in the United States.

From ancient world history, the first warship had been introduced by the Assyrian Navy which was called a bireme that displayed a pointed bow and was propelled by two banks of human oarsmen around the year 700 BC.

The same technology was shared and copied by a group of bold and adventurous sea captains and sailors coming from the ancient countries of Mesopotamia, Ancient Persia, Ancient Greece, and the Roman Empire which had sailed on top of a galley. A galley was a long, narrow vessel that had been powered by banks of sweaty oarsmen too and designed to ram and then sink an enemy vessel using a bow-first method and then a follow up with a boarding parties of spears and swords and shouts.

The development of catapult technology in Fourth Century B.C. led to a sailing fleet of artillery-equipped warships during the Hellenistic Age.

In 14th Century A.D., the cannon weapon had become commonplace on all sea ships for protection and conquest. In 18th Century A.D., the invention of the smaller frigate that was used to protect merchant vessels and other warships during warfare and also used as a scout boat for an enemy ship.

During 19th Century A.D., a major battle revolution had occurred, the creation of an ironclad warship. The warship was decorated with an exterior iron shell on each side and on top of the deck, powered by steam propulsion, exhibited an armament of weapons which made the fleet of sailing wooden frigates ancient and obsolete.

Throughout the history of time and the discovery of additional earth minerals, the fleet of warships quickly advanced from steam sailing power with a soft steel hull armor into nuclear charged sailing power with a hard and sturdy titanium hull.

Each steel luxury cruise ship and battle warship is scrapped and then decommissioned because of corrosion on the exterior hull, not a problem with the internal machinery equipment and parts.

Here, at the NAS Key West military base, the group of stationed American soldiers possess too much enough time waiting on the next world war battle and slowly weld off large chunks of steel from each decommissioned warship and then have used their creativity to design tons of student desks for the local educational center.

Each high school student desk is comprised of steel metal from a decommissioned warship and painted in a different fun color. Each desk displays the usual tray to hold the school books or your naked hands, if you do not like learning new subjects. And each desk contains a seat to hold the butthole and a back rest for your back spine. However, each tray is not shaped like the boring and usual square shape but displays a unique design formation, such like, a triangle or an oval or a teardrop or a narrow rectangle or a circle or a parallelogram or a star with four to eight points, making sitting fun, if you do not like to learn.

Each sitting seat is not the usual square shape either and displays a fun design formation that only your butthole enjoys sitting inside an unique geometric mathematical figure that matches your attached tray.

Now, each back rest is not the usual short, square shaped design either but exhumes a unique personality coming from each talented military welders. Some of the unique designs include one of many royal throne-themed back rests with two large steel balls on each side of your skull or a right-sliding back rest that leans more to the right than the left or a left-sliding back rest or a folded back rest, where you can lean your neck muscles and sleep through each class session. There is a folded forward arm that bleeds into the tray, where you can place your face down on the surface and sleep soundly during each class session.

Inside the classroom, on the second row, Morton slides down and leans his upper body forward over the purple tinted folded arm and matching parallelogram shaped tray, breathing down the neck muscle on Priam. He lifts up his palm and giggles with silliness, waiting on Priam.

Priam sits in front of Morton inside a lavender tinted princess throne-themed student desk with two tiny balls in-between her eardrums while allowing Morton to see the white board in front of the class session, where he only sleeps in peace during each school session. She spins around with a giggle and gently taps his upright palm with a smile, swinging around, tapping her naked fingers on top of the narrow rectangle tray with a matching seat. She turns and winks at her boyfriend Preston.

Preston sits inside a red tinted king throne-themed back rest with a triangle shaped student tray and matching seat in the middle of the first row and an empty student desk behind the rear skull on Radium. He turns and winks at his girlfriend Priam.

Radium occupies the first student desk that displays a folded back rest, where he can lean his neck muscles backwards and extend his pair of long legs within empty air molecules while sleeping through each class session. His student tray is shaped into a teardrop design with a matching seat in the hue of dark amber.

Blaze sits down inside a left-sliding back rest on the student desk in dark green hue that leans more to the left and towards his girlfriend Barbie, sitting on top of a circle shaped seat with a matching tray.

Barbie slides down behind Preston inside a right-sliding back rest on the student desk in bright orange tint that leans more to the right and allows her to touch her boyfriend Blaze, sitting on top of an oval shaped seat with a matching tray.

Barbie turns with a smile and grabs his extended hand while Colee marches down in-between the first and second columns of school desks and then stops, sneering down at the entwined demon arms.

Barbie releases the hand on Blaze, before Colee attracts attention from the school teacher. Colee moves ahead with a lady growl and slides down into a yellow tinted queen throne-themed student color with a stupid five-shaped star designed seat that pinches the back of her legs and a matching tray that tears her delicate clothing. She sit behind Blaze with a sneer and turns with a smile staring at the nose profile on Preston.

Each demon or angel displays their individual colorful, fashionable military-style clothing like yesterday, but nicely cleaned by their supernatural magic inside their private den chamber.

In front of the high school classroom behind a white tinted writing board, a light pale flat teacher desk stands in the middle of the room without a book or a stack of papers and holds a left-sliding back rest with an oval seat in pink hue. The high school teacher displays a light green tinted tee shirt, a pair of dark blue trousers, and a set of dark blue shoes, measuring five feet and five inches in height with a head of blonde hair, a pair of brown eyes, and a tone of dark skin. She sits behind her teacher desk of white tinted metal with a padded chair of metal green hue, smiling at her students. "Today, we're going on a field trip." Miss R represents the shorten version of her formal name, Mrs. Robertson. She continues to nod with a smile. "There are three outdoors activities which are required by the US Federal Government to complete your physical education course for this summer school session."

Palmer sits on the three row in the middle of the columns of student desks turning with a smile to see the nose profile on Blaze. "It sounds fun."

"It sounds wicked." Blaze reaches out and slaps the collar bone on Morton, who sits in front of him.

"It sounds dangerous for some of us, humans." Radium turns and laughs at Palmer.

At the teacher desk, Miss R continues to nod with a smile to the students. "The day is pretty. We don't have any hurricanes in the weather forecast yet. Hurricane warnings develop later in the year around last August and September, which is new information for my new students here at the military base. Our class assignment is very simply and benefits ecologically our world and our environment. You and your classmates are picking up disgusting and dirty wads of trash and garbage on the sides of each roadway."

"Boo!" A student voice yells out loud.

"No!" A second student voice screams out loud.

"Yay!" A third student voice shouts out loud.

Miss R nods with a stern face, "There will be four teams here. So, get together and pick all of you trash mates," she laughs with some of the students.

In the second row behind Radium, Preston turns and smiles at Priam on the first row, stretching out his arm to her desk, holding her hand. "You and me..."

"... and me..." Morton sits upright behind Priam and waves both of his arms in the air with a smile.

"... and I ..." Radium reaches over with a smile and jabs a finger at Morton.

"... and us..." Barbie reaches over and grabs Blaze's hand also with a smile.

On the fourth row, in the middle section, Dolly reaches over and slaps Palmer hand with a nod. "We wanna join the fun, too." She wants to continue her spying assignment on the group of new students as set by her father.

At 09:47 am, among parted clouds of bright sunlight with 90 degrees Fahrenheit, one of the white colored school vans stops and drops off a group of teenagers on top of a heated and paved road that is covered with a set of overhanging tree branches coming from numerous purple, pink and yellow tinted flowering trees. Then the school van disappears around the street corner.

Blaze, Barbie, Preston, Priam, Radium, and Morton move around and scatter around the trees.

Morton stops and stands on the edge of the gray tinted paved road way, waving both of his hands in the air. Each piece of trash consisting of empty soda cans, dead tree limbs, and food-wrapped paper items magically float up from the ground and then drop down into one of three green tinted trash bens that line the paved street. His hands continue to waiver back and forth. The trash lid lifts up from the ground and then drop down into place over the ben, sealing the garbage can for further processing steps by the base personnel of NAS.

"Done! Let's go and par-tee!" Morton wipes his set of clean hands down over his trousers with a laugh, leaning over and kisses Radium, pulling back with a smile.

"Let's try this path." Preston grabs Priam's hand and gently pulls her ahead, moving away from Morton and Radium, lightly chatting about the different types of tropical fruits, trees and shrubs.

"This forest site looks like the Tropical Forest and Botanical Garden on College Street in downtown Key West," Priam scans the ground with a variety of ground vegetation.

"We can go the Botanical Garden after school. You and I can walk around and eat our dinner meal there." Preston hugs and whispers into her eardrum.

"I spy a key lime tree over there," she chuckles.

He smiles. "Yes, we share a piece of key lime pie for dessert after our dinner meal at the Tropical Gardens. Or we could walk downtown Key West."

"I spy a shaggy pine tree."

"It will be just us two, alone and away, from Morton and Radium."

She smiles at the next tree. "I spy a mimosa flowering tree. Look how each one of the curvy branches spreads out into the air which is like an oak tree but smaller. This pic evokes the feeling of a Japanese garden. Don't you think so, Preston?"

He stops and turns, leaning down, kissing her lips, pulling with a smile. He continues to stand and waves a hand, materializing a basket of picnic food with his demon magic, turning to seek a desired spot among the colorful flora and green bushes. He nudges Priam towards the nearest tree with a smile. "No mimosa juice or flowers will drop down a set of sticky stuff on us and our food. Let's head south of that tree."

She moves with Preston. "Okay! The shade is cooler over here while the color of the tree is much prettier also. That tree has purple leaves, instead of chartreuse green..."

"...with a set of pinkish red sticky flowers," he frowns and shakes his blonde hair with disapproval.

"Okay, Mr. Clean." She laughs and points at the next grove of shade trees. "I spy a locust berry tree or a black olive tree or..."

"Let's move over and sit in front of the legume tree." Preston leads and holds her hand.

The large twisted brown spine stands ten feet high up from the golden sands with an overhanging glossy, green colored canopy of leaves, providing a nice cool shade from the intense sunlight of Florida. Fragrant white, pink, and purple tiny clusters of flowers smell like a garden roses that flows into her nostrils.

Preston stops and stands in front of the legume tree with a smile, holding her hand, waving his free hand with the basket. He releases the basket as the basket with the picnic food items hangs in the air waves. The lid on the basket lifts upright and exposes the contents inside the pocket. A folded red colored blanket slowly rises from the interior and then halts in the air waves, slowly unfolding out into full size, slowly dropping down over the shorter grass underneath the cool shade tree. Then each food item slowly rises up from the pocket of the basket and then gently drops down on the edge of the blanket, forming a placement for the lunch meal. The basket carefully drops down and sits on top of the grass in silence.

Preston moves ahead with a smile, holds her hand, and then stops, leaning over, kissing her lips. He pulls back with a smile and assists her to sit down on top of the blanket, sitting down beside Priam. They eat, chat, and kiss each other smaller body parts with love.

At 10:10 am, in the close distance, a loud voice shouts out loud, "Shade!" Palmer slowly moves ahead with a sweaty, red colored face towards the same legume tree with Preston and Priam, plopping down on top of the red blanket. He displays a pair of dirty hands, trousers, and hiking boots, seeing the sweet refreshment. "Water!" He reaches down and stoles the bottle of water. Preston continues to cuddle Priam and turns to sneer at Palmer. Palmer gulps down the stolen bottled of water with loud noises, spilling the wet contents over his dirty body and the clean blanket while Priam reaches out and gently strokes Preston's chest muscles while calming down her man with a smile.

Radium and Morton appear in the same area with Preston and Priam, slowly moving ahead while hugging each other. They stop and stand in front of the new tree. Morton points to the tree with a smile. "I spy a _Milletia pinnata._ This particular tree species associated with the pea family."

Palmer drops down the empty bottle of water and burps out loud with a smile, turning to see Radium and Morton, slowly standing upright from the blanket. He spins around, moves ahead, stops with puzzlement, standing beside the same tree with Radium and Morton. He continues to gather data for his spying mission regarding the gang of new students. He stares at the native Florida tree. "This particular tree species associated with the pea family. Where are the peas?"

"The pea pods arrive later in the year. Each crop of almond-sized peas appears along with a batch of black colored flies. The flies like, eat and enjoy the yummy gum." Radium stares at the tree with a laugh.

"The tree bark is used to make twine or rope for human needs and also yields the natural element of black gum to treat wounds on humans which are caused by the numerous types of poisonous fish from the Atlantic Ocean. The wood limbs can easily split into fragments for firewood, fence posts, and tool handles." Morton smiles and lectures to Palmer, holding a wicker brown colored basket with a free hand that contains numerous food items. He opens the lid and grabs the blanket, tossing the item in the air. The falling blanket magical unfolds and then gently lands outstretching down on top of the short grass, preparing the area for the lunch picnic.

Morton moves ahead and sits down on top of the blanket with a chuckle, unloading each food item over the fabric, gathering a handful of slice red colored apple slices. Radium joins Morton with a smile while Palmer continues to stand beside the tree and gently swats away a black colored fly that has landed on his hand.

"The seeds are used for oleic acid which is known as honge oil." Radium continues to lecture as Morton leans over and gently hand-feeds Radium a juicy apple slice. Radium eats the food with a smile.

"It sounds Japanese." Palmer continues to stand with puzzlement and swats away three black colored flies which are bombarding his eye sockets, nostrils, and both of his hands.

Radium gently hand-feeds Morton one of the juicy apple slice with a smile. "The tree oil has been used for products, such like, lamp oil, ingredients of soap making, and lubricant for thousands upon thousands of years."

"What kind of lubricant?" Palmer continues to stand by the tree and slap a platoon of black colored flies that are attacking his face, his neck, and both of his hands.

Radium smiles. "The tree oil is used for body lubricant. Each fruit and sprout is used in traditional medical remedies. The juice from the pea plant is used as a body oil in all antiseptic medications which retards the pests."

Morton shoves a steaming hot dog wiener butt end into Radium's open mouth with a smile and continues the lecture. "Pests, you know and call them, bugs, Palmer," he laughs as Radium tenderly shoves the butt end on the hot dog wiener into Morton's mouth. They slowly chew and swallow the hot dogs, leaning over, kissing each other.

"Flies." Palmer continues to stand by the tree and violently swats his face, arms, hands, and fingers with an army of attacking black colored flies.

Morton pulls back from the kiss with a laugh. "Yeah, a fly is a bug, palmer." He reached down and places two straws inside the single cold beverage, sharing the drink with Radium.

Palmer starts to dash around the pea tree, trying to escape from a nest of black colored flies. Each fly buzzes after him for fun. Then he carelessly stumbles on exposed tree root and drops down over the short grass, looking up with a gasp, reaching out for the grounded object. He slowly stands upright and displays the object in his hand with puzzlement. "Hey! Look at this! I found an almond-shaped pea like Radium described. But I thought the pea pod arrived later in the year."

"Yeah, that's a pea pod. Slap it on your face." Radium grins as Morton tenderly places another chocolate covered strawberry inside Radium's open mouth.

"Why should I slap my own face?" Palmer continues to stand beside the tree and swats away each invading black fly.

"The oil inside the pea pod will retard the pests, Palmer." Morton chews and swallows the chocolate covered strawberry from Radium as they smile and chuckle at each other.

On top of the red colored blanket, Preston turns and smiles at Palmer while eating more food. Priam sits beside Preston and watches Radium's torment on the human teen male also, eating her food in silence.

Beside the tree, Palmer breaks the pea skin and splatters the yellow tinted oil and tiny bits of golden sand over his itchy face, exposed naked throat and both hands. He sits down on top of the short grass and rubs the yellow oil over the nose bridge between his eyeglasses rim, displaying chumps of black pea skin and yellow tinted oil over his face.

On top of the white blanket, Morton sniffs the current airs and spins around with a smile jabbing a finger at Palmer, nodding with an evil laugh. "Yum! The human smells good enough to eat, Radium."

"You need to consume the sprout, also, Palmer. That will really get rid of all the black flies that continue to buzz your head." Radium smiles at Palmer.

Blaze and Barbie appear and stroll hand in hand and then stop, standing a few feet from the white blanket with Radium and Morton, staring at the Palmer.

"What's that thing?" Blaze chuckles and stares at the human.

"I break the pea pod skin and applied the yellow tinted body lubricant over my body from the attacking black colored flies." Palmer continues to smear more of the broken pea shells and oil over his exposed naked human flesh with a smile.

"I spy a pod of peas on the tree. That's very odd for this time of year." Blaze examines the _Milletia pinnata_ tree and then Palmer with full understanding, jabbing at finger at Morton, shaking his bone skull with a smile. "What in the hell did he told you, tot?"

"The pea oil retards the pests, flies from my body." Palmer drops the broken pea pod and leans down with a gag, holding his stomach while turning pale white on his distorted face.

Blaze chuckles with a nod at Palmer. "That pea plant ain't really toxic, but it will induce both nausea and vomiting, if eaten. Don't ever listen to him, Palmer. Morton likes to lie, cheat, and steal from you, humans," he laughs with his demon friends.

"You're very bad, Morton!" Barbie shakes her curls and jabs her red tinted manicured fingernail at the naughty demon.

Morton looks up and smiles at Barbie. "It is my nature. I'm a demo, demonic being." He laughs with the other.

Palmer leans over and puke up his breakfast items from a pair of red swollen lips.

At 04:46pm, at the southeastern most corner of the North American continent, on South Street in downtown Key West, among the heated sunray at 88, a solid concrete geometric cone statue stands upright on top of the vanilla colored sideway and displays bright red, black, and yellow alternating paint strips from the tip down to the base. The cone stands upright and still among a dull pinkish-red horizon that forms over the Atlantic Ocean waters, measuring twelve feet in high, ten feet wide in diameter and weighs two tons. The stripped Cone represents the southernmost corner of the United States of America that protects the grassy parks and concrete sideways from bodily harm.

Preston leans into the cone with a smile and silently watches his girl. Priam stands in front of the steel railing that overlooks the ocean water, performing an array of mouth whistles and hand waves. She commands the water ballet with a pod of gray bottle nose dolphin consisting of high jumps, elegant leaps, and backward flips for her amusement beside the cone and Preston. She turns and winks to Preston while clapping for the dancing pod of dolphins.

Early, Preston and Priam had escape the military base and eaten an early supper meal in downtown Key West at one of famous restaurants which was owned by numerous American singers and American book authors.

Preston enjoys the freedom and an escape from other angels and demons, where he can spend time alone with his girl Priam between school courses and their curfew.

After the supper meal, they had enjoyed the usual routine, strolling cheek to cheek up and down the beige colored sideways, chatting about their day until they had reached the famous Earnest Hemingway House with its 42 roaming cats for some feline petting time on each new baby kitten that had been found by Preston and enjoyed by Priam.

Next, they had traveled by foot inside the Key West Tropical Botanical Garden, where Priam likes to touch and smell every different type of flora surrounding the gardens and then childishly plays on the three swings and one giant slide within the playground equipment while Preston watches protectively.

The final step of the evening city tour, before leaving the city of Key West, in time for curfew rests at the Cone.

Priam swings around with a smile and waves at the pod of dolphins that swim further away from her and into the vastness of the Atlantic Ocean waters, slowly spinning around, prancing into his open arms with a giggle.

He hugs Priam and leans down, placing his cheekbone on top of her soft brown hair, closing his eyelids. He savors her sweet smell of fresh carnations and iris and He whispers softly. "I love you, lambie pie."

Priam wiggles free from his chest and pulls back from his hug while admiring his pale blue eyeballs and his handsome smile, nodding with a smile. "We are here. We are free. Now, let's run away, together, Preston. Right now!"

Preston leans over and kisses her forehead, then the tip of her nose, sliding down, kissing her lips. He pulls back with a stern face. "No Priam. Curfew is soon. So, enjoy..."

"They, they can help us." She points out to the sea and nods with a smile. "I've talked to them. The pod of dolphins can lead us to a safe place and away from here and curfew. We could be together, forever, Preston."

He smiles into her beautiful turquoise eyes. "We are together every day..."

"...but not at night..."

"I love you, lambie pie." He leans down and kisses her lips, pulling back with a smile, seeing her frown. He places his finger and thumb pad between each cheekbone, pushing up her smooth skin into a happy face. He chuckles with delight.

She giggles with a smile. "Let's go and escape, right now, please, Preston." Priam pulls away from him and slides down her hand into his hand, dragging him toward the ocean waters.

He continues to hold her hand and shakes his blonde skull with a stern face. "We must obey and attend curfew, Priam."

"I want us to be together for twenty-four hours in both the day and the night, Preston. I can't do that. I'm only a demon." She frowns and recalls all of her painful memories.

"And I'm only an angel." He nods.

"So, who do we ask about changing the rule here, Preston?" She crosses her arms and wears a stern face.

He produces a single pink tinted carnation with his angel-magic and hands the flower to her with a smile. She smiles and accepts the flower, smelling the flower. He nods. "The flower smells lovely like you and it is pink colored that matches your pretty little wings," he leans over and hugs her with a smile.

She talks into his chest. "I remember dancing during Prom Night in the year 1951 in the US State of New Jersey. We danced on top of that stinky gymnasium on our cold feet."

He pulls back from the hug and smiles at her. "We danced in socked feet, lambie pie."

"I removed my Bobbie socks, so I could dance to the Hop Scotch better," she giggles.

"You are beautiful now and then, lambie pie. I remember you in that white plantation dress during Prom Night in the year 1978 in the US State of Alabama, a true southern belle." He smiles at his girl.

"I liked that dress. It was big and wide like girls wore..." she pauses and then smiles. "Will you marry me, Preston?"

He reaches down and lifts up, kissing her hand, each finger pads, and then her wrist bone.

A few feet near the cone, the male human carelessly stumbles over his two big feet in a forward motion and reaches out, grabbing the loose steel chain, before tumbling head first down into the Atlantic Ocean while trying to capture on his personal mobile telephone the pod of dolphin. He jerks to the side and catches his upright balance, reaching out, grabbing the nearest object, Priam.

Priam yelps in pain, after the tall male human slammed into her back spine which stopped his inertia.

Preston leans over and wraps both of his arms around the human and Priam, stopping their sideways tumble down into the ocean waters, quickly back stepping from the edge of the railing and slaps his back spine against the concrete cone with a loud grunt. He body spins with a 180 degree turn and pen the back spine on the human against the concrete cone, jerking Priam from the pair of human hands, growling down into the face on the human with murderous intent.

Priam shuffles away from the human, stops, and then spins around tugging on Preston's arms with a worried brow. "Preston! I'm fine, Preston. Let's go from here, please."

Preston grunts another unwelcomed warning into the cheekbone on the human and releases his hold, spinning around with a sneer, cuddling Priam. The human drops down hard on top of the hard concrete sidewalk shivering from fear. Preston swiftly jog with Priam and moves further into the park with thick hanging overhanging shade trees, tiny rays of sunlight on top of the manicured lawn and a breezy windy paths as they suddenly stop.

Preston explodes out a pair of 23 feet of solid red colored angel wings as a set of old and worn dull feathers that lightly flutter and float in the air waves, landing down on top of the green grass while each angel feathers dissolve into nothingness silently. He smiles at Priam. She imitates his motion and explodes out her pair of 18 feet demon wings in solid coral hue.

Preston holds her hand and as they bend their legs and then launch silently up in the pale blue sky of Key West while soaring back home to the NAS military base.

Preston and Priam continue to hold hands and glide down low, sailing above the blue ocean waves while expertly riding the air currents with the pair of aerodynamic wings as each dolphin from the pod follow the supernatural beings at 45 miles-per-hour while jumping from the water, leaping in the air in a graceful flip, and falling back down in a pretty arch for fun and travel.

Priam points the object with a free hand. "Preston, look over there in the southwestern horizon. I spy on a pod of humpback whales."

"Can you hear the whales also?" He turns and smiles at the sight.

"I can feel them just like the playfully intelligent dolphins below us."

"You're very special to me, lambie pie." He pulls her closer into his body underneath his wing for protection.

"Watch me, Preston!" She breaks free from his wing and then drops down, diving toward the water, folding her wings and arms against her body without stopping with a giggle of adventure.

"Priam!" He continues to fly in a straight line with a gasp and observes her movement.

Each dolphin leaps up from the water and then dives back deep into blue water as the closest dolphin leaps up from the water and arches high in the sky, Priam flies under the sparkling ocean rainbow left by flying mammal and then exits safe and unharmed, flying upright in the skyline, cheering and clapping with delight. She calls out to the dolphin. "Again!" The dolphin continues to jump up and then dive back down into the water. Then the single dolphin is joined by two of her sea friends, leaping higher up towards the white roaming clouds. Priam dives down and then swoons underneath the watery rainbow arch left by the two jumping dolphins while laughing with fun.

Preston halts and hangs in the air waves watching the dolphin performance as he sweeps his wings across the skyline, maintaining an upright position, carefully watching Priam also. the pod of dolphins will not harm Priam, but each one of their bigger physically body outweighs her tiny body by over one hundred pounds. So, an air collision with the flying dolphin would injury his girl in both pain and blood.

Priam is an unearthly creature but uses her two lungs to breath in air and possesses red tinted blood proteins that pump through her heart in order to survive here on Planet Earth along with Preston. Priam air dances over and then underneath each flying sea mammal, laughing with happiness.

In the pale blue sky, Preston enjoys her fun and carefully observes the daylight rays that dust a painted scene in the rich colors of yellow and red on the new horizon hinting at the first sign of a western sunset here in the US State of Florida. He glides down with grace on each wing and then reaches out, catching his girl by one of her arms, before she executes a nose dive down toward the water again, cuddling her into his chest. He whispers softly. "Time to go home, Priam."

Priam hears his words and frowns. "Okay."

He and she together lean down and soar parallel with the ocean waves flying back toward the beach sands at the H Building. They halt over the sands and then slowly stand upright in the air, slowly landing down on a set of booted feet while laughing with delight. Priam spins around and kisses his lips.

From the H building setting, Morton swiftly exits the entrance archway and jabs a finger at Priam, yelling out loud with his worries, like a father figure. "You are wet and late. Now, you get inside that building and into your private bedroom, before you catch your death, Priam." Then he fingers and yells out loud with fury at Preston. "You are not wet and late. And you know that you shouldn't keep Priam out so long, Preston. Curfew."

"Curfew." Preston nods with a stern face and leans over, kissing his lips.

Morton stops and stands behind Priam with a sour frown, reaching out, grabbing her naked arm. He drags ahead and separates her from a mellow Preston while heading back into the demon den which is located on the right side door inside the H Building, entering the common hallway.

Preston slowly moves ahead to the building and enters, veering to the left door of his angel home as Preston and Priam turn and stares at each other from the opposite archway.

"I will wink and then kiss your lips tomorrow morning at 6:01 am. I love you, Preston." Priam calls out with a smile and then spins around, entering the open archway, disappearing into the assigned demon den.

"Sweet dreams, lambie pie! I love you, Priam!" Preston shouts out loud with a smile and then sighs, spinning around with a sad face, entering his angel hole alone.

Another day of school attendance with numerous school assignments and finally school session ends, the gang of happy demons and angels gather for the final hours of the evening, eating the dinner meal before curfew outside the rows of picnic tables in the nice, sunny Florida weather.

On the long row of natural wooden looking picnic tables, in the last one, Morton sits beside Radium while playing a game of footies underneath the table.

Blaze and Barbie sits on the opposite side of Morton and Radium and share a set of secret words with each other between bites of food and bits of kisses.

Preston and Priam cuddle on the table end as he feeds her pieces of slice hotdog pieces that is smeared in ketchup and mustard the way Priam likes it.

A tall female slowly sashays from the H Building and totes a plate of food while observing each angel and demon at the same shared picnic table.

"Ah, shucks!" Morton looks up and views the front of the building, staring at the new visitor with a sour frown, "She found me."

"Who are you?" The female stops and stands on the opposite end table from Preston and Priam, wearing a sour face, gently dropping down her plate of food on top of the wood. She stands five feet and nine inches in height and displays a head of wild frizzy ash blonde hair that flows from an oval face, a pair of light green pupils on her copper colored skin, and perfectly applied lipstick painted orange painted lips with a set of sharply manicured matching fingernails.

"Who are you?" Radium continues to sit beside Morton and looks up with a smile, repeating the question for fun and entertainment.

She crosses her arms with a sour frown and wears an orange colored sleeveless blouse, a matching short skirt, and a matching pair of fashionable high heels, staring down at Morton. "Who is he?"

Preston ignores the tall female and the silly bantering, whispering into Priam's eardrum as she giggles.

"Who are you, tot?" Blaze sits across from Morton with a chuckle and looks up with a smile, repeats the same question for fun and annoyance. Barbie leans over and punches the bicep on her bad angel, smiling at the tall female.

"Colee." The tall female sits down and eats her meal, staring at Preston.

"What is a Colee?" Morton laughs.

Radium bumps into Morton and nods with a smile. "Use your cell phone and look up the surname Colee!"

"O! Great idea, honey!" Morton pulls out his personal mobile telephone from the jacket with a smile and taps on the tiny keyboard while accessing the internet with a smile. "C...o...l.."

"Don't, bother." Colee frowns at each one of the rude beings and continues to eat the diner meal. She has endured their insults and rude comments for centuries as she has known the set of guys and gals for thousands and thousands of centuries, before they all started hanging around Preston.

Blaze reaches down and pulls out his mobile telephone from the trousers' pocket, duplicating the sound of soft beeps, like Morton's devise, and then smiles with a laugh. "Ah, shucks! She's hiding something from us."

"It says: She's not found." Morton looks up with a smile and points down at the screen with a laugh, typing on the keyboard again to further his research.

"You don't exist, dove. Take the hint, flap your wings, and go far, far away from me!" Radium sneers at Colee.

Blaze points down at the tiny screen on his phone with a smile. "Here! Here are some partial results from a crossword puzzle, where the first three letters represent the word cola or colaba or colaborer or colander or colanders or..."

"You don't exist. You can leave now, babe." Radium sneers at Colee and points at the sinking sun over the water that hints at curfew. Colee shakes her blonde curls at Radium and continues to finish her meal.

"Colaptes or colas or..." Blaze annoys Colee and the other supernatural beings for fun reading off the screen on his mobile phone.

"Colas? I'm suddenly very thirsty." Radium laughs and shows each chewed food particle on his teeth to Colee.

Morton finishes his evening meal and continues to insult his enemy Colee for fun, scanning each face with a sour frown, "I just told ya'll. Colee doesn't exist with a reference or word or noun or verb or adverb or adjective translations..."

"Here!" Radium joins the fun with his friends at the picnic table while looking up the word Colee on his personal mobile telephone with a sneer. He finds more references and points down at the tiny screen. "I found it here! She is a home or a set of homes with furniture. Colee is the newest structures of homes here in Miami, Florida," he laughs with the others but Colee.

"No, I'm not." Colee continues to sit and shouts loud out with fury at one of her numerous enemies Radium, picking at her food plate of salad.

Blaze continues to research word that start with the first three letters of her name, Col, reading out loud with a laugh, "I have found these words on my cell, including colature, Colbert, cobertine, colborne, colby..."

Radium continues to look down and smile at the tiny screen, reading the information out loud to his friends. "Colee is a furniture store in the great US State of Louisiana."

"No!" Colee yells out loud and exhales with annoyance at her enemies, still picking at her salad.

"Colchicaceae, colchicine, colchicum, colchine..." Blaze continues to find on his mobile phone and then read out loud each word that begins with the three alphabetic letters of Col.

"Colee is a lawyer in great US State of Alabama." Radium laughs out loud and reads from the tiny screen on his personal mobile telephone.

Colee turns and yells at Radium. "Shut up, Radium!"

On the opposite end of the picnic table, Preston sits beside his girl Priam and swallows the food, sneering at his friend and then his enemy. "Chill, Morton! Be quiet, Colee." He turns and winks at Priam, resuming his hand-feeding plus his hand-kissing on Priam as she eats with closed lips in a smirk.

"Here! I finally find it. Colee comes from the de la Chevalerie which is located in the foreign country of France in the year 1818." Radium looks up with a smile and scans each face, pointing down at the tiny screen on his mobile telephone.

Morton types on the tiny keyboard and watches the tiny screen, reading out the same information. "De la Chevalerie was a Roman Catholic nun of the Sacred Hearts of Henriette Aymer de Chevalierie born on November, the eighth, in the year 1767."

"A nun! No way, Hosea!" Blaze looks up with a sour frown and shakes his skull with disagreement, jabbing a finger at Morton. "No. Go and find another engine for that motor, that one's rusty and leaking dirty oil." He laughs with his friends.

Morton continues to type on the tiny keyboard and watches the tiny screen, reading out loud for each pair of eardrums. "Colee is from the famous Raoul Daufresne de la Chevalerie, who was born on March 17th in the year 1881. Colee is a Belgian sportsman from the city of Bruges who died in the city of Ukkel. Colee was a Spanish football player in the year 1903..."

"French, Belgian, Spanish, Colee is all over the earth, tot. Did you disguise your presence as cousins or mama?" Blaze laughs out with humor. He has had for eternity the bad honor of knowing the true Colee without accessing any of the proper internet references.

Colee scans each face with a smile. "I am an angel."

Morton looks up and frowns at Colee. "O!"

Radium laughs with a nod. "That's a big O.M.G!"

Barbie jabs a finger at Colee and a sour frown in shock. "You're joking, right, Colee? She is teasing us, isn't that right, ya'll?"

Colee stares at Preston. "I am not the tease here."

Preston returns back and stares at Colee with a stern face while shuffling both of his hands, tickling on Priam for fun as she giggles with a grin. He leans over and kisses her forehead still staring at Colee in silence.

Morton frowns at Colee. "O! Now, I remember. You're the big whiny hatchling spawn of Satan, Colee. Yeah, right!" He turns and smiles at Priam, waving both hands in the air holding his mobile telephone. "Now, let us go and research the proper name of Priam. Priam doesn't mind playing our fun word game, do you?" He looks down and types on the keyboard with a smile.

Priam continues to wiggle with laughter without answering the question as Preston continues to tickle her body.

Radium types on the tiny keyboard with a smile and reads off the tiny screen. "Priam is the royal king of Troy."

Priam shoves Preston from her body and sits upright with heavy breathes from fun exhaustion, clearing her throat, saying with a smile to each friend. "No! He was originally known as King Podarces and then he changed his royal name to my name. I am the first Priam..."

"...the first princess of nothing," Colee laughs at Priam.

Preston returns back and sneers at Colee. "Shut up, Colee!" He cuddles Priam and turns, smiling into her face as she wiggles with happiness.

Blaze types on the tiny keyboard from his personal mobile telephone and reads out loud from the tiny screen for each pair of eardrums. "King Podarces had changed his name to the King Priam, after he had survived a vicious assassin attempt on his life due to the golden colored long face veil that had been given to him by his royal sister, who had been credited for saving his royal life."

Inside the wrapped arms on Preston, Priam reaches up and shuffles her golden colored hair ribbon from her hair roots, holding it over her naked forehead while producing a short golden colored veil that hides her face from each one of her friends. She giggles behind the shiny mask.

Morton looks up and buzzes his lips, tossing both arms in the air. "I give up."

Barbie nods with a smile and jabs a finger at Priam, "Priam tells the truth."

"So, are you King Podarces' royal sister?" Blaze looks up and frowns at Priam, who is still hidden behind the short golden colored veil.

She reaches up and shifts the golden veil from her face as the veil morphs into a horizontal long golden satin hair ribbon. She adjusts the girly ribbon back over the center of her hair roots and smiles at each friend, "I am Priam."

Every face stares back at Priam in silence.

Blaze turns and stares at Preston for an answer to his question. Preston leans over and hugs Priam, kissing her forehead, pulling back with a smile in silence as she giggles with happiness.

Radium looks down and types on the keyboard, reading out loud the information on the tiny screen. "It says here the etymology basis for the word, Priam, comes from the Greek language. The Greek word is _priatos_ and it translates into 'ransomed.' Why would it mean that, Priam?" He looks up with confusion at Priam

"I..." stutter with clueless as Priam frowns back at Radium and his question.

"Okay!" Morton yells out loud, "Everyone, look up one or many references for the proper name of Preston!" He looks down and types on the tiny keyboard with a smile.

Preston smiles at Radium. "I would say that those Greeks were some type of witty peoples. Do you think so, too, Radium?"

"Wow! Preston is everywhere on Planet Earth." Morton lifts upright the face on his phone near his smile.

"That's me!" Preston sips and then swallows his cold beverage, nodding with a smile to each friend.

"Preston is located in assortment of numerous the US States including Connecticut, Georgia, Texas. In the State of Texas, you have a roadway named after your person, is that right, tot?" Blaze looks up and frowns at Preston.

"Preston Road, it is a very important intersection in American History for the tiny town of Dallas which was built over a long, heated, dirt coated cattle trail." Preston smiles and strokes Priam's soft hair.

"How many cows ventured over that long, heated, dirt-coated cattle trail, tot?" Blaze laughs.

"Dead or alive?" Preston turns and winks to Blaze.

"Preston is located all over the country of England. What happened there at the town of Lancashire within the country of England?" Barbie read out loud from the tiny screen on her mobile telephone, looking up with a smile to Preston.

Morton continues to read the tiny screen for each pair of eardrums. "Preston is in the city of Duns within the country of Scotland. He is in Nova Scotia, Canada. He is in Tasmania, Australia ..."

"What! I can't believe this. Preston is not located within the country of India?" Blaze teases with a funny tone.

"That'd be later in this century, Blaze." Preston softly chuckles and tickles Priam again as she giggles with happiness beside his body.

"This is a ridiculously boring word game. Don't you, demons possess any better entertainment facilities or maybe faculties? Or is it fatalities rather than this silly nonsense?" Colee finishes the salad and wipes her mouth, scanning the table with her enemies.

Morton looks up and smiles at Colee. "Yeah, we like to use our faculties or brain cell unlike you, Colee. Now, let each one of us, demons look up and find her 'other' name!"

Blaze turns and frowns at Colee. "Her 'other' name, what is her 'other' name here?"

Colee turns and frowns at Morton, "'Other' name? I don't have another name. What are you talking about? What 'other' name do you reference?"

Morton tilts his jaw line with a smile. "Isn't it obvious?"

"Uh, no!" Blaze frowns.

"Colee is also cobra, that's her other name." Morton nods as Blaze laughs.

"Who is cobra?" Barbie eats her food and stares at Colee.

"Her!" Blaze points Colee and laughs out loud.

Each person looks down and types on the keyboard, searching for the name cobra.

Morton finds the item first and reads off the tiny screen on his mobile telephone. "Cobra, the proper noun represents any of the several highly venomous Old World elapid snakes from the genera _Naja_ and _Ophiophagus_. Colee as a cobra has ability to flatten out her neck into..."

"Shut up, Morton." Colee shouts out loud with fury.

"Chill, Colee!" Preston looks up and sneers at Colee while enjoying the impromptu roast and toast of the evil supernatural female.

Radium looks down with a smile and reads out loud from the tiny screen on his personal mobile telephone while laughing out loud, "See the other word, serpent,".

Colee screams out loud at each annoying demon. "Shut up!"

"Colee is a serpent!" Blaze turns and laughs at Colee.

Morton looks down and views the screen with a smile reading out loud the new information for each pair of eardrums. "Thank you, Radium, for that excellent wordy suggestion. I like this definition much, much better. A serpent is a wily, treacherous asp..."

"The word, serpent, comes from the Latin language. Serpent originates from _serpentis_ which means, 'something that creeps.'" Blaze looks up and laughs at Colee.

Radium looks up and winks at Colee. "You left something out of your lecture, Blaze. You forget to add a noxious creature that creeps, hisses, and stings..."

"A serpent is a malicious person. Yes! Right on!" Morton reads the last language definition of serpent and looks up, smiling at Colee. The other students laugh out loud and stare at Colee also.

Colee swiftly stands upright from the single bench seat at the end of the picnic table without taking her food plate, frowning with fighting fury while drooling out her wet mouth salvia over her parted lips. She stares at Morton.

Blaze looks down and starts to consume the food plate with a smile. "Bye, sweet-tart! I'll not miss your ugly face."

"Are you going to leave and go somewhere else, but here, dearest Colee?" Morton laughs with a wink at her.

Colee shuffles from the bench seats and waves both hands near her sneer, staring at Morton. "I am coming from here to there and behead your body from your neck muscles..."

"Sit down, Colee!" Preston looks up and sneers at Colee. Colee stops moving and stares at Preston in silence, slowly sitting back down on top of the single bench with a loud grunt of disappointment.

Blaze swallows the food and accesses the tiny keyboard on his phone with a smile. "Now, let each one of us look up the proper name Radium?"

Radium slaps his chest with a smile without accessing his personal mobile phone, scanning the table. "Radium is represented by the two letters, RA."

"No!" Blaze looks up and frowns, shaking his skull while understanding the scientific reference of the earth element radium.

"Yes!" Radium nods.

"Naw!" Blaze frowns.

"Yeah!" Radium smiles.

"Nope!" Blaze sneers.

"Yup!" Radium laughs.

Morton reads out loud from the tiny screen on his phone. "Earth mineral radium is a chemical element which is represented by the atomic number 88, the atomic weight 226 with a melting point of 1,292 degrees Fahrenheit and a boiling point of 2,084 degrees..."

"You're hot!" Barbie smiles at Radium.

"Thanks, muffin!" Radium bows his chin to Barbie as she giggles.

"... with a density of five grams-per-cubic centimeters and which is also a metal of radioactive." Morton looks up and smiles at his guy Radium.

"I'm radioactive, ya'll." Radium tosses both arms in the air with a laugh, slamming them back down, wrapping his arms around his guy Morton.

Morton continues to read out loud from the tiny screen on his phone to each pair of eardrums. "The chemical element radium was discovered by Marie Curie, a Polish chemist, and her husband Pierre Curie, a French chemist in the year 1898 from the earth mineral uranium. The name comes from the Latin word for ray or radius."

"Give us the finale, Morton!" Radium continues to hug his guy Morton and nods to each face around the table. Each face looks up from the screen on their mobile phone and stares at Morton and Radium.

Morton reads out loud from the tiny screen. "And the earth element radium is symbolized by the letters, RA."

Radium releases Morton and swiftly stands upright from the shared bench seat, pointing his face and arms to the bright yellow sun. "Right on, baby!" He looks down and then sits back down, cuddling with Morton, staring at each one of his friends.

"So what!" Colee frowns at Radium. "Letters R and A are two symbols within the English alphabet which is used by first graders to learn how to spell words and read sentences here at the NAS school."

"He was Ra." Blaze points with a laugh at Radium.

"He is Ra." Morton looks up and nods with a smile to each friend.

"He was the Greek god called Ra in Fifth dynasty in the country of Egypt." Blaze smiles.

"Was that a major god among the Egyptians?" Barbie frowns.

"I was the major supernatural being of all earthlings, muffin!" Radium nods.

"Ra was the ancient Egyptian sun god that was godly worshipped by every pharaoh king and queen and all of their royal subjects, not including the slaves." Morton nods.

Barbie looks down and types on the tiny keyboard reading out loud the new data from the screen. "The World History e-book says that you as sun god Ra had defeated your chief enemy, the serpent..."

She gasps in shock and looks up with confusion to see Radium. "But, we don't defeat the serpent. We all lost out when the serpent was defeated inside the Garden of Eden with that damn apple he gave to first born earth daughter Eve, who shared the forbidden fruit with her naked man Adam."

"A little white lie!" Radium laughs.

"A big black lie!" Blaze smiles.

"How did you think I got that big, bad godly reputation, muffin?" Radium nods to Barbie.

"From the planet of dumb humans." Morton laughs.

"From the town of stupid Egyptians." Blaze nods.

"From a smarter sun god Ra, that's me!" Radium slaps his chest with laughter. Morton leans over and hugs his fellow, touching his lips on the cheekbone on Radium with happiness.

"Not here, tots." Blaze shakes his bone skull and finishes the evening meal.

Morton pulls back with a smile and stares at Radium. "You did a good job taking care of all the dumb humans, my guy Radium."

"Right on! They're all gone with the sun now." Radium leans over and kisses the lips on Morton.

"Not here, tots!" Blaze frowns and then swallows the food.

Colee turns with a smile and points at cute two demon-guy couple. "Are you two demons gay?"

"Yes." Morton and Radium answer simultaneously.

Morton stands upright from the shared bench seat with his boyfriend Radium and slaps both hands over his clothing with a sour frown, staring at Colee. "Don't I look, act, and smell gay? Yes, of course, I do. Didn't you notice the fashionable, military-style designer fatigues, tee shirt, leather belt and my pair of matching dark blue alligator shoes? Why can't you tell, darling? Are your neurons dumb or numb, honey?"

Blaze finished the meal with a loud burp. "I can answer that one. Numb from the cold blood stirring inside her ice cold veins and the thick epidermis rippling ugly on her rough exterior hind, much like her namesake the slithering dirt-hugging cobra."

Colee hisses at Blaze and then sneers at Morton, "I didn't like being insulted here, nutty fruitcake and one more." She turns and moans to Preston, "Preston, come and do something bad here to these two..."

"Drink your teacup with the after dinner coffee, Cobra!" Preston leans over and kisses the forehead on Priam, pulling back with a smile, tickling her body as she wiggles and giggles with delight.

"Time to leave! Each one of us must vacant the picnic table and the heated evening weather. The time is 5:55 pm." Morton points at the sinking sun on the water horizon that glows in colors of reds, pinks, yellows, and blues.

Preston releases Priam and swiftly stands upright from their shared bench seat at the end of the table, leaning down, assisting her to stand. He cuddles her and tenderly kisses her lips, pulling back with a smile, smoothing her soft cheek with his two fingers. "Goodnight, lambie pie!"

"Preston!" Priam frowns with great disappointment, not wanting to leave his tall, warm body during the evening hours.

"Curfew, each angel and demon must honor the code, including Priam." Morton continues to stand in place and parks both of his fists on the designer belt, staring with worry at the rear hairy skull on Priam.

"Time to split!" Radium stands upright with a smile and reaches down, grabbing Morton's hand, scooting around the bench seat. He pulls both of them back towards the open doors on the H Building that houses both the angel and demon separate sleeping compartments during curfew.

"Bye, demons!" Blaze stands upright from the shared bench seat with his girl Barbie and scoots away from the dirty picnic table, where the birds and squirrels will steal all of the paper plates and remaining food items for their supper meal. They head back to the same set of open doors on the H Building behind the back spine on Morton and Radium.

In front of the picnic table, Preston leans down and whispers softly into her face with a smile. "Have a set of sweet dreams, lamb! I'll meet you back here at beachside at zero, six, zero, one in a new dawn, tomorrow morning." He leans over and hugs Priam, pulling back with a smile, kissing her parted lips.

She sniffs up a set of runny snot and wet tears of sadness, spinning around with Preston, slowly following the back spine on Blaze and Barbie,

A line of paired couples swiftly move ahead and enter through the open doorways, which close precisely at 06:00 pm every evening at the NAS Key West H Building.

Inside the busy hallway with people jogging side to side, running into each other's face, sometimes with an unfriendly sneer, Preston and Priam immediately part after the entrance way and quickly veer to the opposite side wall, moving ahead to their assigned sleeping compartment.

Priam reaches a second square shaped archway with a single metal door in dark green paint and spins around with a smile, catching a glance at the back spine on Preston.

On the opposite side wall, the single metal door in bright red paint is open. Preston follows last in line and looks back over his collar bone, smiling at his girl Priam.

Inside the open archway, Colee silently stands against the wide frame observing the dull skyline through the entrance archway disappearing into the darkness.

Preston slams into Colee with a loud grunt first and then scoots around her sideways body with a chuckle second, entering inside the assigned angel compartment for the nighttime hours during curfew.

Colee slowly rebounds and then stands upright, scooting back into the open archway of the Angel Lair compartment waving her final good bye to a sad lingering Priam inside the Demon Den as they both spin around and witness a pair of sliding steel doors close shut and then lock while caging all of them inside the H Building, precisely six pm, during Curfew.

Inside the common hallway, some of the adults, teens, and children slowly venture down the busy space and head towards their individual or family assigned sleeping compartments.

Radium and Morton stand together in the same hallway and kiss each other, pulling with a smile. Radium spins around with a grin and moves ahead, dancing around each child and their parents without his guy Morton, entering the Demon Den, disappearing down the busy corridor.

Demon Den location

06:02 p.m.

Mostly gray tinted clouds without sunlight

Air temperature 68F

Precipitation 98%

Northern winds at 15 mph

Morton continues to stand in the busy hallway and watches the back spine on his guy with a smile, turning to sneer at evil Colee inside the Angel Lair compartment and then spins around with a gasp. He accidentally bumps into a lingering Priam inside the Demon Den archway, reaching out and catches her by the arms, slowly scooting her back through the open archway and nods with a stern face. "I'm sorry, Priam. Curfew rules. You and I both know that." He stops and stands with her inside the internal common hallway that leads to each sleeping compartment as other demons with children scoot around them without a sneer or a smile.

Priam hugs Morton and nods with a sad face, wiping off the runny snot with one hand and the rolling tears with the other hand, "I know that too. I just wanna be with Preston each evening."

He cuddles her, like a motherly figure, pulling back with a smile, patting her collar bone with a nod. "I know that you know and I know too. Do you want me to illustrate a fairy tale story on your bedroom wall tonight? I can bring inside more sitting chairs and turn them into a table of knights or a circle of funny, silly clowns. You really liked the circus of clowns as a little tiny toddler."

She shakes her black colored curls. "Yes, I like your clown shows, but I have homework to finish tonight before the first period school session tomorrow morning."

"I can finish it for you," he smiles.

She exhales with disappointment. "No, I got it covered, Morton. Thank you."

"I would do anything for you, Priam. You tell or command me to do anything at all," he smiles. Morton had become her big brother inside the Demon Den while raising her from a small kid into a beautiful teenager.

"I know. You have made me feel better already just offering your clowns and your love, Morton." She expresses her semi-daughterly feelings toward her nightly babysitter.

"I've been taking care of you, since you were a little banshee. I didn't like to see you sad, Priam. Do you wanna talk about it? I'm a good listener." He inquires with a smile.

She shakes her curls. "No, I'm fine. I just miss Preston, when we part at Curfew. That's all. It makes me sad."

"Curfew requires both the Den of cool demons and the Lair of pretty angels to separate ..."

"Morton, do you know personally, if a cool demon and a handsome angel has ever gotten together and lived inside a central den or house or place during Curfew?" She nods.

He shakes his skull with a smile. "I have never heard of that happening. Curfew is..."

She tosses her arms in the air with a sour frown. "I know. I know that," she drops down of her hands and slaps his collar bone with a smile. "Thanks for cheering me up, Morton." She spins around from her friend with a deep sigh of sadness, slumping down both of her shoulders, slowly moving ahead down the common hallway toward her private room.

Morton continues to stand with sadness and observe Priam in silence worry.

Priam continues to slowly move down a busy hallway, where thirty-five other happy demons reside inside the Demon Den and prepare for the nightly ritual consisting of bath time and then bed time, after reading a story to each one of their demon kids as a shared family activity.

Priam turns the wall corner and passes a slightly cracked open metal door that leads into a common green painted interior playground area that contains tiny equipment pieces for young children, consisting of a tiny silver tinted slide, a row of three red tinted tiny metal swings, a tiny set of silver tinted monkey bars, a wall of televisions for recorded cartoon and educational programs, and a set of scattered tiny blue colored eating plastic tables with four tiny matching chairs.

Priam hears a set of clear voices from a young adult female demon who is reading out loud a fun child's story with two little banshees. She stops with a smile and stands behind the vertical tiny crack between the vanilla colored solid wall and the red colored metal door frame, spying on the three individuals while ease dropping on their conversation.

One individual is a tiny child female with a head of red hair, a bright smile, and a tone of pale skin, sitting on the floor, staring up at the young adult demon. Beside the tiny female demon, a small male demon child wears a head of brown colored hair, a sneer, and a tone of dark skin, wiggling side to side while staring up at the same young adult demon.

The young adult demon displays a head of blonde hair, a tone of dark skin, and a stern face, looking down at each young child or banshee. Inside the playground room, sitting in one of the tiny chair, the young adult demon shakes her curls with a firm tone. "That's not right, sweetie."

"I am not to hold the hand of an angel," the female banshee nods with a stern face.

"This is not right, sweetie," the adult frowns.

"Why not, Miss Oreed?" The female banshee frowns.

"When an angel and a demon touch with their hands, they both die. Poof!" Miss Oreed nods with a stern face.

"No die, not me!" the child male banshee shakes his brown colored skull and slaps his chest. "No touch angel. Bad! Bad! Bad!"

"You don't understand, sweetie." Oreed nods.

"I don't understand. What do I not understand, Miss Oreed?" The female banshee frowns.

"It is okay to touch the hand of an angel during the day light time, starting at six o'clock in the morning." She nods.

"Six..." the female banshee does not understand as she is only six years old.

"Six o'clock is the time," the male banshee leans over and points at his wrist watch. "Do you see my watch on my wrist?"

The female banshee turns and smiles down at the watch. "Yeah!"

"What number is that?" Oreed asks.

"Six," the male banshee answers.

"When the big hand is here at the number twelve and little hand is located on the bottom of the wrist watch at the number six, you can touch the hand of an angel during the daylights hours." Oreed smiles.

"No touch! They stink," the male banshee sneers.

"The sweet smell is a good odor to each human, which smells a garden vine of honeysuckles." Oreed nods.

"We smell good like a coco bean," the male banshee lifts up and smells his arm, laughing out loud.

"Do I smell too?" The female banshee nods.

"Yes, sweetie, we all smell good." Oreed grins.

The male banshee leans over and slaps the naked arm on the female banshee, growing out loud, "Naw! You stink really, really baddie, to me, to me, to me..."

"Be nice, Darrail!" Oreed frowns at the child demon and his demon bad behavior.

Darrail slaps his chest with a snarl at Oreed. "I like to be mean. I'm a demon. I'm going to become the king of the demons someday."

The female banshee turns and gasps at the nose profile on Darrail. "No! Not true!"

He turns and snarls the female banshee. "Yup! Yeah! Me! I am and I tell you what to do!"

"Please, explain to me! What do you mean by the term 'king of the demons,' Darrail?" Oreed gasps in alarm at the statement from the child demon.

He slaps his chest with a nod and a sneer. "My mom tells me that the demons don't die. They reign on Earth..."

"Demons do not rule here on the planet, Darrail." Oreed shakes her black colored curls.

"My mom says, to me, that the demons will come back and then rule everything, after we go and beat up those nasty angels in the big War." He sneers.

Oreed exhales with a deep sigh, "I respect your mother, Darrail. However, a war is not good for the gang of demons or the flock of angels. I would like for you to remember that big event."

"I like war and beating up things in war," he growls with a nod.

"I like you, Miss Oreed," the female banshee turns and smiles at her nice teacher.

"Thank you, sweetie!" Oreed turns and smiles at the female banshee, returning back to see the male banshee. "Darrail let us be clear here with my words. A war is not coming with any of the flock of angels."

He nods with a laugh, "My mom says, to me, that after war, there will be no more Curfew hours for any of the demons, like me and her."

"Well, young banshee, that's a very new and different demon tale," Oreed softly chuckles. Her mobile telephone softly rings with a classical song on top of the eating table. She answers the phone with a smile. "Hello."

Pause.

"Yes, ma'am." She nods with a smile at the familiar female voice on the other end of the phone and then disconnects the call, holding her phone in one hand while staring down at the two demon children. "Children, it is time to go back home."

"Yes ma'am!" The female banshee swiftly stands and dances in place with a smile of happiness.

Darrail swiftly stands up from the floor and spins around, stomping ahead toward the archway.

Oreed stands upright from the tiny chair and leans over hugging the female child, watching the back spine on Darrail. "Darrail, stop and wait for me! Sweetie, do you know how to play follow the leader?" She asks the female banshee. Darrail stops a few feet from the partially closed door.

"Uh, huh!" The female banshee continues to dance in place with giggles.

Oreed nods. "Okay. Go and follow behind Darrail down the long hallway, until you see your mommy at the opening of your den home. Okay, sweetie?"

"Okay!" The female Banshee skips ahead with a smile and then slams into the back spine on Darrail with a giggle, back stepping with a hiss of fun.

Darrail swiftly shuffles forward from his upright pose and catches his tiny body, spinning around with a hiss, leaning into her face with a sneer.

Oreed swiftly moves ahead from the table and then separates the two tiny bodies, leaning down, grabbing an individual hand from each child. She places the two individual hands together with a smile and a firm tone. "Take her hand, Darrail! And do not lose her, until she is holding her mommy's hand at her demon home!"

The female banshee wiggles side to side but continues to hold his hand. "Is he an angel, Miss Oreed?"

He leans over and hisses into her face. "No, ya ugly demon!"

Oreed releases their hand and shoves open the door. Priam quickly back steps from the crack as the door nosily creaks open, exposing a four year old black headed little girl and a brown haired seven years old demon boy. Oreed reaches down and scoots the two banshees out the open archway with a firm tone. "Do not talk rudely like that to your friend, Darrail! No, sweetie. Darrail is all demon-boy. I promise," Oreed softly giggles.

"Okay," the female banshee moves ahead and pulls the hand on Darrail. They exit the room and slowly move down an empty hallway hand-in-hand while pushing and shoving each other.

Priam softly chuckles at the two young demons and then turns with a smile to see the adult demon. "Hey, Oreed!"

"Hi, Priam!" Oreed smiles and watches the two little banshees.

"Are you stuck babysitting again during the dinner meal?" Priam returns back and watches the two little banshees with a grin.

"Yes, I provide a dinner time story time with them while their parents enjoy some peace and harmony during the meal as part of my internship program."

"That's so nice! They so really cute and precious." Priam watches the cute banshees, disappearing around corner.

"This young breed of demons is very slick and clever. They don't miss a thing between their parents and their teachers. One of the kids told me that a gang of demons will come back and rule the world, after the war. Have you ever heard such a demon tale within your continuous eternal existence?" She turns and shakes her curls with a smile at Priam.

"No." Priam frowns at the empty hallway.

"Well, there's the first time for a demon tale. I guess." She exits the room with a laugh and slowly moves into the empty hallway, heading back to her sleep compartment suite.

Priam ponders the information with a smile. "Could the new demon tale be true, Oreed?"

Oreed shrugs a shoulder at the posed question and exits from the playground room, slowly moving down an empty hallway, saying out loud. "His mom is one of the more powerful demons here inside the Demon Den."

She gasps in shock and nods at the back spine on Oreed. "Then, then maybe, his mom could be right about the rule of demons on this planet."

Oreed continues to move down the hallway. "Well, his mom is always right about most of the ancient texts and fables, since I also work with her nasty person inside the demon library here during my internship, until I am assigned a new demon job. His mom is acknowledgeable about numerous concepts of celestial stuff and all of the ancient demon lore."

Priam slowly moves ahead with a smile and follows the back spine on Oreed, waving both of her arms with a nod. "Well, I am. Are you interested in finding out more secret information about the ancient and mysterious demon lore?" Oreed carries secret knowledge and can access tons of data about facts and fictions regarding the demon clan which is not taught here at the human academic school to either humans or angels or demons.

Oreed stops with a gasp on top of the hallway floor and spins around with a stern face to Priam. "Well, I guess so."

She claps with a nod. "Great! Where do we start?"

Oreed spins back around and waves her hand in the air to Priam, moving ahead down an empty hallway towards a side wall of closed metal doors in different tints. "We can start in her office as I'm only a studying intern. The side wall holds an array of office rooms for various reasons. She has an electronic reading devise inside her office. We can use her electronic devise and read searching for war between the angels and the demons." She continues to stomp loudly towards the middle space on the side wall and stop, opening the door, entering into a large peach colored office with a set of regular office furniture items without closing the door. She halts beside a tan colored office desk filled with stacks of papers, reaching out, grabbing a hand-held device and presses the button. The surface screen on the machine blinks into yellow light and displays rows of numerous electronic data with tiny numbers and alphabetic letters. She continues to type on the attached tiny keyboard with a smile.

From the empty hallway, Priam enters the room and stops a few feet from the open archway, smiling at the new pretty room. "Wow! This room is so large and pretty in peach tint."

She continues to type and read each page with a stern face while standing. "She likes the color of peach which is strange for a demon."

Priam moves ahead to the office desk and scans the stack of papers, seeing the reading devise in the hands of Oreed. "That's so nice too! Do you happen to possess a second electronic reading devise also?" She pulls out one of the front metal chairs and sits down, scanning the devise.

"There is a second electronic reading devise over there by her business computer."

Priam reaches over and carefully grabs the heavy device, drawing into her face, typing on the tiny keyboard. The devise activates with sound, lights, and data also. "What page are you reading?" She stops and scans the tiny screen with new information.

"I don't know what page number all of the ancient demon lore stuff really starts on. I am just typing and reading from page one." She continues to type and then reads in silence the new information on the tiny screen.

Priam stares down at the page of new information with a deep sigh of frustration, "There appears to be lots and lots of words and sections and sections of little pages here."

She continues to type and then reads in silence. "Each devise holds 850,000 electronic tiny books inside the memory banks with an average length of 100,000 English words. That's over 85 billion words, so get reading."

"Wow! We'll be reading in here all night." Priam continues to type and rapidly read each screen with a stern face. A few minutes later, she smiles. "I found it."

Oreed looks up with a gasp and stares down at the hair roots on Priam. "Found what? What did you find in there?"

She reads out loud from the selected page on the tiny screen. "It says right here, if an angel and a demon touch a hand or any other body part during the Curfew hours of probation, then both life forms will disintegrate." She gasps in shock and looks up with a frown to see Oreed. "What on Earth? Do you believe that nonsense here, Oreed?"

Oreed frowns. "We decided to research the war between a set of demons and a group of angels, not Curfew concept, Priam. Anyways, every demon and angel learns that about ancient and nasty axiom from birth. That's definitely some wicked demon lore there," she laughs alone.

On top of the chair, Priam looks down and continues to read out loud from devise machine. "Also, it says here that each angel and demons cannot leave the Earth plane but can exist between heaven and hell, without recourse. What does that mean, Oreed?"

Oreed clears her throat with a sour frown, staring down at black colored hair roots. "Well, we aren't supposed to be researching the concept of Curfew. But, based on those few statements, I'd translate here for you, the group of angels and the set of demons are really a set of immortals that walk around here on Planet Earth living out their live like a human, but not a human foreverly in time."

She looks up with a nod. "I agree with your statement, Oreed. The next passage is kinda crazy. Punishment of Curfew is determined by...." She leans down and frowns at the words on the screen, "I can't really see the next sentence of words clearly. It reads: They cometh."

"To continue that ancient and nasty axiom, if an angel or a demon dares to defile Curfew by standing alone outside in the weather element without the protective steel curtains on each glass window or the steel plate in front of the entrance door. They come!"

"Who comes?" Priam gasps in alarm.

Oreed shakes her curls with a frown. "I do not know the 'they' part from that nasty and ancient axiom. But, as a young child, like you, I had been reminded over and over and over again, if I wasn't inside the protection shelter, before six pm, then they come."

"Who comes?" She frowns.

"I guess the 'they' part is the awarder of a deadly punishment on any demon that stands outside in the weather elements..."

She nods. "Yeah, yeah, I've heard that ancient and nasty saying for centuries and centuries and centuries, too. But, who are they? Do you believe any of this demon lore nonsense, Oreed?"

Oreed exhales with a stern face. "Yes, I do."

She frowns. "What about the part about a demon touching an angel during Curfew?"

Oreed narrows her eyelashes at Priam and sneers with worry. "I don't rightly know of a paired couple consisting of a demon and an angel that has touched their hands or a body part during Curfew, Priam. Why are you inquiring here?"

"Who should or could or shall we consult about that ancient and nasty axiom?" She smiles.

"What are you saying, girlfriend? We will consult no one about that ancient and nasty axiom. And we do not tell anyone about us researching this stuff on Curfew, either," Oreed swiftly reaches out and grabs the second device from Priam, cuddling both of them into her chest, sneering at the young demon, "Or you and I might get into major demon trouble, Priam. You obey Curfew. Or they come!"

Priam exhales with annoyance. "This is an unproven piece of ancient demon lore even here within the current century, Oreed."

Oreed places the two borrowed devises back down on top of the office desk and points with a growl at Priam. "You are a demon, Priam. You have been warned numerous times about touching an angel during Curfew. Or you will die! The end!"

She rolls her eyeballs and returns back with a smile to see Oreed. "First daughter Eve was told too same information while living here on Planet Earth. If she reached out and touched that juicy looking apple fruit, then she would die."

"And the Earth story continues that first human daughter Eve ate from the forbidden fruit which was plucked down from the Tree of Knowledge, not Tree of Life."

She frowns. "What's the difference between the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life?"

"No one can eat from the Tree of Life within the Garden of Eden. That means no one lives after eating the forbidden fruit, Priam. And both demons and angels possess the knowledge of good and evil. Angels are good. Demons are evil."

"Wrong, demon girlfriend!" Priam hisses with alarm at the demon adult.

"The group of demons tends to be really funner and happens to do lots of wicked stuff too," she laughs with an evil tone.

"All of us are not wicked, Oreed."

She winks with a wicked grin. "And some of us are not good either, Priam."

Priam frowns. "The point here to remember: angels and demons live together forever, whether good or bad and touching or not."

"Well, I don't wanna ever test out that deadly working theory, Priam?" She moves ahead towards the open archway.

"What deadly working theory? That doesn't make any sense! Aren't you curious about Curfew and the touching concept, Oreed?" Priam follows her across the room.

She exits the room and shouts out loud with worry. "No! Why are you curious about Curfew and the touching concept, Priam? What are you hinting at or hunting for?"

Priam halts inside the open archway and stares at the back spine on Oreed. "I am not hunting, but debating with you, Oreed. That's all!" She nods with a smile.

Oreed stops and spins around, sneering at Priam. "Well, save your debating techniques for the academic classroom, Priam." She spins around with a sneer and nosily stomps down the empty hallway, disappearing around the wall corner.

She exhales with annoyance and slowly moves ahead without shutting the office door, strolling towards her own sleeping compartment in pink colors that had been selected by her fatherly figure Morton here with another lonely night of Curfew without Preston and with her wild mental thoughts in silence.

Each student emerges from a family or individual sleep compartment with a smile and slowly strolls among the numerous bodies, heading down the aisle with numerous academic classrooms for day of school.

Inside the same academic hallway, Morton swings his hand happily back and forth with Radium's hand enjoying the new day with a smile. Blaze struts ahead with a sneer and bursts them apart using his body, shouting out loud, shaking his bone skull, "Not here, tots." Barbie follows behind her man and leads their set of friends into the wheat colored classroom with three walls of solid paint and one wall holds a row of long and tall exposed glass windows that displays the vast and deep Gulf of Mexico waters in dark blue hue over the eastern horizon of pink, red, yellow, and orange tones.

Each student returns back to the same assigned unique student desk of colorful metal with a silly design, sitting down, making lots of noise.

In front of the classroom behind the white writing board, Miss R stands with a smile and does not hold her computer table. "Good morning, students! We will be discussing in greater detail your individual new term project for any event, past or present, here within this world, not another planet within the solar system which is your required World History assignment and is due in two weeks."

"Boo!" the student yells out loud from the school desk at the teacher.

"Hiss!" A second student screams out loud from their school desk at the teacher too.

"Yay!" A third student hollers out loud from their school desk at the teacher also.

An array of flying fist-sized, wet, and multi-colored paper balls elegantly twirl through the air from numerous open mouths and then deftly land on top of the empty teacher desk of smooth wood next to her arm on Miss R. She reaches down and swipes each wet spit ball from her desk and stares at the students with a sour frown. "The number five plus the number five equal ten days of school including your precious weekend which all equals..."

"We can count." Blaze sits in the second row in the middle of the desks and shouts out loud with a sneer at teacher.

"... up to four," Morton turns with a smile and jabs a finger at each one of his friends with a head nod, pointing at Radium, Priam, Preston, and then his chest, laughing out loud. "One. Two. Three. Four."

"Shut up, moron!" Colee sits in the second row behind Blaze which is far away from Radium and closer to Morton. Radium turns and hisses at her. She turns and smiles sweetly back at Radium.

"Morton." Morton stares at the teacher and smiles with his proper name.

In front of the classroom, Miss R yells out loud for attention. "To make this project fair for everyone, there will be a coupling of teams. Two students will exist on a team and work together to complete the assignment or face the letter grade of F for failure from me."

"Boo!" the student yells out loud from the school desk at the teacher.

"Hiss!" A second student screams out loud from their school desk at the teacher too.

"Yay!" A third student hollers out loud from their school desk at the teacher also.

Miss R strolls ahead to the first column of school desks, offering an upside down brown colored fedora to first student, saying with a smile. "Pick one slip of paper and then get up from your chair, handing to the odd-numbered student in your row, passing the upside down hat around the room. Then the person in the last row near the closed door, please return an empty fedora back to me."

The first student accepts the upside down fedora and drops a hand down into the soft interior, grabbing one slip of white colored paper, passing the hat to the second student.

"No!" Miss R frowns at Radium. "Radium, do not take out a sliver of paper from the upside down fedora. Please, by-pass your person and pass the hat to Preston. Preston is the fifth person in your row. Only the odd-numbered school desk with a student gets to pick out a sliver of paper," she watches in silence.

In the second rows of student desks, Morton occupies the fourth chair which is not beside his boyfriend Radium, gasping in alarm. Based the current hat-passing process, the hat will by-pass an even-numbered seat with a student, thus Morton will not be able to work closely with Radium on the shared class assignment. So, he sits upright from his chair and then quickly slides down into the first chair, an odd-numbered seat, turning with a wink to see the nose profile on Radium.

In the second school desk, Radium tosses the hat in the air with his demon magic and an evil laugh. The hat sails over his red colored buzz cut and falls down through the air towards Preston.

Preston does not reach out for the hat and waves his hand side to side in the air, tossing out his angel magic, turning to wink at his girl Priam. She sits in the third seat on the second row and will select his name from the hat. So, the hat sails over his blonde hair roots and lands down in the open palms on Blaze and as Preston uses his angel magic to blind the eyeballs of the human teacher.

Blaze sits in the fifth student desk in the same row with Preston and accepts the hat with a smile, reaching down, pulling out a sliver of paper with an evil laugh. He tosses the upside down fedora in the air using his angel magic and launches towards the second row of school desks at Colee.

On the second row of school desks, in the seventh seat, Colee catches the hat and grabs a sliver of paper with a sour frown, tossing the hat in the air with her angel magic, sending it to Barbie, who sits in the fifth seat on the second row. Colee looks down and gasps in shock, looking up with an evil laugh, staring at the teacher.

In the fifth school desk, Barbie catches the hat with her demon magic and selects a sliver of paper for some tormenting human fun, tossing the hat in the air, sending the hat to Priam in the third chair. The hat soars through the air waves and then drops down, landing inside the open palms on Morton, who sits in the first school desk.

Morton had used his demon magic and by-passed Priam in the third chair.

In the second chair, on the first row, Preston turns and sneers at the nose profile on Morton. Now, Preston and his girl Priam do not possess a sliver of paper with neither one of their printed names. He leans over with a growl to snatch the sliver of paper from Morton and replace the name with Priam's, so she and he can work together on the shared school project.

On top of the teacher desk, Miss R gasps in shock and jabs a finger at Morton. "What's going on here? What's happening there in the second row? Where is that hat? I don't see the hat."

Preston continues to lean over and sneers at Morton for messing up the magical process with Priam and the class project.

"Nothing!" Morton lifts up the hat with a laugh and then drops it down on top of the hard surface, pulling out a sliver of paper from the hat with a smile and leans over, handing the upside down fedora to the first student on the third row with an evil laugh.

Preston sits upright and gasps in alarm, turning to see Priam with worry. She wiggles side to side in her chair, scanning the room with nervousness. She does not possess a sliver of paper with Preston's name. Hopefully, Morton had performed his demon magic to possess a sliver of paper with her name. She can work with Morton on the shared school project this week.

Inside the room, on each row, each odd-numbered seat with a student grabs a sliver of paper. On the last row, in the first student desk, the upside down fedora hat becomes empty and then come back to the teacher. The student returns back to their chair. Miss R places the empty fedora over her hair roots and claps with a smile for attention. "Every odd-numbered seat has a sliver of paper. This is how the process works. Barbie, please read out loud to me your picked out slip of paper with the name of our future school buddy partner for your shared history assignment." Her eyeballs and the rest of the human eyeballs have been blinded by Barbie's angel magic.

On the second row, in the fourth chair, Barbie looks down at the paper with a smile. "My slip of paper reads the proper name: Preston."

On top of the desk, Miss R nods with a grin to Barbie and Preston. "Excellent! Preston and Barbie will work together on the World History project and then both will present the report and the model two weeks from today. Does everyone understand the simple process of the partner selection and partner completion project?"

"I want Radium's name as my school buddy partner, Miss R." Morton looks down and silently reads the name on his silver of paper, which is not Radium, but a human female.

On top of the teacher desk, Miss R shakes her skull with a firm tone, "No, Morton. This is a new learning and social engagement in order to meet and greet a different set of students here within our shared classroom."

Morton looks up with a sad face and whines to the teacher. "I don't wanna meet a different student here within our shared classroom."

"Hush, Morton!" Miss R frowns. "Now, each one of you understands the simple concept. Go and find your selected classroom partner and start thinking about your new World History project. I'm going to the office for a brief meeting with the principal which will take a couple of hours. Then I will dismiss the school session for the day, so you can meet and greet each other with your new buddy work assignment." She stands and exits the room, slamming the door shut.

Inside the classroom, teen Dolly slides off the seat on the fourth row with a smile and slowly moves to the second row of student desks. "Priam, I got your name from the hat," she stops at the nose profile on Priam and drops down her slip of paper on top of the hard surface. "Do you see here on the tiny sliver of paper? You are my mystery history buddy for our shared class project."

Inside the chair, Priam looks up and shakes her curls at Dolly. "I'll not really smart about history, Dolly. You might want to ask Miss R, if you could switch with another studious student in order to receive a better grade in World History." She turns with worry and stares at Preston.

On the first row, Preston slides off the chair and stares at Priam in silence worry.

Blaze scoots from his chair with a grin and moves around the room with soft chuckles, searching for the name of the human while staring his torment procedure for his fun and the human's misery.

On the second row of student desks, Dolly continues to stand and slaps her chest with a smile at Priam. "Well, you're a lucky girl. I'm smart. I did one of those world history projects, last year. No sweat! We can use my historical topic and adjust all the materials with a different date, names and other references for our new assignment. I promise you'll get a good grade." She chuckles.

"I guess. It just seems useless to do the same thing over and over again." Priam continues to sit in the desk and stares down at her two naked palms without a sliver of paper with Preston's name.

"I agree." Morton continues to sit and frowns down at the sliver of paper with a human male's name, not his boyfriend Radium, exhaling with annoyance at his lousy demon powers. "Over and over again is boring." He has attended a human high school session as an ancient demon for thousands of centuries, since the first cave man had started talking with grunted sounds and then invented a pile of fire, burning off one of his private parts.

Dolly smiles and slaps the hard surface on Priam's desk. "Why don't you come over to my house, Priam? We can get a jump start on the outline and research some major details before our dinner meal?"

Priam turns and stares with worry at Preston, "Well..."

She nods. "It's okay. My father is the big man on campus."

Preston stands beside the first row of student desks in front of the row of glass windows and stares at human girl Dolly with a stern face of concern. "Are your father and mother located at your house, right now, Dolly?"

Dolly looks up and smiles at Preston. "No, my father is at work. He is right now walking around here somewhere inspecting all military troops and all the buildings and other stuff."

"Where is your biological mother?" Preston personally inquires.

"Dead."

"I am sorry," he nods.

"My mom has been gone a long time," she exhales with sadness and then smiles. "But I'm home alone now with tons of delicious food items and school books for our shared class project."

"I don't know." Priam stares at Preston.

Preston waves a hand with his angel magic as the stationary row of student desks magically part for his footpath, moving ahead to Priam and then stops. He leans down and pulls Priam from the seat, cuddling her into chest, whispering into her face. "This is okay with me. You must complete each one of our homework assignments even with a human, Priam." Each demon's part of living inside the Demon Den is following each one of the set demon rules, such like, attending school or getting marriage or leaving, permanently, the nice shelter from the earth elements.

Priam can't leave the Demon Den and can't be protected, without Preston. And Preston can't leave the Angel Lair for an obvious reason.

"Can't I...?" Priam pulls away from his chest with a sad face and pouts with a soft whine to his face. "Can't you change this for me right now to work on our school project with you? You could ask Barbie to...?"

"No, Priam!" Preston hugs her and stares with a sneer at Barbie.

Barbie slides off her seat and stands with a gasp in alarm at Preston. She had used her angel magic and changed her slip of paper from the hat to Preston's name for her fun amusement.

However, Preston is the stronger angel here and then could have changed Priam's slip of paper into his name and rewritten a new name on Barbie's slip of paper also, until Morton had captured the flying fedora from Priam. Morton had not used his demon magic to rewrite Priam or Radium's name on the sheet of paper, but kept the name of a human female.

Preston exhales with worry and calms down his killer emotion, releasing Priam, looking down with a fake smile and whispers into her sad face, "You can go with Dolly. She is harmless. Run along and work on the project at her house for the rest of the daylight hours. Her home is safe for you, also. Then I will see you back here to share our dinner meal, right before Curfew."

Priam nods with a smile and back steps from Preston, slowly moving backwards around the rows of student desks, across the class room while bumping into other students and finally exits the room, seeing Preston's face. She spins around inside an empty hallway of vanilla paint and strolls with her buddy Dolly, who talks all the time about varied subject and leads to her vehicle.

Inside the classroom, Morton slides off the seat and exhales with annoyance, staring down at the sliver of paper with the human's name, hearing the sound of soft laughter. He looks up with a sneer and spins around, reading the mental mind on the evil angel. "Cobra!" He gasps in alarm. Radium scoots out from his chair and races around the desks, standing beside Morton, sneering at Colee, after reading her ugly facial expressions and her evil mental mind also.

Colee slides off her seat on the second row and stands upright with a wink to Morton, slowly moving ahead and around Barbie, laughing with an evil tone. She really had pulled his proper name from the hat without her angel magic.

Radium slides sideways with a sneer and blocks Morton from Colee. "How did Cobra get your name, baby?"

Morton glides sideways and stands beside Radium, reaching out, patting his chest with a smile at Colee. "There, there Radium! I can handle Cobra. Her hiss is worse than her bite." He chuckles with the others.

"My name is Colee." She stops a few feet from the two demons with a sneer.

Morton jabs a finger at Colee with a smile. "Good! She knows her name. So, she can do the preparing, writing, typing, drawing, presenting, and displaying for our visual homework assignment. Then she and I will get the academic letter grade of A, in which, I will magical change into the letter of F for us." He chuckles.

"F." Colee gasps in shock.

"F for fool!" Barbie stands in place and laughs at the back spine on Colee.

"Why are you giving your person the letter grade of F, Morton?" Preston frowns at Morton.

"I like to fall and fell and fail each one of my academic classes, so I can keep coming back to the base." Morton slaps his chest with a nod and laughs with the other teens.

Colee scans the room with a sour frown and returns back to see Morton, shaking her curls. "You like coming back to this. I don't get it! I didn't like this. I didn't like any of this."

Morton smiles with a nod. "I gotta uphold my academic reputation of a high school delinquent with my zero point zero grade point average, like now, baby."

"I'm impressed, Morton." Barbie laughs with a nod.

Radium lifts up and shakes his folded fist in the air at Colee and as her sliver of paper leaps out from her folded hand, landing down onto his open palm. He starts a tiny fire with his demon powers burning the sliver of paper inside his open palm without pain, only pleasure while sneering at Colee.

"You're impossible, moron!" Colee moves ahead with a sigh and exits the classroom, looking for another human to torment for her fun activity during the daylight hours before Curfew.

"Morton." Morton yells out loud his proper name and performs a fist bump with Radium while each one laughs out loud at Colee.

Dolly's residential house

12:32 p.m.

Sunny weather

Air temperature 89˚F

Precipitation 04%

Humidity 66%

Southern winds at 06 mph

Inside the supplied military four-door sedan, Priam uncomfortably rides in the rear passenger bench with her new classmate Dolly in silence, staring through the side glass window at the familiar landscape of white sands and rows of palm trees while speeding towards the human's residential home for the afternoon. A pastel baby blue cement two-story framed house displays a white tinted wooden wrap-around-balcony and lovely crossed-framed window panes which is a typical Key West residential home along the city island streets.

The sedan stops and releases the teens from the interior of the vehicle as they move into the house.

Inside the foyer lobby, Priam cautiously paces behind Dolly trotting pass the walls of dark colored wooden kitchen cabinets then the four-walled enclosed peach colored dining room, a large lavender colored living room while moving straight ahead down a narrow vanilla colored hallway into Dolly's private bedroom.

Inside Dolly's bedroom, the floor contains a white carpet and standard bedroom furniture, a four-poster bed frame, two matching light colored wooden dressing chests and a nine-drawer armoire with a green tinted metal student desk on one side wall containing a closed black colored laptop and a matching metal chair. On the opposite space from the entrance wall stands a ceiling-to-floor wall with themed toy dolls.

Priam slowly moves through the open archway with a smile and scans the pale green painted bedroom. "Wow! Your doll collection is impressive, Dolly." She stops and stands at the opposite wall without window, looking up and down with a grin, reaching out. I lift up a sealed box of Christmas Barbie with the blue sparkling glam party dress and a matching fake sapphire necklace. She replaces that box and reaches out, lifting up the next sealed box with a beach Barbie in skimpy pink colored bikini with a matching pink umbrella. "Why are they all enclosed in their individual boxes?" She replaces the box and scans the rest of wall of dolls. "None of them are opened, only displayed." She lifts up the next sealed box with a cowgirl Barbie holding a tiny black colored pistol and a yellow colored cowboy hat with a matching cowgirl outfit.

"That was my mom's idea." Dolly stops with a smile and stands beside the green tinted metal student desk, fiddling with a short stacks of reference books and a tiny sheet of loose papers, looking for the materials with the class assignment. "Each sealed box is a collector's item along with untouched toy doll. I plan to sale the entire collection and buy a car when I become eighteen years old."

"What about your future plans for college?" Priam smiles with her clever question. A human usually graduates the high school environment and then attends a post-educational institution unlike a demon or an angel.

"I'm a naval babe. The money for college is all cleared and covered for me. My dad won't get me an older or new car, until I graduate from college." She retrieves a stack of books and spins around with a frown, moving toward the wall of toy dolls and the back spine on Priam.

"That's sucks!" Priam laughs at the silly human, where Priam is a demon and does not attend college or any other type of human activity, but engages with other demons and her boyfriend Preston.

She stops and laughs with Priam. "Yeah! Big time! You know I might give one to Barbie." Dolly reaches down and lifts up one of the sealed boxes that displays a toy doll with a head of long brown colored hair and a pink tinted short party dress, smiling at item.

Priam frowns at the seal box with the doll. "Barbie! Are speaking about my friend Barbie from our school?"

"Yeah," she nods with a smile and gently shakes the sealed box to Priam. "How about this Barbie doll?"

Priam shakes her black tinted curls. "That's not a good idea, Dolly. She is the first Barbie. She does not like any type of imitations." She reaches down and lifts up a new sealed box admiring the tiny plastic fingers on the toy doll. The tiny doll reminds Priam of herself as a tiny girl that lives inside the Demon Den with Morton when she had played with different types of dolls, including a toy Barbie doll as a small child.

Dolly frowns down at the doll. "Imitations, what does that mean? I don't understand, Priam. Barbie is a toy doll. The first toy doll was created in 1950's."

She replaces the sealed box and reaches out, lifting up the next sealed box holding a male toy doll Ken near her smile, pointing at the box with a wink. "Barbie doesn't want a doll. She only wants a dude." She replaces the male doll and giggles along with Dolly.

Dolly replaces the female toy doll and nods with a smile. "O! I get it. Blaze, isn't that his name and her boyfriend?"

"I serve Barbie." Priam looks up and says in a perfect timber like Blaze's natural tenor voice to Dolly.

She laughs. "Ich dien Barbie. Did I get it right?"

Priam reaches out and performs a fist bump with Dolly, nodding with a smile "Way to go, girlfriend!"

"Thanks! I'm observant. I noticed that Blaze and Barbie are a couple along with you and Preston. Preston is really hot by the way."

"Taken, girlfriend!" Priam wiggles a finger at Dolly with a lady growl of playfulness. A human cannot ever mate or date an angel or a demon, so Prima is not jealous but teases the silly female teen for fun.

Dolly laughs with a nod. "Understood! But he's still hot."

She smiles. "Morton and Radium are together. They're a perfect couple for each other."

"That's cool. I like those two guys. Radium still has a hot bod to me. And Morton is really funny."

"Morton is really sweet and kind. He watches over..." Priam starts and then stops while almost spilling the secrets of the living gang of demons and angels at the H Building to the nosy human.

"Watches what? What does he watch?" Dolly asks.

"Colee is available at the moment. Do you know any cute guys, Dolly?" Priam quickly changes the subject with a smirk. Maybe, if Colee finds herself a descent boyfriend, then she'll be nicer to everyone and stop drooling over Preston.

Dolly laughs. "Palmer is available at the moment."

"Very good point Dolly! We should match-make with them."

She nods. "They might be a funny couple..."

"...and a fun couple..." Priam laughs.

"That's a good idea! You're really are a fun person, Priam. There's not many girls that my father allows over to my house. Maybe, you can come over more often."

"Yeah, maybe, I cannot." Priam whispers for her eardrums only.

She frowns. "O! Preston, right?" Priam nods in silence. Dolly smiles. "He really loves you. It's cute seeing both of you together like a pair of purring kittens."

"Thanks!" Priam smiles.

"Well, I understand, Priam. If I had a hot guy like Preston, then I'd been happy spending all my spare time with him too. I mean 24 hours, seven days per week, 365 days in the year..."

"...twenty-four hours, seven days per week, 365 days in the year..." Priam repeats with a different purpose.

She spins around from the wall of toy dolls and moves ahead, pointing down in the middle of the white colored carpet, sitting down with the stack of book. "Okay! It's time to start our outline. I did my last year's World History project on the marching journey of Alexander the Great towards the country of Asia, where he didn't reach or survive to see. But we can select another one of his adventures." Dolly flips open the history book and points down to the new page. "How about this adventure?"

Priam spins away from the wall of toy dolls and moves ahead, sitting on the opposite side of Dolly, looking down at the book.

Dolly stands upright from the floor with a smile. "I'll go and get two plates of food. We can eat our lunch in my room while reading through my handwritten notes and all the school textbooks and the reference books for our shared World History project. You can start looking for one of Alexander the Great marches. Do you like tuna fish, Priam?"

Yeah!" She exhales with a sigh of missing Preston and stares down at the school textbook with a sadness.

Dolly exits the room with a smile.

Five hours later, Dolly continue to sit on the floor across from Priam among stacks of books and loose papers, looking up with a smile, staring at the second hand on her wall clock. "It's 5:45."

"What happened in 545?" Priam flips through the pages in the new textbook while searching that particular historical date. "Is that another marker for our shared classroom project, Dolly? I think we got more than enough data. Now, we can start working on the actually project tomorrow at school during world history class with Miss R. Hmm! I am not seeing that date here inside the history book. Is that historical date really important?"

She points at the wall clock with a laugh. "I am referencing the current time on my wall clock. The current time is forty-five minutes, after five o'clock. Preston said something about you needing to be home, before six pm..."

"Curfew!" Priam yells out loud in fear and swiftly stands upright from the floor as the papers, pens and books bounce down from her body and lands on top of the carpet in silence. "I must leave." She spins around and stares at the wall clock with worry. "Now! I must go and get outta of here before Curfew!"

"What's curfew?" Dolly slowly stands upright from the floor and smiles at the rear skull on Priam.

"Call back your car and take me home, right now, Dolly!" Priam stares at the clock with worry.

She continues to stand and smile at the rear skull on Priam. "Sorry, girlfriend! That military car only takes me to home and then back to school. I can't order the car, only my father does that. Can I call someone...?"

Priam rushes out the room and dashes through the house using her demon powers, exiting the house, entering into a dark garage space. She flips her one hand and lifts up the unlocked garage door while searching for a swift transport to travel the three miles back to the H Building within the Key West military base before six o'clock, Curfew.

Inside the garage setting, Priam studies the stationary motorcycle on top of the floor and quickly decides no. She does not tote a motorcycle license and could be stopped by one of the local military human guards for speeding. She views the long purple colored skateboard and decides no also. She cannot control a skateboard with her demon powers in front of the earthlings and then sees a mounted yellow tinted bicycle and nods with a smile.

Dolly exits her room, dashes through her house and stops, standing inside the kitchen archway that leads into the garage with puzzlement at Priam.

"Can I borrow the bike, Dolly?" Priam quickly shuffles toward the bicycle with worry as the sun is sinking down into the ocean horizon.

Dolly gasps in alarm. "Can you drive a motorcycle? No! My father will punish..."

"The bicycle," Priam uses her demon muscles and lifts the yellow tinted bicycle from the wall rack and drops the machine down on top of the flat and hard concrete floor, bouncing the rubber wheels up and down in the air, testing the air and texture. "I need to borrow your yellow tinted bicycle for riding back home. My kin will be worried, Dolly."

"How did you lift that bike from the wall and then in the air without my assistance? I must be seeing things." Dolly turns and frowns at the gathering storm clouds. "Geez! It looks like rain and thunder, again, this afternoon. It always rains here every afternoon at six o'clock hour. I hate Florida weather. I thought it was supposed to stay heated and sunny all day long."

Priam straddles the seat and places a hand on each handle bar, parking a foot on one bike pedal, staring into the dark clouds also in silence.

Dolly returns back and smiles at the nose profile on Priam, "Yeah, yeah, go ahead and use my bike, Priam. Don't get wet, Priam." Dolly waves at the bicycle and yells out loud with a smile. "Okay! I'll see you tomorrow, Priam."

"Right!" Priam starts to pedal the bicycle and exits out from the garage, over the smooth driveway and onto the gray colored busy city street, before the Curfew hour.

She swiftly pedals both booted feet and sweat during the sinking sunset. She wishes for teleportation power that goes from Point A to Point B but that is not a demon power. Her pair of coral tinted demon wings are currently tucked down inside her back muscles which are used to fly with her boyfriend angel Preston on their fun trips into the city of Key West.

She continues to pilot her bicycle in the middle of the street within the human neighborhood without releasing her demon wings, unless Priam desires punishment or worse from the gang of demons at the Demon Den.

That is another demon fact, not lore with Curfew at 6:00 pm. No demon or angel can show their expanded supernatural wings to an earthling only another angel or demon.

She continues to pedal and sweats in bright heat, flying faster over the city street pavement as her two legs pump up and down, not touching seat with her fanny. She uses her supernatural demon speed and quickly leaves the rows of residential house, passing a church, then the library while heading towards the common street into the entrance of the military base. She glides through the stop sign and hears the honking car horn.

Something slams sideways into her folded body on top of the bicycle as Priam tumbles forward over the bicycle's handle bars, landing down on top of the smooth gray colored, but hard pavement on both of her palms. Her body continues to roll forward and settles down on her back spine. Her lips are bleeding. The right shoulder muscle is achy and bruised and as her wet tears form within each one of her turquoise colored irises. She lays flat on her back muscles and stares into the dull pale blue skyline.

They come.

"Kid! Hey kid! Are you harmed, kid?" A male human yells out loud in the short distance and then appears, kneeling down beside Priam, leaning over with his sour breath into her teary face.

Priam bolts upright and bends at her fitted waistline. The car of the human male had hit her bicycle when she had steered through the stop sign. Priam had been knocked off the bicycle from the moving human vehicle and then landed down onto the hard pavement.

Priam slowly rolls sideways and feels numerous aches and pains, crawling ahead on her palms and kneecaps, slowly standing upright from the pavement with heavy grunts of pain. Her body is shaky with pain and fear and as she slowly inhales and then exhales, holding her injured rib cage. "Time!" She musically huffs.

The human male slowly stands upright from the pavement and stares at the teenage girl with worry. "Hey, kid! Are you okay?"

"What is the current time?" Priam sways back and forth in the wind and uses her demon power to calm her mind and her aching body.

"Six o'clock."

She scans the skyline and sees the sunset. "No! The current is not six o'clock, not yet. What is the precise time?" Priam slowly limps ahead on a pair of achy legs and arms towards the bicycle in the manicured green tinted grass.

The male human continues to stand in the street and looks down, reading the numbers on his wrist watch with puzzlement. "The current time is 5:54 pm."

"Yes, I have time," Priam whispers for her eardrums only and stops, slowly lifting with her set of painful muscles the destroyed bicycle. The damaged bike gears and hunks of loose metal nosily drop back down on top of the grass. She sighs with worry and spins around, seeing the military base entrance gates in the far distance with her set of demon vision. She pitches the bicycle down to the grass with worry.

The male human points to his unharmed vehicle from the tiny bicycle with worry. "Hey kid! Do you need a ride back home? I can take you back home, before the rain starts. It always starts to rain and thunder at six o'clock from the heated weather. I'm sorry about destroying your bicycle. Hey, kid!"

Priam starts to run away from the damaged bicycle and the confused human over the grass and the smooth pavement, using her demon speed, balancing her upright body with her swinging arms. She travels swiftly the next nine blocks down a double-lane city street. Yellow and red colors start to melt down into the sinking sunset as she approaches the row of sun-kissed buildings inside the Key West military base.

They come.

Priam uses her demon speed and rushes through the open gates, dashing ahead toward the H Building on the second row of dark shadows while viewing a lighted archway with her pair of demon eyeballs in the far distance. She pumps both of her arms and legs with increasing pain, leaving a bloody trail of red tinted blood proteins from her wounded body parts on her clothes and the city street pavement.

They come.

The gigantic steel door gleams in the dull sunlight and continues to slowly close shut. Once shut, the mechanics bolt, lock, and seal both doors for twelve straight hours during Curfew.

They come.

She bends down at her fitted waistline and jumps up from the hard pavement, like an animal, leaping in the air, covering five feet over the hard city street pavement, using her demon strength. The steel door on the H building closes shut without Priam, but the time possess a few more precious seconds before six o'clock in the evening and the start of Curfew.

Priam veers to the side wall and moves towards a strange open door at the end on the H building. She is quickly losing daylight and running out of heated sunshine. She bravely decides that she has to do it, use it, and present it.

They come.

Priam explosively out and then releases her eighteen-foot pair of coral colored demon wings into a full feathery formation as she leaps up from hard pavement and beautiful flies in the air waves, traveling the last three blocks over the street and targets the closing side door of steel. She grits her teeth and bites her tongue, plowing half of her body, including her two hands, one elbow, one knee, one leg, and one demon wing inside a small unfamiliar room, holding the closing steel door open for a millisecond longer. She grunts with determination and jerks the rest of her exposed body outside the door into the tiny room, spinning in a completely circle with a gasp, falling down on her face, chest, both kneecaps, and finally her two legs on top of the hard concrete with a soft thump. She sobs and cries from each one of her eyeballs, smearing the wet blood on her palms, and sweats puddles of water from her nostrils, lips, and both eardrums with happiness.

She made it.

At 06:00:01, during Curfew, Priam continues to rest on top of a cool, smooth flat, concrete floor and hears the familiar loud rumble coming from the natural weather storm of thunder and rain, bombarding the outside steel door signaling the start of Curfew. She slowly crawls on her belly towards the opposite wall from the steel door and stops, standing upright on two kneecaps as pain attacks her back muscles and shoulder bones. She closes eyelashes while exhaling and inhaling with slow breaths.

Priam calms her heart, mind, nerves, and soul with a set of tender loving thoughts of her boyfriend Preston and then opens her eyelashes seeing at the opposite wall, a solid dull gray hue. She twists her face side to side seeing an enclosed room from a single, brightly lit naked light bulb on top of the ceiling tiles.

Inside the Demon Den, a long, continuous row of brightly lit naked bulbs stand on the ceiling tiles also which floods the long hallway with illumination during the twelve hours of Curfew for each demon to work, eat, sleep, play, read, dance, and any other physical or mental activity, until six o'clock the next morning.

Inside the room, Priam quickly surveys the space for her safety and security discovering a storage compartment that contains numerous stinky square shaped boxes which are scattered around the vanilla colored floor.

She slowly moves ahead on her two kneecaps towards first stinky square-shaped cardboard box for support, wrapping both of her arms around the box, like hugging Preston. She straightens and then arches out her back muscles expanding into full length her demon wings, feeling pain.

She slides both hands onto the edge of the stinky sturdy box and shuffles one foot at time, standing on her feet, leaning into the box. She slowly shifts each wing up and down while simulating a pretend flight through the skyline and feeling intense pain.

She slowly flexes each wing into a stationary pose and feels more intense pain.

The she droops each wing down toward the floor with less pain.

However, her body is bombarded with pain from her hair roots down to her non-hairy toe nails while slamming into the partially close steel archway with a pair of expanded demon wings, which is not a good fit, like fitting a circle into a square.

Her pair of wings are bruised, torn, and bleeding, but not broken with passing out pain.

Priam exists in a conscious state, which is a good sign, but she can't see the physical bruises on her back muscles. She continues to feel a biting sting coming from leaking muscle pus and dripping blood proteins that slap down onto the concrete floor with a tiny flop noise.

She stills her body without tucking her wings back down into her bruised muscles, exhaling with deep breaths, inhaling shallow snips of fresh air. Her legs lean against the box for support and as her eyeballs scan her new environment for the rest of the evening, until dawn of a new day.

Each box measures sixteen inches long by sixteen inches wide by sixteen inches deep.

She decides to create a make-shift bed mattress from the scattered boxes for the night to sleep inside the tiny room. The closed door that she had hammered with her left wing is the only entrance and exit point in the room.

The tiny room provides a safe environment from the cold temperatures outside and damp wetness coming up from the floor that tickles her injured demon wings.

She continues to stand and lifts both hands, using her demon telekinesis, designing some of the separated boxes into an eight-pack formation. She has created a rectangular structure on top of the floor a few feet from the rear wall for immediate use while inhaling and then exhaling from the physical work. She gently limps forward on her booted feet and sits down, testing her body weight on top of her homemade bed of pressed wood. The boxes can hold her weight.

She continues to sit in silence with her exposed wings over the edges of the box and stares down at the floor while desiring Preston. He needs to come here and rescue, protect, comfort, help, and kiss her aching body while making her boo-boo wounds better. She needs Preston in here with her, instead inside the Angel Lair with...

On top of the homemade bed of boxes, Priam sobs with unhappiness and loneliness. There is no rescue or escape or cavalry tonight.

Each angel and demon quickly learns, studies, and practices for the Curfew event. Each one plans and then performs the proper steps for the Curfew event, before six pm, every night, every year, every decade, every century, foreverly.

Priam folds her two injured hands into a pair of fists by her side and tires of Curfew as her tears quickly dry up from her heated angry which directs her angry emotions at Curfew, her boyfriend Preston, and her bodily injuries.

She unsuccessfully has debated over and over to convince Preston to leave at 5:45 pm, every night, wanting him and her together forever as a loving and sharing couple for every hour of day and night.

Her face floods again with rolls of hot, wet tears coming from her deep disappointment and sorrow right now without a night of comfort in her private bed inside the Demon Den and without the comfort of her boyfriend Preston.

Crying is a psychology human emotion and physically unbeneficial for a demon. Her shoulders and neck muscles ache from wiping off each wet tear on her face with each scraped finger pad and as she feels exhaustion from the bicycle accident with the human vehicle. She yawns with both pain and sleep, lifting up each boot sole with pain from the floor, shuffling her body on top of her stomach over the homemade bed frame of hard boxes. She wiggles sideways, since her wings can't be tucked down into her torn back muscles. She has trouble breathing air with a covered face and pressure on her trapped chest muscles on top of the hard boxes, since her wings won't cooperate as they are too big, heavy, and tender with pain.

She coughs out loud from the lack of oxygen and then slowly rolls off the homemade bed mattress of boxes, standing upright on top of the floor, slowly back pedaling from her bed. She studies the bed of boxes. Priam slowly moves ahead, stops, kneeling down on the floor, lying her face sideways on top of the rough cardboard box lid, closing her eyelashes, exhaling with exhaustion.

Something touches and then tickles her nose holes. She swiftly jerks her face upright from the funny sensation and holds her skull in the air while feeling pain throughout her body with a deep moan. She slowly inhales and then exhales removing some of the skull pain with her demon power.

Angels and Demons will heal any wounded body part with rest, water and food.

Priam feels hunger as she purges that mental thought from her brain cells, using her demon eyeballs to seek a mounted storage cabinet that might house bottles of warm water.

She tries to stand upright from kneecaps and feels pain shooting throughout her body, gently lowering back down gently to the tile on her kneecaps, placing both arms on the box for her body support. Her eyeballs view the physical irritation that was tickling her nose holes during rest.

On the new square shaped box, the box lid had been slammed shut, before all the physical contents had been properly placed down into the interior pocket.

A small piece of dull parchment hangs loose from the closed lip. Priam reaches down and violently snatches the object with angry and pain. This situation was Dolly's fault for not watching the clock time as ordered by Preston.

Priam leans into the box for body support, relieving some of her back muscle pain, holding the parchment in her hand. Dolly is a nice teen female. Priam was gratefully that Dolly told the proper time, before Curfew.

This morning, inside the high school classroom, Preston had kissed the lips on Prism and then pulled back with a smile, reminding her to return back to the military base, before the six pm hour and the start of Curfew. This is her fault for not watching the time clock at Dolly's house.

On top of the cold concrete floor, Priam continues to hug the box and holds the parchment of paper, exhaling with pain, starting again the flow of hot, wet tears with her frustration, fear, embarrassment, and pain.

After a few minutes later, after completing her crying jazz, her tears press and dry onto each one of her cheekbones and both of red tinted chapped lips. She wipes with her hand containing the loose parchment. The piece of paper is stiff, yellow tinted, and hard feeling on her delicate smooth cheekbone. Then her eyeballs stare, study, and read the torn paper with a row of English words: I saw her go outside after six...

Priam stares down at the tiny hand print on the semi-wet paper note. "I saw her go outside after six..." She gasps in shock and exhales with confusion. "That's impossible. Seeing a person, after six in the evening during Curfew, that is impossible, not real, not done."

She slowly stands tall and straight from the box and continues to hold, re-reading the small paper note, possessing her own demon strength and a girly curiosity. Her eyeballs dart back to the original square shaped stinky cardboard box housing the paper and as her mind ponder the other paper or non-paper contents inside that box. She looks up and scans the tiny room, seeing same boxes which are scattered around the room.

Priam slowly kneels down and easily jerks off the locked cardboard lid with her demon strength, seeing loose stacks of yellow colored parchments, not modern lined notebook paper. From the swift movement, some of the loose papers float in the air near her nose bridge.

Priam giggles and reaches out, retrieving on flying paper that comes from the torn parchment in her other hand, reading out loud. "... pm." She re-reads the entire parchment, "I saw her go outside, after six pm..."

She ponders the incident printed on the paper. "She? The girl has missed the Curfew event, after six o'clock. The girl had been trapped outside during the thunderstorm from the Curfew event." She looks up and stares at forward gray tinted wall inside the tiny room, whispering for her eardrums only. "The storm!" An assortment of loud thunder roars outside and then sheets of heavy rain drops violently pounds against the outside door on the enclosed storage room.

This tiny room has been built into the H building at houses both Demon Den and the Angle Lair along with the school classroom. But the room is not used for warm bodies, but cold books.

Priam slightly shivers from each tiny plume of cool breeze floating through one of the tiny cracks in the door coming from the terrible thunderstorm outside the building.

A demon doesn't like cold or coldness or coolness preferring the heat, hot, sizzling air of wind, water, and sky here in Florida.

Priam mentally tosses the chill of out of her mind and dampens the coldness from aching body as she reaches down into the box and collects more loose paper sheets, sitting down on her kneecaps, reading in silence each tiny handwritten note with intrigue.

The steel door inside the hidden tiny room like the other steel door swiftly slides open at 06:00:01 into a new day within US State of Florida.

Priam slowly exits from the tiny room and stumbles over the golden sands, rounding the corner building with more pain, limping ahead towards the row of picnic tables, where Preston continues to sit and stares at the vast ocean waters.

Morton stands upright and paces back and forth in the sands, mumbling about the missing presence of Priam with worry. He faces the open archway on the building and then sees Priam first, pointing at her without words.

On top of the picnic bench, Preston swiftly spins around with a gasp and sees all of her colorful body wounds within his angel eyeballs, dashing from the picnic table, cuddling her body with love and worry.

Priam displays an assortment of pale yellow bruises and pink tinted cuts on her face, neck, both arms, all fingers, and both legs. Last night, Priam had healed most of the smaller body wounds with her demon healing powers. But she is a young demon with a set of limited talents unlike an older and mature Preston.

Preston cuddles her and slowly moves ahead while whispering down into her face, sitting down at the same picnic bench on the first table, placing a warm finger pad over each one of her cuts and tender bruises as his heated touch heals her body injury making her pale skin sparkle with an orange glow. Once she is healed and glows in orange patches, they eat the breakfast meal while she explains what happened late night.

Preston and Priam slowly limp together through the wide entrance door and move into the classroom environment, staring at the rows of students.

On the fourth row, in the first chair, Dolly swiftly stands with a gasp and stares at Priam. "Priam?"

Preston and Priam halts, staring at Dolly. Preston growls with a sneer at the human girl.

However, Dolly was not at fault for Priam almost missing Curfew. This incident was Priam's mistake. But Preston doesn't like Dolly or any other humans anyways, regardless that Priam had become injured.

Priam reaches out and touches his arm with a smile. "It's okay, Preston."

"What happened to you, Priam? You look different," Dolly studies the orange patches of skin on Priam with worry.

Priam exhales. "I'm so sorry, Dolly. I wrecked your bicycle during my flight home," she giggles with her secret flight of demon wings into the hidden storage room. "But I'll go and get you another one."

"No!" Dolly gasps in alarm and shakes her brown curls with worry. "No. The bike is old. Don't worry about the machine! Are you okay? Did you go the hospital? I am sorry too. I should have called someone for you," she frowns, "You look different..."

"I am fine." Priam wiggles with a smile inside Preston's biceps. "I have some sore muscles from the bicycle wreck, but Preston has been taking good care of me." He leans down and tenderly kisses her cheekbone, pulling back with a sneer at Dolly.

Dolly sits back down in her school desk with a nod of concern while watching Preston and Priam. "All right! I'm sorry about your accident."

"Thanks, Dolly." Priam shouts out loud with a smile and starts to move ahead with Preston toward the second row of school desks. He escorts Priam to her desk and leans down, kissing her lips, pulling back with a smile. Priam sits down with a grin and feel stronger than last year from his tender healing touches.

Preston spins around and waves his hand using his angel magic, parting the straight column of school desks sideways, walking through the empty space. He sits down in his assigned chair and wiggles his fingers, placing the crooked column of school desks back in line. His friends Blaze, Radium, Morton and Barbie see the action and laugh out loud as each one of the stupid human does not see the angel magic.

Preston reaches out and grabs Priam's hand in between the empty aisle, applying more of his angel healing touch to her exterior and interior body wounds during the class time.

On top of the teacher desk, Miss R wears a beige pants suit with a pair of golden earrings, staring into the class. "Time for class! Please, sit down. Good morning! Today, we're going to review the subject of English Literature. So, let's move on..."

"...to next planet..." one student laughs out loud among the rows of school desks.

"...the next solar system..." another student yells out loud with laughter.

"...the next century..." a third student screams out loud with laughter.

"Yeah," a fourth student hollers out loud for fun.

"Please, settle down, teens," Miss R waves her arm and rattles a loose sheet of lined notebook paper in her hand, saying with a smile and a nod to the students. "I enjoyed reading each one of your essays which had been assigned for homework three weeks ago. I particularly find one of them fondly appealing and strangely intriguing. To start our class this morning, I would like to entertain you with this short novelette." She clears her throat and reads out loud. "I remember the appointment of hour, when the young girl disappeared. They said, because I do not see. The skies turn dark blue colorfully. Hurricane winds blow wildly. Hail plummets down the ground roughly. Rain pounds the roof heavily. I sit quietly and rock my knees on top of the cold concrete while hearing everything. Lightning dances on the dirt beautifully. Thunder roars mighty. I sit peacefully and sip my hot drink on top of the cold concrete while hearing everything. The hour never changes, nor space, nor time. I sit calmly and stare studiously at the cold concrete while hearing everything. They come!" She finishes and looks up with a smile. Silence lingers in the air inside the classroom. She nods. "Would any student care to interpret this short essay for me and the class? I must admit it is strangely written. However, I am a little clueless with the written subject matter here. They come..."

"... waggling their tiny tails behind them." Radium swiftly stands upright from his seat on the first row and tosses both arms in the air, twirling in a circle, wiggling his fanny with laughter.

On the second row, in the second seat, Morton swiftly stands upright from the desk and sings with a string of sour notes, snapping his fingers, shaking his hips at Miss R. "Little boy blue, come blow your golden French horn, yeah. The sheep are in the meadows, woe. The cows are in the corn, geez. What does little dog say to me? Bow wow, bow wow, hey!"

"And they come waggling their tiny tails behind them," Radium continues to shout with his natural baritone timber and swirls in place, wigging his fanny with loud laughter.

Then a loud rock and roll musical song starts to play out loud inside the enclosed classroom: Walk this way. Talk this way.

Note: The musical song _Walk This Way_ had been performed in 1981 by the musical group _Aerosmith._

The musical words with guitar strings and drum rolls blast out from each wall corner with a hidden audio speaker. Each student quickly stands upright from their seat and claps, singing and dancing to the roll and rock song, interrupting the class time of academic lessons.

Preston stands upright and then leaps over his chair, rushing to Priam, extending his hand. She slowly stands upright from the chair and cuddles into his chest. They slowly sway side to side with love while the other students shake their arms and legs to the popular rock and roll song.

Priam giggles inside his chest with her demon love.

Colee strolls from barbeque grill pit and totes a tray of food, sitting down on the same bench beside Preston, placing the tray in front of her chest. Preston cuddles with his girl Priam and hand-feeds her bits of food with a smile while ignoring Colee.

On the end bench seat beside his boyfriend Radium, Morton turns and sneers at Colee. "Ah, shucks! She found me again!" He laughs with the other teens.

"Where in the millennium did you come from, Cobra?" Radium turns and growls at Colee.

Morton raises his hand in the air near his smile. "I know. I know. I know. I know the answer. Let me tell the answer, please. O pretty please!" He slaps the hand down to the table and clears his throat, saying with a smile, "She comes from the Stone Age. Am I right? Yes, I am right. Of course, I am right," he nods and laughs with the other teens.

Colee ignores the other two teens and slides closer to Preston, leaning into earlobe with a smile. "I've been looking for you, Preston. Ya vain little monkey, when I happen to smell..."

"The Stone Age is not the correct home world location for Cobra, Morton. But, please, try again with your answer!" Radium sneers with annoyance while trying to get Colee to leave the picnic table, the Key West sandy beach, the State of Florida, and United States of America, and the entire planet.

Blaze turns and sniffs the air wave, sneering at Colee. "You are the one that smells, tot. You happen to be inhaling your own stinky smell, Cobra."

Morton smiles at Colee. "All right! I will try again. Cobra comes from the dinosaur age."

Colee points at Priam, Morton, and Radium with laughter. "While sitting here, I happen to smell each one of these demons that stink all the way up the heavens. Excuse the pun, ya'll!"

"She comes before that, Morton." Radium sneers at Colee.

"Cobra comes from the Ice Age?" Morton smiles.

"She comes before that one, baby." Radium growls at Colee.

Colee scoots closer and bumps into Preston's shoulder, saying with a smile. "It's been a long..."

"It's been over for a much longer time, Cobra. Go away, Colee!" Preston smiles at Priam, moving away from Colee, leaning down and kisses Priam's lips.

Morton smiles. "And I've been around a long time, baby. I've never seen you or heard you name or..."

Colee turns and sneers at Morton. "That's the point here, moron. We all are not to be seen or heard or smelled or reputed..."

"...refuted..." Blaze sneers. "Cobra means to say refuted."

Morton smiles. "Refute means to prove false or erroneous or to deny the truth. I don't think that's the right word, Blaze."

"We are not to be remembered or recalled or realized by a single human on this plane." Colee sneers.

Morton pulls out and types on his mobile telephone, reading out loud to each pair of eardrums. "Cobra had used the correct verb, repute, which means to ascribe a characteristic of a good reputation."

"Cobra doesn't a good reputation. Me thinks, she needs to be re-booted out of our group for being refuted." Radium laughs.

"Colee, go and try one of the roasting hotdog. The food is very good here." Barbie nods to the grill with a friendly tone while desiring to change the heated subject between the demons and angels.

Morton laughs. "The air is sizzling hot with..."

"We live and stand and sit and sleep in hot, sizzling Florida, moron." Colee turns and growls at Morton.

"Morton." Morton slaps his chest with a smile.

Radium sneers. "This place is not hot but strife with a set of throbbing, stinging nerves with bursting veins for a fight..."

"What fight?" Colee frowns.

"Between you and me, sweet-tart," Radium slaps his chest and points at Colee.

Blaze smiles. "Radium, when you black and blue Colee first, I wanna watch. Second, I suggest you beat upon her pair of ugly earlobes with all those glittering golden earrings, she'll be yours for the killing," he laughs with the others.

"Down, boy!" Morton reaches out and pats the naked forearm on Radium, smiling at Colee. "The war has not started."

Barbie tries to subject change from the heated topic with Colee and the war between the demons and angels, nodding with a smile. "There is not going to be another war between demons and angels. We all learned our first and final lesson from the fall of Eden. We are all going to live peacefully and harmoniously." She nods. "Just like, when the universe began fifteen billion years ago, before those dinosaurs came onto the scene after 230 million years, which lasted for 65 million years and then man..."

"...and us..." smiles Morton.

"...along with Adam and Eve and all those stinky animals," Colee frowns. "Do you remember all of these stinky animals too?"

Radium nods with a laugh and rubs his stomach. "Good eats."

Barbie frowns. "I become a vegetarian, because of these stinky, mean mammals."

Morton smiles. "The word, Eden, means delight."

Colee frowns. "Your statement, your purpose, your life is irrelevant, moron."

"Morton," he smiles.

Radium leans over and hugs his guy. "You're a heavenly delight to me, Morton."

"You're really the heavenly delight to me, Radium." Morton reaches up and touches the cheekbone on Radium.

"Not here, tots!" Blaze frowns at the two demons.

Colee frowns. "And then came the slovenly and dimwitted cavemen..."

"...with fire..." Barbie nods.

"My fiery mascot of my soul!" Morton laughs.

Radium lifts up and toasts with his glass of milk, winking at Colee. "My eternal motto to you, sweet-tart: Burn in the hell, baby," he laughs and then consume the milk, burping out loud, slapping the carton top of the table for fun.

Morton nods. "Then the new gang of smarter cave people piled a stack of rocks high in the hair for adding figures and an array of arrow scratches in the dirt for subtraction."

"Then, came the Egyptians." Radium nods.

"And then came the others." Barbie nods.

"And we are all still here." Colee frowns.

"Not for long!" Blaze grins.

"Why are we not long to be here or seen or sniffed, Blaze?" Morton frowns.

"The war is coming." He leans over and performs a fist-bump with Radium, pulling back with a smile.

"What war, Blaze?" Morton frowns.

"The great and grand war between the angels and the demons. It is coming, soonest," Blaze laughs.

"No." Morton shakes his black colored skull.

"Yeah, it is," Blaze looks up and squirts at the sunlight. "Can't you feel the air? I can feel it in the air coming closer and closer..."

"That's the coming rain storm closer to your nose holes," Morton laughs. "This is the hot, heated, sizzling US State of Florida. It rains here all the time from the heated day."

Blaze continues to scan the pale blue skyline. "No, it is the coming thunderstorm for all of us."

Colee finishes her food and frowns at each one of her friends. "Geez! Each one of you are overly melodramatic and deeply fooled."

Blaze looks down and stares with a stern face at the rear skull on Preston. "I do not believe so, Colee."

"There isn't going to be a war never or ever or forever." Barbie shakes her brown curls and stares at the rear skull on Preston. "Isn't that right, Preston?"

"Right, Barbie." Preston smiles at Priam. She struggles from his hug and slides off the shared bench seat, staring down with a smile at Preston in silence. Preston looks up and frowns at her, "Lambie pie..."

"...come and walk with me on the sandy beach shoreline, tonight, before..."

"...Curfew..." Preston quickly stands upright from the bench seat with a smile and tucks Priam into the corner of his chest with a chuckle, facing the sandy beach, "Of course, lamb!"

They swiftly pace ahead on a pair of bare feet towards the warm golden sands as the sun hangs low against the greenish-blue Gulf of Mexico waters signaling the beginning of Curfew.

The day's school events, school lessons, and the heated conversation at the picnic table escapes out from her active mind as Priam prepares to share with Preston her new discovery from last night sleep inside the hidden storage room. She had read numerous yellow tinted ancient notes, before drifting off asleep with both exhaustion and pain.

Now, Priam has a new plan for defeating Curfew, but the current news must not be shared to her friends or foes, only with her boyfriend Preston.

Priam stops walking and stands in the warm water and soft sands, without facing Preston. He gently collides into her petite body with a chuckle. She spins around and whispers into his jaw line. "I've discovered a new way, where we can be together forever, Preston."

Preston looks up and stares at the sinking sunset, "Blaze is correct on two counts. When the war breaks out between the angels and demons, we both can escape from them and Curfew foreverly, Priam," he looks down and smiles at her. "Just the two of us and no more Curfew."

She shakes her curls with a stern face. "No! I have found a new way that will be quicker than a stupid old war."

"How so?" He frowns.

"At Curfew, we can touch and not die like the angel lore tells, not the demon lore." She smiles

"That's impossible, Priam. Where did you hear that fake and false information?" He worries about her state of mind, after her terrible accident on the wrecked bicycle and the company with the human teenager now.

Priam hints all the time at a marriage ceremony with him in order to live inside the Angel Lair. Or she wants to escape the secure military base from Curfew with him either.

Preston wants to marry Priam too as he deeply love her. However, that happy event isn't impossible, not yet.

"I found the new and true information inside one of the electronic books that holds each ancient angel and demon lore stories."

He shakes his blonde curls. "I didn't know about that ancient information, lambie pie. These are words typed into a modern day machine, to me, and sounds too dangerous for us."

"I have more proof, Preston," Priam whips out a stack of tiny yellow colored parchments from the pocket on her fashionable military trousers and lifts the stack into his nose holes. He sneezes out loud from the ancient dust balls. She nods with a smile. "I had found these old parchments inside the hidden storage room, when I had escaped from Curfew. Each note is a tiny letter that has been written by hand, maybe by a human hand."

He accepts the tiny stack of papers and silently reads the first parchment.

I saw her go outside, after six in the evening.

She didn't return to the den, when the doors closed.

By full bright sixth moon in night had passed, I opened eyes playing in sea neglecting duties.

She walked to me turning to smile at children near the port.

On top of the sand and water, Preston drops the stack of notes from his nose and frowns down at her. "Priam, these stack of ancient notes does not un-prove Curfew."

Priam points the stack of papers with a smile. "You didn't read each note. Six months later, this woman saw the child who was alive and breathing inside her Demon Den. We can do this too..."

"...at six pm..."

"...tonight..." She nods with a smile and reaches out, slapping his chest and then her chest. "We, you and I can finally be together each night forever as..."

"As what?"

"As a set of life forms, like a people couple, like a pair of soul mates, Preston," she smiles.

He stores the stack of letters down into his trousers' pocket with one hand, gently smoothing her soft hair, stroking her cheekbone with the other hand. He smiles. "We are a pair of soul mates, lambie pie. We are always together..."

"...until six in the evening."

"And then six in the morning, we come back together."

She pulls back and sways back and forth, tossing both arms in the air and shouting out loud with a nasty timber. "It's all a lie, Preston. I believe Curfew is a lie. And I want to know why. The calendar date shown on letter is 1305 A.D. which is long, long time, before now."

"Okay!" He leans over and cuddles her, pulling back with a smile. "If we want to do this dangerous..."

"Yes, I do," she cuddles with a smile into his chest, pulling back with a nod. "Thank you, Preston. No one knows about this new secret, but us," her eyeballs dart back to the last picnic table with her friends and then return back to see Preston. She nods with a smile of daring excitement. "We can experiment and try it tonight. We can escape from the den and then meet right here on this spot, right here on the beach. Okay?"

He chuckles with a nod and amuses her childish fantasy as they can never escape from Curfew but only Preston understands the reason. He smiles. "Well, there might be a set of fireworks for us or with us or on top of us. I don't know, if we'll disintegrate includes a plume of flames or a pile of ashes or combo of both while escaping from Curfew."

She gasps in alarm and ponders the escape plan.

Once the time of six pm in the evening arrives, no angel or a demon ever breaks away from Curfew. Priam might try to escape tonight, but Preston will tattle to Morton, who will watch and protect his girl like always. Priam and Morton live inside the Demon Den while Preston resides on the other side of the H Building inside the Angel Lair.

Preston leans down and kisses her lips, pulling back with a smile.

"Wow! Yeah! That's a really good point! But I don't think so. I feel it." She smiles. "But I don't understand why Curfew has to be..."

"It just does, lamb." He gently strokes her soft cheekbone and smiles at her pretty face. "Curfew begins at the beginning. And we, you and I can't change it."

"Then, we, you and I can escape from it."

"Maybe, we can, lambie pie," he leans down and kisses her lips, wishing to purge her idea of escaping Curfew and obeying the demon rules. He pulls back and grins down at his girl.

"That is not good enough for me. Do you not question why Curfew exists between the angels and the demons, Preston?"

"Never did. Never will."

She frowns and crosses her arms with a sour tone, "O! I know why. Because, Preston said so." Priam routinely notes that each demon follows his vocal and silent orders, even thou, he is an angel. And his authority has to do something with a battle within the Garden of Eden. She and the other demons do not talk about that ancient incident.

He leans over and smiles down into her face, holding her arms. "No."

She exhales with annoyance. "But, I notice it, too. You are the one that orders everyone around during the day with what to do and where to do it, Preston. I notice that. I'm not..."

"No."

She frowns. "Why are you so overprotective of me, Preston? I can take care of myself."

"You're a..."

"Yes, I am a demon," she stumbles backwards and yells in fury at Preston. "So what? What does a different proper name between us have to do with anything and with us? I am female. You are male. I want to be..."

Morton and Radium stroll hand-and-hand and stops, standing at the back spine on Preston, overhearing the argument. Morton releases Radium and leans over, staring at Priam. "I wanna be what? What do you wanna be now or tonight or tomorrow, Priam?"

Priam exhales with annoyance and softly says. "I wanna be safe and sound for the evening from Curfew." She hopes Morton hadn't overheard the new set of plans for escaping Curfew.

Even though, Priam trusts Morton with her heart and soul. He acts overprotective like her boyfriend Preston, since Morton might try to stop Priam tonight and she doesn't want to see Morton get hurt or punished, if she fails in her difficult and dangerous task with Preston.

Her second reason, Priam possesses some scary big concerns about Radium regarding her secret and her secretively action that might include Morton. Radium deeply loves within his heart and soul his boyfriend Morton and literally lives by the marriage motto: until death, do they part.

On top of the sand and water, Preston winks at Priam. "Of course, she is going to be safe and sound from Curfew tonight." He tosses Morton off the sense and leans down, kissing her lips, pulling back with a smile, spinning around to face Morton and Radium.

Morton hugs Radium and smiles at Preston, "How long have you, two been together, Preston?"

Preston smiles at Morton. "We have been together for a long, long time now."

Morton nods to Priam. "Tell me the story of your introduction again. I always get goose bumps over my entire body. You, two consist of heavenly stuff while staying together for a long, long time now."

She nods with a smile. "It was so wonderful and fabulous. Back then, I was living in the modern town of Mesopotamia."

Morton nods. "Yeah, that lovely place on the beach."

"Mesopotamia was located near the ocean. I had always loved the sun and sand."

Blaze and Barbie appear and stand beside Morton, staring at Priam and Preston in silence hearing the same story again.

"Beach babe, because it's hot." Radium playfully teases Priam with his old memories too.

Priam nods. "I like the salt water and the fresh air and the open sky."

Barbie smiles. "The village of Mesopotamia was hip. Do you remember that, too, Blaze?"

Morton smiles. "Coming from an angel, it was. As a demon, it was very different. I didn't like the attention or attitude of..."

"Them..." Radium sneers.

"Them and they and the things had a different purpose back then." Morton nods.

"Them and they and the things have a different purpose right now, too." Blaze turns and frowns at his girl Barbie.

Radium vividly replays the outcome from the battle within the Garden of Eden, nodding with a sad face. "Then the walls all came tumbling down. The trees all died, right after first born daughter Eve ate that damn red tinted juicy apple from the apple tree branch."

Barbie nods. "Yeah, then we were all locked out of paradise."

Priam nods. "Preston from the Garden of Eden had wandered onto the beach. He was bleeding and hurt."

Morton nods. "Preston had been hurt, after fighting with them."

Preston shakes his blonde curls. "Actually, no. My body wounds had been clawed and marked by a nasty animal, maybe, a wild tiger or a roaming lion or one of these lesser creatures that had been created as entertainment purposes for first son Adam."

Priam smiles. "I remember so clearly. Preston was so helpless and innocent falling down on the sands. I dashed over to help, kneeling over his wounded body, placing my hands over his wound and healed him. He awakened and..."

Morton frowns. "You healed him, but..."

"...as a demon, not an angel." Priam smiles. "Yeah, I did it. Then I was dragged away from him by another demon..."

"... for containment," Colee appears and joined the line-up, staring at Priam. "That's understandable."

Priam smiles. "When I returned, Preston was still there sleeping underneath the native sandy scrub brush. I brought him food and drink. Then we talked, ate, and laughed. We just have the right chemistry."

Colee sneers at Priam. "But, you're a demon...."

"Don't shout that information in the air waves with your forked tongue, Colee!" Morton turns and scans the water for any humans, seeing clear sands and skies. He returns back and smiles at Priam.

Colee points at Priam and then slaps her chest. "I mean to tattle here. You are one of them. I am of one of 'they.' How did you..."

"... stay together with me over ice, lava, meteorites, and dinosaurs and our love eternal," Preston laughs.

"I love Preston." Priam smiles. Preston leans down and kisses her hair roots, pulling back with a wink at Colee.

"True love." Morton smiles at Priam and Preston.

"True luck." Colee literally spits out her mouth salvia over the sands.

"What's true luck, Colee?" Barbie frowns at Priam and Preston.

Colee exhales. "You, two have been together, since the destruction of the Garden of Eden and then separated every night by Curfew."

"Yes." Priam nods with a stern face to Colee.

"O! Do you like this nifty arrangement?" She laughs.

"Yes."

"Geez! Don't your smart neurons every question this?" Colee grins.

"No."

"Wow! Are you really accepting with all of this stuff?" Colee frowns.

"Yes." Priam quotes.

"Our place on Planet Earth is here and for this." Morton nods.

"It sucks." Barbie frowns.

"It stinks." Blaze frowns.

"It's life." Preston nods.

"Can this be broken?" Colee frowns.

"You cannot break Curfew." Preston growls at each angel and demon.

"While we each part at the sixth hour of the evening from each other," Morton nods.

Priam stands on her tippy toes and whispers into his jaw line with a smile. "Think of it, Preston! This time tomorrow, we can be together forever without them." Preston nods with a smile and stares at Colee in silence.

Colee frowns. "You know I never have understood this thing. Why we all can't be together after six, Preston?"

"Six is the number of the serpent, baby." Barbie laughs.

"O! So, this entire thing is the demon's fault. Please, angel!" Morton frowns.

"Shut up, moron!" Colee sneers.

"The name is pronounced as Morton, sweet-tart." Morton laughs.

"Moron, yeah, that what I spoke." Colee laughs.

"Morton." Morton yells out loud with a frown.

"M...o...r...t...o...n... is correctly spelled but pronounced as moron. The letter T is silent, ya'll." Colee laughs.

"No, the letter T is not silence." Morton frowns.

"O my bad sorry, moron, to you!" Colee smiles.

"I don't like her." Morton turns and not to Radium.

"I don't like her, either." Radium leans down and sneers at Colee.

"I think we do a twofer on her." Morton leans down and growls at Colee.

"I think we do a threefer on her." Radium laughs.

"I think we do a 'fourfer' on her." Morton sneers.
Blaze laughs. "It's hardly used, tot!"

"But, sometimes, it is very necessary." Radium laughs at Colee.

Colee gasps in shock. "What are you, two planning?"

Barbie chuckles at silly angel. "They are planning nothing, Colee, darling."

Morton, Blaze, and Radium had been a warrior demons and angels that had been tossed from the Garden of Eden, after the war.

Blaze stares at Priam, "Let's go back to the Curfew thing!"

Morton releases Radium with a moan and moves ahead a few feet, standing in between the two rows of teens, nodding with a smile. "At six pm in the evening, the group of heavenly angels and the gang of hellish demons do not mix. Or they die or implode or explode or something terrible within their body. I don't know which, since I ain't never seen that sinful act performed alive on the stage with a set of deadly fireworks."

"You're a lousy narrator." Colee laughs.

"So, get a lawyer and sue me, angel." Morton wiggles his hips and smiles at Colee.

"I rather eat you, demon-boy." Colee sneers.

Barbie pats Blaze's arm. "Talk dirty to me, babe!"

Blaze leans over and kisses her neck, pulling back with a wink, "Ich dien Barbie."

Priam exhales with annoyance at the silly conversation and shouts out loud with her thoughts. "Can we be wrong about Curfew?"

"No." Preston shakes his blonde curls at each one of his friends.

"Does anyone know of anyone...?"

"No."

"Does anyone know of anyone who has tired...?"

"No." Preston continues to shake his blonde curls at each one of his friends.

Blaze stares at Preston. "Are you going to try to...?"

"No." Priam gasps in shock with her secret and shakes her black colored curls, staring at each one of her friends and foes.

"Why are you so curious in Curfew, Priam?" Morton turns and frowns at her.

"Adam did it." Blaze laughs.

Radium laughs. "No, Eve did it. We all got screwed over, after Eve ate that damn apple from the Tree of Knowledge."

"...and then them..." Morton nods.

"...and then they..." Radium nods.

"....and then the un-human things..." Barbie frowns.

Blaze exhales with annoyance. "Everyone, stop your belly aching here and now. I told you before, the war is coming soonest."

Colee frowns. "And I have heard the rumor that there is no war coming soonest, Blaze. So, I guess you gotta go and beat up on something or someone else," she laughs.

"Who told you that untrue rumor?" Blaze turns and frowns at Colee.

"All wars are started by a vicious and beautiful female." Morton laughs.

Barbie gasps in shock, "Not fair!"

"But, so true!" Radium nods with a laugh. "Take the name of clever Queen Cleopatra, beautiful Helena of Troy, smart Joan of Arc and that wicked first born daughter Eve."

"Between every great man, there's a vicious, beautiful woman." Morton points and laughs at Colee.

"Curfew!" Blaze points at the glowing rays of blue, red, pink, yellow sunset and drops his arm over his girl Barbie, slowly spinning them around to face the H Building. They slowly move ahead and whisper into each other eardrums with smiles of happiness.

The other demons and angels slowly stroll over the sands as a pair or alone and then enters the open archway before six o'clock.

Preston and Priam hug and then stop inside the busy hallway while the other demons and angels scoot around the stationary couple into their assigned apartment homes. He kisses her lips and pulls back with a wink, releasing Priam, gently shoving her ahead toward the archway at the Demon Den into Morton's protective hands for the evening.

Priam spins around and nods to Preston while winking with their secret, bumping into Morton. She swings around with a gasp and folds down at her stomach, coughing out loud, mumbling her words, "I'm going straight to bed now. I feel really tired from the day's activities. Good night, Morton! I love you," she swiftly scoots around the standing pair of Morton and Radium and holds her stomach, dashing down the hallway.

Radium spins them around from the archway and stares at Priam in silence. Morton shouts out loud at her folded form with worry, "Good night, Priam. I love you." Priam turns the wall corner in silence and disappears from his eyesight. Morton frowns with concern, "I am really worried about her."

"What for?" Radium moves ahead with a smile and drags Morton toward their family den room. "She made Curfew tonight. And she is heading towards her bedroom tonight. So, we are finally free of her tonight."

He frowns. "I should go and check on her."

Radium pulls Morton tighter into his chest and whispers down into the cheekbone on his boyfriend. "No, Morton! She got a good healing from Preston's powers which takes time to heal any supernatural body. You heard her terrible story from last evening. She had wrestled with a steel door," he laughs. "Even I can't win with a steel door. Her body is aching from the fight. Leave her be, for once! The night is young and I'm frisky for you, honey," he turns and moves down their family den, kissing the cheekbone on Morton.

Morton exhales with worry but wants to please his boyfriend tonight, "All right! Priam is tired and I'm not," he giggles with excitement.

On the opposite hallway, Priam quickly dashes ahead and enters the playground room, gently closing the door, wiggling side to side with excitement as her demon mind counts off the minutes and seconds until six o'clock. She does know what ploy Preston is playing on the angles inside the Angle Lair. But she is lucky that Morton is busy with Radium tonight. Her task will be easy and fast getting through the steel door without fighting with her friend Morton.

At 05:58 pm, now, it is time to escape from Curfew.

Inside the playground room, she gently opens the door and peeks out into the hallway, seeing emptiness, feeling stillness. Every demon and their family members or single person is settling into their usual night ritual for the evening.

She dashes out the door and leaves the metal door open, slamming her body into the side wall with a heavy grunt, folding down at her fitted waistline. She races ahead and bumps into the wall while watching the environment for a stray demon but the space is clear.

In front of the H building, the wide and tall door archway is still open, without a guard. But Priam has to be careful that one of the older adult demons is not mentally or physical monitoring the building entranceway from the top floor.

She continues to dash ahead and stops, storing her folded body inside a shadowy corner near the tall and narrow mechanical gear box, kneeling on the floor. The tall gear box is made of solid silver tinted lead and automatically operates this evening, slowly lowering down a heavy solid steel door, sealing the gang of demons and angels inside building during Curfew for some unexplained reason.

No one opens or lifts that steel door upright, after six pm, for any reason.

A row of dull steel teeth slowly plunges a three-ton solid steel door down into a jagged grid that lies smoothly on top of the flat floor which will lock and bolt each person inside the H Building. The door is nine feet from the bottom right now.

No one leaves the building during Curfew. No one comes into the building during Curfew either.

An array of weird creaks and cracks echoes through the empty hallway. Priam recalls hearing the haunting sound at night while playing or studying inside her private room underneath her warm bedspread, so many times.

But, tonight, this is different.

Priam does not see Preston anywhere in the hallway or along the wall. So he had not been success leaving his Angel Lair without attention from one of the other angels. No matter. Priam is going to venture outside the military base by herself and all alone without Preston.

She is going to test her working theory. A demon or an angel can exist outside the steel door after six pm and very importantly, a demon cannot die during Curfew.

She continues to kneel on top of the cold concrete and mentally thinks: **Please, be right!**

Her theory is based on the scattered boxes of hidden yellow colored parchments which are thousands of years old and written down by some ancient hand from a human female, who had eyewitnesses a young girl that had exited out a building and then had returned back and survived outside within the nasty thunderstorm weather during Curfew.

Three feet from the bottom latch, Priam has calculated a safe distance of one foot or twelve inches, where her thin body can smoothly roll over the flat floor and underneath the falling steel door.

Holding her breath with anxiously eagerness, Priam drops down on the floor and faces the open archway in a sideways pose, swiftly rolling ahead over the smooth concrete floor as every other demon is safety tucked inside their den room for a food dinner or school lessons or a family fun activity.

She tucks both of her arms and hands beside her waistline looking like a bumpy cylinder, rolling her underneath a row of sharp steel teeth, heading towards the soft golden sands. Then her sideways body hits the edge on the grid floor and gets stuck. She gasps in alarm and views the row of stationary sharp teeth on the bottom of the door, shoving with two her elbows points and two kneecaps, rolling her body over the uneven surface at the doorway.

06:00:03 p.m.

Purple colored storm clouds, without sunlight

Air temperature 56˚F

Precipitation 100%

Northern winds at 29 mph

Outside, her face slaps down on top of the hard wet concrete at the open archway that has been painted with rows of sticky saltwater spray coming from the heavy storm winds. She continues to roll horizontally ahead and roughly bounces down into the wet manicured grass, flipping over one more time and halts. She views the row of jagged teeth that loudly settles down into the flat grid, locking the steel door on the H Building.

She smiles at her life without a death act and her successful trip, quickly flipping down onto her belly, crawling over the grass in the terrible wind storm without the raindrops. She swiftly moves towards the exterior wall on the H building in stark white paint, while surveying each life form in the sands or on top of the grass without seeing another demon or human.

Priam crawls ahead, hides behind a row of light green plant bushes several feet from the closed door entrance, and stops, crouching down into a tiny figure, exhaling with excitement. The scrub bush displays a geometric array of tiny green tinted branches that exhibit tiny individual yellow and light green leaves which attack her pale skin as each bush needle protests the invasion of its privacy against the wall. She scans the sands and grounds again with her demon eyeballs without seeing an animal or human life form, starting at the eastern side of the building that displays white tinted blocks.

Within the US State of Florida, a building structure is composed of concrete materials and sand grains, which is called stucco. A stucco block can be painted like an exterior wall with any color of the owner's desire. The Key West USA military base paints everything stark white. The light color reflects efficiently each bombarding heated sunray from the building structure better than a medium or dark hue. A stucco wall also helps the building structure stand upright against the tough weather patterns, such like, hurricanes, tornados, and floods.

Behind the row of scrub plants and against the exterior wall, Priam inhales and then exhales while lowering her racing heart rate, calming her jumbled emotions of excitement, nervousness and thrill-ness as she sits down on top of the sand, alive and breathing, outside from her Demon Den for the first time during Curfew.

Her working theory is true. She is not dead or has not exploded into plume of fiery flames or is not sick in her body either.

She performs a crouch-run ahead as her fanny skims the rough sand moving towards the 15th window glass from the closed door entrance, counting silently each window pane frame. She had memorized the specific location from the beach, the rows of picnic table, and the manicured yard this morning during breakfast, this afternoon during lunch, and this evening at the dinner meal ensuring she reaches the correct one.

This exposed glass window belongs to her boyfriend Preston.

He is going to be receive a happy surprised, when Priam pops up from the sand and slams her folded fists into his steel curtain.

She stops below the 15th glass window and then slowly stands upright from the sand with a smile, facing a square shaped window frame which covers each bedroom glass with a single dull looking steel blind curtain as Curfew requires each glass window to be locked, sealed, and shut up, right and tight.

You cannot see out and no one cannot see inside.

When Priam proves beyond the heavens that a demon or an angel can stay and play outside the building structure all night until early morning hours, she and Preston can play, stay, and be together twenty-four hours, seven days, and 365 days within the calendar year. And they can finally can move away from the other nasty demons and angels.

On top of the sand, Priam spins around and surveys the sand, the ground, and the beach.

Beautiful!

The sun slowly sinks down into the water horizon as its rounded face brightly shines in a yellowish-orange tone like a soft yawn with its rays outstretching like an arm across the vast bluish-green waters that colors in reds, purples, blues, yellows, pinks, greens, golds, and silvers surrendering the hot sweaty day into the lazy still cool night.

Awesome!

Priam has never seen a real sunset other than a fake one inside a picture book or a video film.

Every bird, animal, plant, and insect quietly stills, drifting off asleep, exhausting their romp during the hot afternoon here in Florida within her sensitive demon eyesight and eardrums.

Soft sounds of playful fish thrust on the edge of the ocean as an array of soft thumping of ocean waves hit the lazy sand dunes over the shoreline.

On top of the sand, Priam ducks down below the steel curtain on the 15th glass window and stands on her kneecaps. She wonders if Preston can hear all of any mystical sounds coming from the seashore while he fumbles around playing a game of basketball hoops with his angel friend Blaze or reads his ancient collection of silly superhero comic books or surfs the internet on his personal laptop.

She reaches down and digs both of her cupped hands making a shallow hole down in the sand, below the new plant bush with branches of large green-tinted elephant-sized, sitting down in the hole. She crosses her legs and leans her back spine into the damp, cool stucco blocks, closing her eyelashes, willing her mind to connect inside Preston's mind.

A mind reading talent or telepathy does exist between an angel and a demon. However, Priam has lots of difficulty with that particular supernatural demon talent, since she is a demon and Preston is an angel. They aren't exactly alike in celestial formation, so his angel talents are harder for her mind to capture and hold.

Preston says that Priam will master the telepathy talent when she is an older and mature demon.

Right now, Priam is young demon when she is compared to all of the other den mates. An angel and a demon must leave the Demon Den at sixteen years old as opposed to a human teenager.

The demon concept is inconceivable within a loving human family kicking their teenage out from their home.

However, Priam is not a human teen but a demon teen as the concept is very common among each one of the teen demons who desire to leave their Demon Den and find a mate within another Demon Den.

Priam is very happy here living with Preston and does not desire to live inside another Demon Den or with another demon male, only her angel guy Preston.

She doesn't recall her set of biological parents either, after the war from the Garden of Eden. But Preston and Priam have continued to hop around the globe and have resided in a different Demon Den while searching for her demon parents. He has been so sweet and kind aiding her search to uncover her parents. Preston says that her parents exist and they will keep searching for them. With Preston by her side, Priam is happy and feels no worries.

She only worries about the _Secloporus woodi_ or a brown striped scrub lizard running up her leg or arm, tickling her nerves. The scrub lizard is a Florida native inhabitant that resides inside the scrub bush plant sleeping among the yellow and green pointy fern scrounging for beetles and bugs for its meal time meal.

Tonight, she and the lizard share this prime spot.

Priam continues to sit inside the shallow hole with a pair of closed eyelashes, concentrating on Preston's presence, visualizing him inside his room, which is located above her hair roots. Then she hears a set of faint and familiar voices.

She presses her tender back spine and bruised shoulder muscles into the wet concrete while translating the set of soft muffles inside her mental mind.

"Do you not know what the proper noun Preston means, Preston?" Colee laughs inside Preston's room.

Preston resides inside his room and sneers back. "The word, Preston, means a priest settlement. Of course, I do, Cobra."

"You got the right name, tot?" Blaze laughs inside Preston's room also.

"What do you want, now, Cobra?" Barbie sneers and sits inside Preston's room too.

"Why are they all mean to me, Preston? I don't enjoy hearing any of these nasty nicknames." Colee whines.

Blaze chuckles. "Why now? Each one of these nasty nicknames fits your nasty personality like a glove and so well, tot."

Barbie says. "Look! That and Colee is not the issue here. She will find out in given time, Preston."

"Good! The little demonette needs to know." Colee laughs.

"What will happen then, Preston?" Barbie says.

"War, peace, love, hate..." Blaze laughs.

"What would you do, if it was you, Colee?" Barbie asks.

"I would hate you and your guts for the rest of eternal, Preston." Colee laughs.

"You're a mean and evil life form, Colee." Barbie shouts.

Colee chuckles, "Well, I am honest. You, three little things are the true beasts. If someone told her, then she'd be gone in a flash and hurry back to the..."

"Enough, Colee!" Preston orders.

"Preston, do you remember us?" Colee says.

"No, Cobra!" Preston sneers.

"Colee, you used to call me, Colee. Say my name, please, Preston." Colee says.

"Colee." Preston says.

On top of the sand and below the 15th window, Priam continues to sit in the sandy hole with her closed eyelashes, whispering out loud for her eardrums only, "No, Preston! Please, no! Preston, please, not Colee."

Clouds of thunder loudly rumbles above the buildings and her hair roots as numerous bolts of yellow, blue, and white colored individual streaks of lightning wildly dances across a dark sky, producing both beauty and terror.

An array of bright bolts of lightning flash within her closed eyelids as she continues to sit and hides behind the row of pale green scrub bushes. Priam opens her eyeballs and spots a tiny peek hole through crisscrossed array of thick green tinted branches on the single bush, seeing a purple colored skyline. She shuffles her back spine from the wet stucco sticking onto her pink colored tee shirt, worrying about the spectacular weather pattern. She cannot enter back into the building, so her body will become wet from the rain storm.

Her worried mind flashed back yesterday, after slamming her body into a steel door, jumping into a tiny room of shelter within the H Building that had exhibited the intensity which discharged across a nasty skyline.

An assortment of small dots of bright colors twinkle up from the calm blue ocean water behind the nasty-looking dark blue colored skyline. Cloud cover is both dark and thick that you can't distinguish any geometric formation, only the constant paint brushing of a black and angry skyline.

The high winds increase and blows numerous grains of golden sand crystals across the air flying southern away from the other buildings, structures, and occupants. Gusts of cold and fridge air taunts Priam with a winter's smile in the middle of July on top of the hot beach here in Key West, Florida.

However, the ocean waves continue to tap a staccato rhythm of musical tempo within the approaching thunderstorm without a vicious water ripple or rough sea foam or high tidal wave that usually invades the delicate small hills of golden sand dunes and low lying sandy picnic area.

The wind breezes feel strong, cold, and brisk, but it does not affect the physical alignment on the stationary row of picnic tables, where the angels and demons sit and eat the food tray. Not one road sign has been dislodged from its post or a strange physical object has blown inside the manicured grass from the hurricane winds that bombard the H Building.

The weather pattern of loud thunder and bold lightning bolts only focus here at the H Building, not beyond the outer limits of the beach shoreline or groves of shade trees or wild flora gardens.

Strange!

The sound of the weather elements crescendo into the climaxing bong from a musical battle march.

On top of the sand, inside the shallow hole, behind the row of scrub bushes, Priam covers each earlobe with a hand buffering out a set of harsh and loud cymbal tones and leans back into the wet wall for protection from the violent thunderstorm as she closes her eyelashes and hopes for the finale ending soonest.

Then the roaring thunder ceases. The air waves are quiet.

Then the roaring thunder ceases. The air waves are quiet.

Behind the scrub plant, Priam continues to sit inside her shallow hole and removes both of her hands, opening her eyelashes and views the tiny peek hole through a thick entwinement of green tinted leaves, seeing movement on the beach shoreline. She gasps in shock.

She narrows her eyelashes and uses her demon vision, clearly seeing three upright figures that are silhouetted on the edge of the ocean water in the sand as they face the sparkling Gulf of Mexico waters, not the H Building.

She can't make see a facial feature, only a set of parted feet.

On each figure, each arm is bent at a fitted waistline as each one mumbles to each other. Clearly, the stance displays an impression of very tall male. One rear skull possesses a set of black tinted shoulder length, naturally wavy hair. The second male displays a red tinted ponytail on his rear skull. The last male shows a bald head in beige tone. Each male wears a set of white colored fitted clothing covering the body and displays a pair of folded down white tinted wings on their back spine.

They come.

On top of the sand, behind the bush plant, inside the shallow hole, Priam greatly desires to stand and knock down the steel curtain inside Preston's window, which is not a good idea. Preston cannot hear her childish bangs on the thick steel panels that covers the glass window for protection from the nasty wind, blowing sand, loud thunder, and bolt of lightning.

Running to a bigger scrub inside the courtyard that stands at the end of the building is further away from the standing three males, but she axes that idea. The three unknown males would be able to see and hear her movement.

So, Priam decides the best executive decision is to stay put and stay safe.

They come.

Priam studies the trio of males that continue to stand on top of the sandy shoreline without movement.

Each one loudly mumbles with a set of incoherent words and stares at the calm ocean waters as a soft ripping wave washes over a pair of white tinted boots. The loud thunder and bolts of colorful lightning abruptly has ceased rumbling and tumbling within the dark sky.

The three males might be responsible for creating the nasty environmental special effects to get everyone's attention. The nasty effects have gotten her attention as it has gotten each angel and demon running back behind a row of steel curtains.

Each cloud is painted in dark blue hue in the skyline above the trio of males and as the air coats her folded body behind the bush plant with rows of fridge coldness. Priam wraps her arms around her two naked biceps, expecting the heat of night with a set of Florida air temperatures that hovers at 85 degrees Fahrenheit, in the month of July, with 89 percent humidity.

She is not sweating with smelly water of fun, instead she is freezing with icicle goose bumps of fear right now. Priam dislikes the cold air, preferring the sunny warmth on her pale skin and freckles.

However, Priam is alone and not hurt, this time, but alone again, wishing so hard Preston could be here to comfort and protect her.

Also, she can never tattle to Preston her true scary adventure here tonight as he will freak out that she had been sitting below his glass window outside the H building and outdoors during Curfew with three unknown supernatural males on top of the beach monitoring the ocean waters.

She doesn't hear anymore soft muffles coming out from Preston's room into her mind and closes her eyelashes while wishing all the terror away on the beach and inside Preston's room. Light rolls of faraway thunder clouds lightly rumble around the skyline, blocking her demon hearing as her mind worries about Preston with his former girlfriend Colee, who sits so close to his presence inside his private bedroom.

On top of the sand, behind the plant bush, in the shallow hole, Priam feels tired and sleepy, rubbing her eyelashes, yawning from the day's stress and tension. Her working theory is wrong regarding the false information coming from each one of the ancient handwritten parchments that still reside inside the hidden storage room. Because of her silly error, she gets to spend-the-night with the scrub bush lizard tonight until dawn of a new day.

Mr. Lizard is really a cool species as the reptile swiftly streaks up and down the green colored bark on the scrub bush, trying to catch its evening meal. She opens her eyeballs and watching the creature entertaining her neurons jumping from leaf to leaf.

Then Mr. Lizard impossibly leaps up from the bark through in the air, over the sandy ground, her two legs, her knees and over her left shoulder, landing down on top of Priam's hair roots, accidentally jerking her golden hair ribbon down from both her earlobes. The satin ribbon slowly floats down around her naked neck. Priam yelps with alarm. "No!"

She leans down toward the plant and slaps the branches, violently shaking each one of the large elephant-shaped leaves on the bush away from the stucco building, wiggling her body side to side. the lizard quickly jumps down off her bone skull and vaults down onto her right collar bone, her right forearm, her right kneecap, and then her foot, scampering down onto the sand, running away in between the metal grill slants that are built into the foundation concrete building.

A typical Florida house is built on top of a flat slab of poured concrete, since the flat slab is both cheap and fast without a snake as the snakes like to play in the hot South Florida tropical weather too. Preventing an un-welcomed and warm baby creature living underneath a hollow and empty structure foundation, the Florida slab foundation kisses the sand with five inches of hard concrete.

However, in the year 1925, the US military base structures here in Key West had not been built on top of a flat concrete slab that held the house foundation in place for a newly recruited Navy pilot and their family member, instead it is a raised space of empty air and body crawlspace.

Present day, the H Building contains modern technology including with cables, wires, and gadgets that trails underneath the air waves inside the hollow crawlspace of the foundation floor that operate state-of-the-art computers and plasma television devices for each occupant.

Mr. Lizard's hidey hole is one of the many access panels which are located around the stationary building as each foundation is filled with a mixture of dirt and sand for ease of accessing any electronic repair or a military inspection.

On top of the sand, in front of the scrub bush, inside her shallow hole, Priam reaches up and grabs the loose ribbon around her neck, swiftly arranging, tying her golden colored hair ribbon back in place on top of her soft hair roots. Her giggle quickly carries over the air waves and as she looks up and see movement on the shoreline.

In the wet sand and salty ocean water, an unknown male swiftly spins around away from the calm waves and faces the stationary building, studying the row of pale green colored scrub bushes, staring at in her direction in front of the 15th window.

On top of the sand, in front of the scrub plant, inside her shallow hole, Priam cringes in fear and fright, sitting on the sand.

The black haired male points directly at the line of Florida scrub plants, which is Priam's secret spot at the moment. He reaches over with a smile and slaps the chest on the tall unknown male with a red colored ponytail that hangs off his rear skull. The three unknown males slowly strut through the water and sand, moving in unison towards window number fifteen.

They come.

It is impossible for one of three males to overheard her tiny yelp coming from lips when the jumping lizard landed down on her body as each one is too far away from a single audible sound, but not her visual movement.

She is a demon that broadcasts a demon in red hue like a red colored flashlight that shine up into the black sky.

Surveying the sandy ground, Priam brilliantly conjures a single idea, hiding inside the empty foundation which will block her shiny aura of red hue from the three curious males. She spins around and reaches out, touching the metal grill that access the foundation crawlspace with fright. She looks back over her collar bone and see the three males who continue to stroll at a steady pace.

Priam returns back and grabs two of the smooth squares inside the metal grill, balancing the weigh as best as she can within her tiny hands. She slowly lifts up and then pulls the grill from the building using her shoulder and stomach muscles as she grunts in pain.

The grill slightly shifts from the sand as she jerks with all her demon might with a series of loud grunts. She shifts the grill and clears each one of the side latches, tilting up the object, shuffling the metal over the sand. She guides her folded body on her kneecaps and totes the grid inside the short foundation opening, looking back over her collar bone.

The three unknown males continue to approach the building and then separate and spread out, forming a triangular-shape, combing the row of light green scrub bushes, probing and poking a booted feet and a naked hand down through the short needles and the elephant-sized leaves. The three males have not actually seen her red tinted demon aura, maybe a short glitter of some type of mysterious bright light.

On top of the sand, inside the foundation space, underneath the H building that house all the other sleeping or playing angels and demons, Priam returns back to see the dark and open space, slowly crawling with hands and kneecaps over the moist sand, towing the heavy grill beside her leg. She slowly moves deeper inside the empty foundation space and away from the open access panel that leads outside to the thunderstorm and the trio of unknown males.

Priam stops and drops the grill down in the soft sand without a noise while slowly inhaling and then exhaling with a set of deep breathes of fear and terror. She continues to crawl deeper over the dirty wet sand underneath the foundation space and then stops, carefully spinning around without hitting her hair roots or her damaged wings, seeing the row of light green colored scrub bushes through the open access panel, without protection from the weather elements and the trio of males.

Then, a rounded tip from a cowboy boot, scruffy and worn, appears underneath the plant bush as the tough leather needs to be spit polished into a glowing shine.

Inside the foundation space, Priam covers her mouth with her hand to stay quiet with her fear.

They come.

A glowing light surrounding the boot is colored in white hue signaling an aura of white. The toe tip slowly swishes back and forth over the sandy ground at the edge underneath the bush plant outside the building.

Inside the foundation space, the lizard scampers ahead and moves besides Priam over the sandy ground and then swiftly races ahead, exiting the access panel, traveling across the pointy tip on the cowboy boot. The lizard rushes ahead to the next scrub bush for its food male.

In front of the row of scrub bushes, a rich, deep baritone timber laughs out loud at the tiny reptile. "There goes your prey, hoss." A new tenor voice chuckles along with the baritone timber in sweet harmony.

The toe tip on the boot jerks backwards and disappears from the bush plant and as a deep bass voice says, "I did see something here."

"Time to leave, hoss!" The baritone timber orders.

Three unknown males with each a glowing white aura spin around from the row of scrub bushes and face the ocean water, exploring out a pair of white feathered 22 feet wings in the air, slowly strutting back toward the ocean. The line of males moves away from Priam, the row of plant bushes, and the H building.

They disappear.

The musical array of loud thunder roars in the air waves. Bolt of colorful lightning dances wildly in the dark sky. Rain pounds down in heavy sheets of large raindrops hitting each steel curtain on every window, the sandy ground, the rooftops, and the row of healthy scrub bushes.

Inside the foundation space, on top of the set sand, Priam feels afraid, frozen, numb, and alive as she is also stuck inside the underground tunnel for the rest of the night, until daylight at six am.

Curfew begins at six in the evening and ends at six in the morning for each angel and demon here on the military base.

Priam cannot crawl out from the foundation space and return back into her Demon Den, because no one can hear her two pounding fists on either the thick steel door or one of the thick steel curtains. If she is discovered, Priam might get into some serious trouble for remaining outside during Curfew also.

Her face drops down into her folded arms for protection from the whipping sharp partials of sand, leaking overhead raindrops that bombard her skull and neck as she cries herself to sleep.

Priam slowly limps through the open archway and wears one of her fashionable, military-style, pair of pink and white fatigue-patterned walking shorts and a clean solid pink colored tee shirt, meeting Preston at beachside. She feels exhausted after barely sleeping on top of the puddles of wet sand and dripping cold water coming down from each cracked wooden planks. He entire body had become soaked with dirty rain water from her hair roots down to toe bones while feeling the damp moisture and fridge cold air.

She stops a few feet from Preston and sneezes out loud, blowing a string of green colored snot balls from her red colored nose into the dry facial tissue.

On the first picnic table, Preston swiftly stands from his favored spot and wears expressions of worry and concern on his face, dashing to his girl Priam. "Lambie, pie, where have you been?" She sneezes again and cleans her red nose with the same wet facial tissue. He stops and hugs her body, pulling with a sad face. "You have acquired a bad cold, lamb,"

Priam sobs with tears of joy and sorrow regarding her secret experience from last night. She blows out the wet green colored mucus from her nostrils that attacks her weakened immune system.

"Ah! Is my little lamb feeling bad?" Preston shuffles them around and moves back to the same bench seat, sitting her inside his lap. He places his warm hand over her heated forehead as he closes his eyelids using his angel powers. His hand turns bright red on her forehead and applies his warming touch to her head cold. She continues to sit and inhales, exhaling with a set of deep breathes, feeling less congestion inside her two lungs and her nasal passages.

"Is my lambie pie better?" Preston leans down and whispers into her eardrum. She nods in silence and opens her eyelashes smiling at Preston.

He cups her legs and back spine underneath his arms and then slowly standing upright from the bench seat, cuddling Priam, leaning down and kisses her hair roots. He is a biological being also and could easily acquire her bad cold germs too. He pulls back and smiles, slowly lowering her body upright on top of the sand, smiling into her face. They slowly spin around and face the H Building moving into the classroom for the school session.

At the last picnic table with the angels and demons, Radium shares the long bench seat with his boyfriend Morton, eating the food meal and stares with interest at Priam and her weak medical state. "How did you become sick, Priam?"

"I didn't know a demon could become sick with a sickness." Blaze shares the end bench seat with his girl Barbie and eats the food meal while staring at Priam.

"Sick in the head is the accurate expression for a demon." Colee sits beside Barbie and eats, staring at Priam.

"Shut up, Colee!" Morton sneers and then smiles slapping his chest. "I have never been sick. I'm as healthy as a horse," he eats and stars at Priam.

"You don't know what a horse looks like, moron." Colee laughs.

"Morton." He smiles. "And I have ridden a horse."

"When did you ride a horse?" Colee frowns.

"I believe it was in the year 4300 B.C." Morton nods.

"Really! You have ridden a horse in the year 4300 BC." Colee smiles and eats the food.

"Yes, I have ridden an Arabia horse with a set of white paws." Morton chuckling.

"Hoofs." Colee corrects.

"How did you become sick, Priam?" Radium eats and stares at Priam.

"Hmm! A demon does not become sick. Are you maybe possessed, Priam?" Morton frowns.

"No, tot!" Blaze eats and shakes his skull while answering for Priam.

"Is she possessed, Radium?" Morton stares at Priam.

Radium leans over and invades her space while sniffing and wiggling his nostrils at her air currents.

"Hey, man!" Preston reaches out and shoves back Radium away Priam, sneering at the demon with jealousy.

Morton reaches out and pats the naked forearm on Radium, nodding with a smile at Preston. "Let him sniff her, Preston. He is the real Ra, the sun god of the Egyptians with super powers."

"He is super Ra!" Blaze laughs and then eats the food.

Radium has sniffed enough of her germs and shakes his buzz cut. "She ain't possessed. She is sick with the common cold that includes a runny nose, congestion, coughing..."

Priam sneezes as a string of green colored mucus shoots out of the nose down into her open palm. "Green snot." Morton points at her red tinted nose.

"Yuck!" Barbie yells with disgust.

"I'm finished with my lunch." Colee shifts her plate to the side.

Preston materials a red colored blanket and wraps it around her body whispering a string of sweet words of love into her eardrum.

"Don't wrap her too tightly, Preston. She needs good air circulation to kill all of the bad germs." Barbie frowns at Priam. "Priam seems to have a fever also. Her forehead is colored in red hue."

"Do we have doctors?" Morton frowns at Priam.

"No." Radium eats and stares at Priam.

"Do we have doctor demons?" Morton continues to frown and stares at Priam.

"Is that a pun, moron?" Colee laughs.

"No, that's a serious demon question." Morton frowns at Priam.

"Give her some food." Barbie nods and stares at Priam.

"Feed a cold. Starve a fever." Morton nods to her.

"Well, she has a cold and a fever. What do you do then, Dr. Demon?" Barbie stares at Morton.

"Me!" Morton slaps his chest with shock.

"You are a demon." Barbie nods.

"He is not a doctor." Colee frowns.

Morton smiles. "Give her a cracker and then make her regurgitate it back up."

Barbie frowns. "Yuck."

"Gross." Blaze sneers.

Colee huffs. "You're sicker than Priam, moron."

"Morton is fit and healthy. I can attest." Radium laughs. Morton leans over and hugs Radium.

"Not here, tots." Blaze frowns and eats the food.

Barbie smiles. "Colee means to say that you are a mentally mad Dr. Demon, Morton."

"Thank you, Colee, for the nice compliment!" Morton grins.

"How did you become sick, Priam?" Radium eats and stares at Priam.

Priam chews and swallows the saltine cracker from Preston wiping her runny nose on the napkin. "Well, I want to bed with my hair wet."

"Did you really got sick from that?" Morton frowns.

"Yeah!" Priam grins without nodding.

"I go to bed with my hair wet all the time. I never got sick. Do I, Radium?" Morton smiles.

"Demons didn't become sick." Radium eats and stares at Priam.

"Don't start with the demon possession, again!" Barbie frowns.

"We live near the beach." Morton nods to Priam.

"So!" Colee eats and stares at Priam.

"We live near the beach with bugs." Morton smiles.

"So!"

"So, a big ugly bug bit her. And then she got sick, isn't that correct, Priam?" Morton smiles at Priam.

"I saw the snot." Colee nods.

"Don't remind me, please!" Barbie finishes her meal.

"Well, she has a cold which will be gone in two or three days." Morton nods.

"How did you catch a cold, Priam?" Radium eats and stares at Priam.

"My hair was wet, when I slept in my bed." Priam nods.

"That sounds weird." Morton frowns.

"And my bed sheets were wet also." Priam nods.

"Were your bed sheet wet with water?"

"I mean they were not completely dry."

"How did that happen?"

"I...I spilled water on the bed sheets and then I slept on them, before I washed my hair and then I went to sleep and then I got sick."

"Her statement is too complicated for me." Barbie laughs.

"Dr. Demon can't solve that convoluted complex and complicated riddle." Morton chuckles.

"She has a cold." Preston nods with a smile and assists Priam to stand upright into his chest. They slowly back step from the side bench and scoot around the table, moving ahead towards the building. Priam continues to snuffle and sneeze from her common cold as Preston cuddles and warms her shivering body with love.

At the table, Barbie stands upright from the shared bench with her boyfriend Blaze, saying with a smile. "Okay. It's time for us to go back into the classroom." Each demon and angel leaves the table and moves back into the classroom for the rest of this heated afternoon.

From the school classroom, Priam slowly walks on the right side inside an energetic common hallway of vanilla paint with each yelling child, waddling toddler, busy teen, screaming mom, and quiet dad that travels in a different direction while preparing for the evening supper meal and all of the late night activities. She is skipping the evening supper meal with her friends Colee, Morton, Blaze, Barbie, Radium, and Preston. Her sore throat holds a string of yucky thick green colored mucus which clears out her runny nose and then skates down her raw esophagus dumping down into her two sick lungs within a tight chest cavity. Priam doesn't know where mucus finally ends and is not ignore to discover that either.

Thick green liquid tickles the lining of her nostrils causing a series of loud sneezes as and she feels her body grow warmer from each one of Preston's delicate heated angel touches. She desires rest inside his arms foreverly but that is not possible with Curfew at six pm.

Her supper meal will consist of saltine crackers and a pitcher of warm water inside her private bedroom with a good rest using her limited demon talents to heal her achy bones from the terrible bicycle accident three days ago. Her achy head contains a germy virus which had been acquired last night after sneaking out from the Demon Den, exiting the H Building and sleeping underneath the foundation crawlspace with puddles of wet sand and water and cold air.

Actually, Priam really desire to brag about her thrilling and scary personal encounter last night outside the building to her boyfriend Preston during the terrible thunder and lightning rain storm. Inside the hallway, a set of soft whispers echo off the wall from each angel and demon regarding last night's severe weather element, since the row of steel curtains with angel faces the ocean shoreline,

Each angel and demon can hear the roaring thunder above their hair roots and feel the sheets of heavy raindrops on top of the roof rafters but cannot see the sandy beach, where three tall shapes of unknown males stood and stared out at the ocean waves and they were not human either. They had possessed a pair of white colored wings like an angel and a demon.

They come.

Priam stops and opens her den door, entering inside the cozy room, sliding over the top of the bed mattress and coughs out loud. She swings her arm over the bed mattress and focuses on her wildly thoughts.

She has heard for many centuries the two words: They come. Priam has always thought "they" were a set of monsters with three heads, four arms, four feet, and colored purple like a monster from one of her nursery tales. Instead, they are a trio of unknown males with a pair of white wings.

On top of the bed, she reaches over and carefully pulls out a stack of the hidden parchments from underneath her bed pillow. Each demon room is private with a door lock, so no one can disturb her domain, but she is being cautious, because she had stolen the ancient papers from the hidden storage room.

Now, she possesses hard proof that a demon or an angel can live outside the building, after six pm briefly, after fighting off the rain, the thunder and the lighting

Now, Priam desires to go back outside again. She wants to study the trio of three males from a far and safe distance while hiding behind the row of thick dark green scrub bushes, again. They had not viewed her body until that lizard had scared her witless, jumping in her hair strands while causing her red colored demon aura to be exposed among the storm clouds for a brief period of time.

Her best working plan is hiding underneath the foundation tunnel space again, shifting the center placed scrub bush more towards the left side in front of the open access panel while creating a clear, but disguised larger peep hole. Then she can view and study the trio of the mysterious three males on the beach shoreline tonight. And she can watch and learn and take notes from her secret eyeball and eardrum research.

If she finds out enough important information about the three males, then she can defeat them or she can communicate with one of the males while uncovering what and who they are. Then she can ask kindly that they leave all the demons and angels alone here at the Key West military base. Then she and Preston can marry and live happily together foreverly.

Yeah, that's the new plan," she slides off the bed and slowly stands upright, feeling dizzy inside her achy head, exhaling some of the germs from her nose. She inhales slowly with fresh air that burns her raw esophagus. The fresh salt air and the bright sunlight will swiftly heal her body.

Priam slowly moves ahead and decides to heal your body and spy on the three unknown supernatural males tonight, stopping at the closed door and leans over into the smooth metal. She closes her eyelashes and listens with her demon hearing. The hallway is cleared from children, teens, and adults.

She reaches out and opens the door, peeking outside, looking in both directions. Clear! The hallway is empty and the time clock is 05:38 pm.

Priam stands upright and clears a nasty throat of dripping mucus, slowly moving ahead down an empty hallway with a stern face. Her mind creates numerous excuses inside the empty hallway and as she is outside her private bedroom, which also one of the many demon rules. She slowly strolls over the wooden floor and scans the hallway without seeing another angel or demon, turning the wall corner, seeing the open archway.

Inside the open archway, the solid steel door slowly drops down from the top and reaches the half-way mark moving down towards the floor.

Priam increases her pace and starts to race towards the open archway, looking back over her collar bone without seeing or hearing a person. She will not hide behind the machine gear box this time as she wants to feel the heated sunlight on her injured demon wings. Also, each demon and angel is tucking their scary body down into their bed mattress for the night.

She returns back with a laugh without dropping down, performing a body roll over the dirty floor, this time, either. She quickly bends down at her fitted waistline, dashing in a crouched pose underneath the row of jagged teeth on the steel door without injury. She races into the dull sunlight and sneezes out loud as her nasty nasal virus annoys and irritates her raw, sore throat which is almost healed from Preston's heated hands on her exposed forearm.

Preston is a strong angel and can supply his array of warm rays on her aching biological body, since it feels good to her cold bones. His radiant warmth destroys each one of her numerous bad germs inside the lingering cold virus within her blood veins. Preston also promises to hold her hand tomorrow giving more of his warmth touch also.

Outside the H Building, the skyline displays parted clouds, where numerous beams of heated sunlight bombard the sands and heat the air like usual here in Florida. The clouds are slowly starting to morph into a dark purple hue, without a single rain drop or a boom of loud thunder or a single bolt of lightning. So, the trio of three unknown males brings the vile and violent thunderstorm with them to the H Building when they arrive here a few seconds, after six pm.

She swiftly races ahead and in an upright pose with demon pride over the soft sand beside the tall, single row of light green scrub plants towards the fifteenth window pane, looking back over her collar bone at the sinking sun. The image is a duplicate from yesterday glowing in pink, red, blue, yellow, and orange rainbow colors among the pale blue skyline.

Priam halts and stands in front of the same tall scrub bush, the same hidden glass window, and the same steel curtains that covers Preston's private bedroom. Preston can't spot her body outdoors without ripping down the steel curtain with his bare hands or his angle power while violating Curfew, which he would never do.

And her open demon telepathy mind isn't receiving words or grunts from a single male or female voice there inside Preston's bedroom like last night.

Each steel curtain reinforces audio and visual protection for each demon and angel and is composed of some type of special earth alloys that she doesn't comprehend. However, Priam never pays attention during her academic lessons, only to Preston.

Right now, in front of row of scrub plants and the single steel curtain, Priam will ignore Preston and his busy evening immediately starting her new constructive project with a larger peep hole. She squats down on her two kneecaps and two palms, slowly crawling over the sand, scooting around the plant towards the metal grill. She finds the grill partially covered in sand inside the foundation tunnel.

No one here at the base has bothered to secure the metal gate back onto the foundation plate. She feels happy, because that object is very heavy. She doesn't look forward to moving heavy steel grill for as second with her delicate medical condition.

Her raw throat, runny nose, sore muscles, aching bones, and bruised tissues are barely healing around the sore and injured wing muscles on her body from the first encounter with steel which was three nights ago.

Priam is too sickly for her body to repair every ache and pain, immediately, possessing a limited range of demon healing talents. Preston explains during each one of her demon lesson sessions. Preston can heal his body in one night with rest and sleep and food.

The second requirement for a pair of healthy wings is exposure to the bright rays of sunshine and tons of fresh air for a proper healing, which has not happened for Priam, where she had slept last night within the cold air, over the dripping wet raindrops, and the darkness of night, laying inside a puddle of dirty water under the foundation tunnel until sunrise at six am.

The third requirement of wings is usage of transportation, defense, or escape.

Priam desires to inflate out her set of injured demon wings here on top of the sandy beach in the bright light and fresh air, before sleeping inside the foundation space again. However, Preston had strongly warned against that demon medical procedure, since some of the nosy demons would notice her colorful wing injuries and then would inquire. Thus her pair of demon wings has been slowly healing while tucked down inside her shoulders blades.

The fourth requirement of wings is the ability to miniaturize their size of her pinky finger.

On top of the sand, behind the scrub plant, Priam views the stationary and partially hidden metal grid. The grid position offers numerous excellent conclusions. No one has seen Priam. No one has reported the grill missing or moved. No one has seen the trio of unknown males on beach shoreline last night and maybe other nights during Curfew. Finally, no one can see or find her person here behind the row of scrub plants.

Also, each shallow puddle of rain water from the sheets of rain last night have all evaporated within the hot Florida heat at the 91 degrees in Fahrenheit air temperatures.

On top of the sand, behind the row of scrub plants, in front of the open access panel, Priam turns and examines the tiny peek hole through the thick entwinement of branches on the tall scrub bush that blocks ninety-eight percent of the sandy beach scene and ninety-nine percent of the pale blue skyline and one hundred percent of her demon spying. The high mathematical percentages equal a pair of blinded eyeball.

She back crawls from the scrub plant and halts inside the sandy soil, slowly standing upright from the sand, looking down at the tall scrub bush. She sneezes from the mucus build-in inside her raw throat, wiping a hand over her runny nose, slapping the same dirty hand over her dirty pair of walking shorts.

The scrub bush grows naturally upright from the golden sand with a circumference of three feet in length with a width of six feet composed of mostly elephant-sized pale green tinted leaves underneath Preston's steel curtain. The scrub bush is located slightly on the western side from the center entrance of the foundation crawlspace tunnel.

So, Priam brilliantly plans to shuffle the stationary scrub plant with her demon strength a little more in an easterly direction like the rush of some western winds has blown the pointy leaves across the white colored stucco black on the H Building.

She leans down and carefully hugs the center stem of the plant like a lover bending her kneecaps down into the prickly pale green colored pointy leaves and soil sand, swiftly jerking her strong limbs upwards while shaking some of the plant leaves toward her with much effort and little movement.

Her demon strength is not fully back at one hundred percent and as Priam has barely shifted the stationary plant towards an eastwardly direction from the stationary tall building, forming a larger peek hole for her spying eyeballs.

She exhales with pain and inhales a gulp of air, continuing to hug the plant, jerking it upward again with her two arms and two legs, without movement, for a second time. She sneezes over the plant leaves and then slowly standing upright, exhaling with pain. She parks both hands on her waistline, inhaling fresh air, exhaling with a cough all the bad germs in the air waves. The dang plant is stubborn and stronger than her demon body.

She thoroughly examines the root system consisting of number branch limbs and large elephant-sized green tinted leaves that completely block her peek hole and then squats down the sand, studying the root system on the single scrub plant. The root system forks into two stems as the larger stem grows in an eastern direction. The smaller stem root flows over the sand in a westerly direction in front of the steel grill.

Priam can jerk out the smaller stem from the main root system coming out form the sandy ground and then re-position each branch limb with all the associated green tinted plant leaves while creating and disguising a new larger peek hole.

On top of the sand, she reaches down and digs with her fingers, scooping out the excess sand away from the root system, exposing the green colored plant skin in the air. Now, she has alleviated the pull-stress on her two hands from the packed sand around the root stem.

She slowly back crawling away from the bush and exhales with pain, slowly standing upright from the sand, willingly her mind to mentally shift the scrub bush to the side, instead of using her hands and strength. The scrub plant does not move. Because that feat is an angel talent, in which, a demon like her doesn't possess.

She folds over at her fitted waist and bends her kneecaps for support, adding additional physical arm muscle strength, grabbing the central limb with both hands. She swiftly jerks the root stem upright from the sand with major failure, huffing in painful effort, releasing the root stem with both hands. Priam stares at the scrub bush which is more stubborn than before.

Priam desperately needs a boost of extra demon power in her arms and her body. Her pair of wings can provide that needed boost of strength. Her wings had been formed from birth on every angel and demon. The development of the wings is based on the height and weight of the individual life form. Priam is five feet and two inches in height and weighs 95 pounds and two ounces on her petite demon body frame.

Wings span is calculated by the total footage of height plus half of the arm length times the mathematical number of five, so the arm length on Priam is 2.5 feet and one inch or 31 total inches. When you all the add numbers together, her pair of demon wings measures 5 feet and one inch plus the 2 feet and one inch which is multiplied the mathematical number five which equals a total amount of 217 inches or 18 feet and .08 inches as the tiny sub-inches count towards the array of loose and worn wing feathers.

The strength, within either an angel or demon wings carries their full body weight of the owner by three times as Priam is 95 pounds. When multiplied by three, the sum equals 285 pounds of torque within her pair of demon wings making Priam's strength equivalent with a single defensive lineman on any football team or a fully equipped motorcycle or a fat farm mule.

On top of the sand, in front of the stubborn, stationary scrub bush, Priam expands and then explodes her pair of demon wings into full view that displays an ugly, creepy appearance against the white tinted stucco block. She coughs out loud from the cold and cringes in pain from the swift explosion of her wings, reaching up, rubbing the weaker left collar bone. The right wing emerges with a strong beautiful arch that lifts upward towards the heaven, lingering over her rear bone skull as the wing tip runs down even with her kneecap and continues to flow downward towards her toe bones in coral hue. Her right healthy wing twinkles on each feathered tip with a touch of white hue.

All wings are red colored for an angel and a demon.

Her demon wings aren't colored in red hue yet. Preston reminds every hour that Priam current is a teenage demon, when she finally matures into a demon adult, her pair of wings will grow stronger and darken into a dark red hue like his pair.

Her left wing badly droops down starting at the highest arch tip, exposing the layer of naked skin without her coral and white fluffy feather or numerous dead and black colored feathers which are slowly dropping off from the hair follicle in pain. The injured demon wing hangs down and constantly slams into her collar bone bouncing back and then back down like a dead bird on top of tree limb.

Three evenings ago, before the Curfew hour, Prima had missed the main entrance door into the H Building that housed each demon and angel members for safety. Then she had found new shelter, slamming half of her body into a partially closing steel door, tilting to the right side inside the open space. Her head, one side of her body including one wing successfully entered the safe space, not the other half of her body. Her left wing had smashed into the steel frame on the closing door, spilling out heated blood proteins, ripping off naked skin tissue and healthy coral tinted feathers from her injured body, finally landing down on the floor in blood, tears, and safety during Curfew.

A demon wing does not break as the limb is made from tough skin extending out from the biological body which is similar to four tough hoofs on a horse.

The horse hoof is an extension like a human toenail, except the hoof is strong, durable, hard, resistant to natural and some man-made elements and impossible to break, unless the hoof is directly battered with a sharp weapon of abuse.

A demon or angel wing is tough, flexible, soft, breathable, and resistant to elements of wind, snow, rain, heat, and lightning bolts. Each feather provides chemical warmth and biological strength as the limb absorbs the natural elements of bright sunrays and clean fresh air. Each pair of wings are also unique in color, texture, strength, and dimensions to an angel or a demon such like a set of fingerprints on a human.

A wing can break, if it is weakened and then cut by a sharp instrument like a sword. It can be torn from the owner with any wickedly force coming from another supernatural being that possesses greater strength of torque within their physical body of height and weight, such like, Preston measures six feet and six inches in height and possesses over 23 feet of wing span and 666 pounds of body strength.

No life form will ever harm him!

On top of the sand, in front of the stubborn and stationary scrub plant, Priam slowly rolls up the right collar bone and shoulder muscle while inflating her healthy right wing outwards stimulating a pretend demon flight through the air.

She pulls her injured left wing towards the middle on her back spine and maintains an equal balance on upright body. One healthy wing and one injured wing can supply the additional demon force strength which is needed to jerk the tall stubborn, stationary scrub bush out from its cozy resting spot.

On top of the sand, in front of the bush, she slowly folds down at her fitted waistline and with both kneecaps, digging both of her booted feet deeper down into the sandy ground while supporting her tilted body. She exhales out with more bad germs from her parted lips and reaches down, clutching the center portion on the naked root, curling all of her finger pads around the rounded thick stem. She inhales a deep breath and then exhales more bad germs through her parted lips, inhaling a deep gulp of fresh salt air and holds the sour taste inside her closed lips, swiftly jerking upward using all of her demon strength as the plant swiftly yanks upward and shuffles sideways, leaving its cozy sand pit, resting inside her two cupped palms.

Priam rapidly shuffles backward from her demon force and continue to tote the scrub plant within both hands, quickly lifting up her body two feet in height from the sandy ground with panic, holding an air-born pose for .02 milliseconds. She stalls during a short non-flight procedure and violently wobbles side to side out of control, spinning around in a half-circle, flying blindly backwards into the smooth part on the H Building. She hit her back spine, both shoulder muscles, both expanded wings, and the rear part on her hairy skull against the smooth blocks, dropping the plant to the sand, falling downwards toward the sandy ground in front of the building.

Her entire body quickly falls downward from the stalled air-borne pose two feet in height and as she lands on her fanny first, bouncing both of her wings and her back spine for a second time into the hard rows of white colored stucco blocks, finally resting with a pair of outstretched legs beside the scrub plant. She loudly moans in pain and sits on top of the sand creating a series of tiny whirlwinds of golden sand dust that surrounds her upper body and covers her distorted face. Her rear skull pops again the stucco building, causing dizziness within her eyeballs and as she loudly grunts with more body pain.

The skyline swiftly morphs from part pale blue hue into an angry blackish-purple tone as booms of loud thunder clouds loudly roars through the air wave and throngs of colorful blue, yellow, and white lightning bolts dances across dark angry clouds.

"They come!" Priam whispers in panic and pain, slowly opening her two eyelashes, seeing at first double vision over the landscape, sitting on top of the sand both exposed and dizzy in between the empty spot on the row of light green scrub plants. She slowly blinks both eyelids a few times and views an angry skyline, without the rain or thunder or lightning bolts and then grunts out loud in pain and panic again.

In front of the building and the exposed spot on the row of scrub plants, she slowly rolls sideways away from the plant and lands flat down on her stomach, slowly deflating each one of her injured demon wings down into a pair of finger-sized objects, painfully returning the tiny wings back down into a pair of bloody and sore back muscles. She uses both hands as a pair of scooping cups, digging her set of manicured fingernails down into the soft sand, slowly dragging her horizontal aching body and dizzy headache over the rough sand toward the safety of the deep foundation crawlspace for both protection and fear.

They come.

She continues to dig out numerous shallow holes with her fingernails down into the sand and slowly moves her body towards the entrance of the tunnel, tucking both of her kneecaps into her chest, elevating the dead weight of her dead a few inches from the sandy soil for a faster retreat from the outside thunderstorm elements. Her two booted feet quickly kicks forward and as her head and upper body clears the access panel opening, moving deeper inside the foundation crawlspace. When her booted feet scoot through the opening, she halts in place and slowly swings around, staring at beach.

She has torn the hypodermis right below the skin on each one of her injured wings. The demon hypodermis attaches to the underlying bone and muscle on each shoulder blade and the back spine which contains rows of blood vessels and finely tuned nerve endings for touch. Her wings aren't actually aching. It is the loose connective tissues that surrounds her damaged muscle tissues which ache as she has stained the elastic fibroblasts, macrophages, and adipocytes along her curvy back spine.

The hypodermis contains fifty percent of her body fat, since the body fat serves as a source of padding and insulation from the cold and heated weather elements on her demon body. Priam possesses a slender body frame in weight as a sixteen-year-old teen in demon years. Thus, her body fat doesn't need to be stretched out again.

When the demon fat is low plus each fibroblast, macrophage, and adipocyte are strained, the outer skin surface becomes re-colonized with a set of nasty dirty bacteria inside each one of the embedded feather follicle, where the torn wound opening resides.

Right now, Priam can easily acquire a deadly infection inside each one of her wings without proper bed rest and medical care. Now, she can't leave the safety of the foundation crawlspace and contact Preston at his steel curtain for help either.

On top of the dirty sand, inside the foundation crawlspace, Priam continues to rest on top of her stomach with her two wings nicely tucked down but painfully stored inside her back muscles, wiping off the wet blood from her busted lips, after biting down on her tongue. She wipes more wet blood from her nostrils and both of her eardrums, after impacting her hard skull against the harder stucco blocks. She closes her eyelids and quickly performs a demon healthy assessment on her bodily injuries.

Starting from the bottom of her body, the toes, both feet, both legs, both thighs, her fit waistline, chest cavity, both arms, both hands, and all of her fingers are healthy. She feels intense throbs of pain coming from her left shoulder blade that travels straight across the back spine into her right shoulder blade. The intense pain continues down vertically her curvy back spine into both of her tiny stored wings as her expanded wings have taken the brunt of the violent impact into the hard stucco blocks again.

She feels slightly dizzy when her body is compared with the intensive throb pain coming from both of her shoulder muscles as the ache is overwhelming her nervous system. And her usually solid demon aura of red hue has become shaking and quakes in broken rows of stressed reflections and as she feels suddenly cold from the new fridge air temperatures on the Florida beach.

They come.

On top of the dirty sand, inside the safety of the underground foundation crawlspace on H Building, Priam continues to rest on her stomach and as her mind clicks. She smiles with a painful victory. Her demon plan has worked perfectly on that stubborn and stationary scrub plant in front of the open access panel which no longer blocks her eyeball view for spying. She views a sandy beach and a skyline of black clouds. The calm wind swiftly increases and blows numerous sands grains across the air waves with hurricane portions. Thunder loudly booms throughout the dark clouds. And vertical and horizontal streaks of blue, yellow and white tinted bolts of individual lightning dances within the rolling blackish-purple clouds.

06:02:14 p.m.

On top of the golden sandy beach, in front of the smooth waves from a calm ocean water, a trio of tall and mysterious males do not exist there tonight.

They don't come.

Inside the safety of the foundation crawlspace, Priam quickly brushes her sweaty face and strands of plastered hair on one wet cheekbone as the hurricane winds playfully slap numerous strands of her black colored hair away into her two eyeballs. She brushes back the annoying strands of messy hair without feeling her softness from her golden satin ribbon.

Outside on top of the sand, the sheets of rain halts but the loud thunder clouds boom and the bolts of lightning continue to dance across the dark skyline in both beauty and angry.

Inside the safety of the foundation crawlspace, Priam gasps in alarm and sits upright on both of her elbows in the soft sand, scanning the surrounding grounds for her ribbon, pulling up her chest cavity from the sand and then slowly crawls over the soil expanding her search. Her body pain quickly ascends ugly through each one of her joints, muscles, tissues, organs, and row of blood veins, if that is even possible on a demon life form.

Her pair of eyeballs burns from each flying sharp sand grain and every torn piece from a destroyed plant bush within the terrible storm, spotting her precious golden tinted satin ribbon outside the tunnel entrance on top of the wet sand grains and a few inches from open door frame.

She slowly moves ahead from the tunnel on both of her elbows and drags a pair of aching legs through the semi-dry sandy ground, halting in front of the open door frame without exposing her upper body. She reaches out with one hand and tries to snatch up the satin ribbon, scraping the wet sand grains instead. Her upper body is buried too deeply inside the foundation crawlspace for a tiny rescue of her precious ribbon.

Do not lose that ribbon!

Tomorrow morning, Preston will immediately notice the missing item from her hair roots and then will seriously question the location of that missing possession. The golden ribbon was a gift from him a very long time ago. Priam had worn the ribbon first as a girly ponytail and now as teenage headband.

Inside the safety of the foundation crawlspace, Priam slowly inches ahead over the wet sand and exposes her black colored hair roots and her collar bone outside the open door frame, slamming her arm down towards the wet sand, grabbing the wet ribbon. She hauls the ribbon back into her chest and fiddles with the satin within her two hands, eventually creating a girly bow on the right side of her face near the earlobe, securing the precious gift until she can wash her hair and change her wet clothing tomorrow morning at 06:00:01.

At the western edge, on the H Building, the trio of unknown males had landed down during the thunderstorm behind the rear structure tonight, instead in front of the calm ocean waves while searching the rear landscape first. Each one veers in a different geographical direction while covering more of the sandy landscape in speed and silence.

The tall, black haired male slowly moves ahead from the rear landscape beside the side exterior wall, heading towards the beach shoreline and continues to search the ground landscape for that tiny flash of bright light. He stops and stands at the corner wall with a stern face, scanning the landscape with flat sands, a long row of wooden picnic tables, plots of manicured grass, and a long row of plant bushes.

He had seen that flash of light last night among the single line of pale green Florida scrub bushes while experiencing mysterious, intrigue and curiosity.

Then he catches with split second speed a new bright light noting that something has returned back here tonight too.

He turns with a smile and races ahead in front of the building, skidding to a halt beside a single damaged scrub brush. Someone or something has tampered with the poor innocent scrub plant destroying numerous parts of the stem, the leaves, and the root system. He lifts up on his tippy toes and peeks over the damaged scrub plant, seeing an entrance hole that leads into the foundation's crawlspace. His eyeballs darts down to the sandy ground and studies a set of weird animal prints with caution.

Inside the safety of the foundation crawlspace, Priam continues to rest on her stomach and loudly sneezes from her nasty head cold.

In front of the damaged scrub plant, the male falls down onto the wet sand on both kneecaps and bends both of his elbows, dropping down his face down and stares into the dark void. He views a clear hole through the twisted limbs on the damaged plant and spots the single object. "There you are." He greets with a friendly bass drum and views a hidden female inside the crawlspace.

"No." Priam softly whispers with fear and continues to rest on top of the sand, seeing the crouched pose on the unknown male. He is one from the trio of unknown males from yesterday. The male possesses a cropped head of black colored wavy hair, a pair of intense teal-blue eyeballs and a rose-beige tinted face, smiling back at her.

Outside on top of the wet sand in between the empty space of scrub plants, the male wiggles a hand and shuffles the tall damaged scrub plant away from the opening with his supernatural magic, extending the same arm into the dark tunnel, touching her collar bone with his index finger pad. His unknown magic freezes her body but not her mind.

Inside the crawlspace, Priam magically lifts up a few inches from the wet sand and floats forward in the air with his touch talents.

He slowly shuffles backward on his kneecaps and steers a horizontally posed Priam safely out from the tunnel. The unknown dark haired male possesses a set of strong and powerfully supernatural telekinesis talents that is working on her frozen form by touching any part of her body and then paralyzing temporarily her demon powers.

Priam slowly exits through his magical levitation out from the dark tunnel still a frozen state into the open skyline of loud thunder booms and streaks of colorful lightning bolts without the sheets of raindrops.

Her body condition is both weakened from her cold virus and hurt from her numerous body injuries, allowing the unknown supernatural male to touch and then manipulate her frozen body this way. Else, Priam will be fighting with him for her freedom, once she clears the opening and he releases from his supernatural gripe. Then she will be fight for him to death.

The male stumbles backward over his glowing white colored unpolished cowboy boots and then kneecaps down in the wet sand with a deep chuckle without releasing his magical touch, gliding her safely through the small opening and away from the rows of sharp pointy leaves on each Florida scrub plant. Then her frozen horizontal form gently lands down on top of the wet sand beyond the safety of the building, Preston's steel covered glass window, and the row of scrub bushes at his kneecaps like a peasant.

The male immediately releases his supernatural touch and jerks his index finger pad in the air, slowly standing upright from the sand and standing over a frozen and ground Priam, extending an arm down to her face.

Priam continues to rest over the wet sand and sneers at his hand, shaking her curls, struggling painfully on top of her elbows. She stands on her kneecaps and exhales a series of heavy sour breaths from her healthy lungs while feeling intense pain coming from each one of her minor and major body injuries. She shuffles and plants one boot on top of the sand, shifting the other boot, slowly standing but bending down at her fit waistline from her headache dizziness and other body pains. Then with her demon determination, Priam slowly uprights into five feet and two inches of shortness, staring at the six feet plus unknown male, growling her demon girly warning.

He continues to stand and extends his hand saying a grin and a smooth bass tone, "Come with me."

"No!" Priam continues to stand and study the delicate situation, shouting out loud in panic and fear as she waves both of her arms in the air, warning him of her secret demon skills that can kill any life form.

He continues to stand very close in front of her face and reaches out grabbing both of her flinging hands in the air and pulls her body into his chest, rumbling in a smooth bass timber. "Come with me, please." He smiles handsomely at the young girl.

"No! No! No! Let me go." Priam wiggles side to side and screams out loud in terror, tugging at her bounded hands within his warm finger pads. She quickly exposes and then inflates her pair of coral tinted demon wings into full beautiful height, cringing in pain with a soft moan of fear.

The left arch on her demon wing droops down over her collar bone as the wing tip tilts underneath her left kneecap from all the numerous injuries and encounters with steel and stucco hard man-made objects. She seriously needs to break away from the warm but strong hand gripe on the tall, strong, healthy and mysterious handsome supernatural male.

She takes flight and flaps with only her healthy right wing, slowly rising upward from the sand using all of her demon strength as the male continues to hold her cold finger pads arching his arms into the air. If Priam can get airborne, then she can escape and hide inside the grove of shaggy pine trees behind the H Building waiting until sunrise at six am with the rescue from her loving, caring, overprotective boyfriend Preston.

He continues to stand on top of the wet sand and holds her hands. "You're hurt!" He gasps in shock and stares at her drooping left wing, wearing a pair of worried teal-blue eyeballs and a set of soft pink lips.

"Release me!" Priam sneers and viciously flaps her one wing in flight in the air waves, without success.

The unknown male beautifully explodes a pair of twenty-two feet, white tinted wings as each feather is colored in alternating gold and electric blue hue which surrounded by a thick outline of glittering gold down to his two wing tips. He slowly lifts up from the sand and carefully flies parallel with her floating body moving up into the nasty clouds, swishing his pair of wings one time for a lift and then a hover.

The hurricane winds has ceased as the air temperature quickly warm up with heated elements and the thunder boom stops.

Priam floats in the air five feet in height from the wet sand and slowly ascends toward the heaven, if the unknown male would let go of her bound hands.

"Come to me, Prims." He continues to hold her hands and nods with a smile, handsomely.

"No! No! No! Let me go! I don't wanna go with you," she sneers and struggles with her hands from his gripe. Priam swiftly flaps her single right wing, drawing more strength and greater speed to break the powerful hold from the unknown male as each swish of her single wing seriously drums a set of searing tiny needles of pain in between her pair of hairy eyebrows, riding her back spine on each nerve ending and moves down into her toenails. she sobs in pain and moans in fear as a capture of the unknown male without a rescue from her boyfriend Preston, who is safely locked inside his angel room in the H Building.

The male tightens his manly gripe around her set of cold, numb finger pads, shuffling gracefully beside her flight path in the blue sky, soaring higher from the wet sand. "I can help you. You're hurt. Your wing is damaged. Please, let me help you, Prims." He continues to nod and smiles at her.

"No!" She sneers and struggles for freedom from the unknown male, slowly sailing higher up in the air and further from the solid wet sand with danger.

"Well, then, I'll come to you." He chuckles with a goofy smile.

The male slowly curves both of his wing tips from his back spine and moves them around his body, advancing towards Priam while shifting the wind currents in the atmosphere around his body. He slowly creates a concave shape with his pair of golden tinted wings as his slick maneuver swiftly sucks up all the air currents like a household vacuum cleaner and draw each object to and then around his air-borne body.

One of these objects is an air-borne and injured Priam.

The swirling force from the gathering air currents surround both her air-borne body and her expanded and injured demon wings as the current flows toward the male, producing a drag on her single healthy fluttering right wing, causing Priam to fall directly down into his open arms.

He chuckles with a grin at Priam.

The more she pumps her healthy demon wing, the more she stalls in flight, and the more she tumbles faster down towards the unknown male.

He frowns with worry, "Prims, let me comfort you."

"No! No. No! Get away from me! I don't like you," Priam fights against the depleting warm air currents feeling weak, rapidly falling down into his happy embrace.

Skin is an outer cover on a human. Skin underneath a wing on a demon provides a different purpose, since a pair of demon wings protects the body against pathogens and water loss. The wings also function as warm or cold insulation, temperature regulation, air sensation, and a deadly weapon composing multiple layers of ectodermic soft tissue and hard muscles without hard breakable bone, twistable soft ligaments or soft internal organs that could be damaged or destroyed unlike a human boy.

The set of soft demon feathers provides warmth, insulation, beauty and acts as a magnet to other demon or angel feathers. The two curved wings on the unknown male beautifully touch her wings on outer edges of her coral tinted feathers creating a bright orange colored magnetic moment in present time over the wet golden tinted sands, in the warm air, and below the calm greenish-blue ocean waves.

In Earth science, a magnet is the force that pulls all ferromagnetic materials and creates an electron field or an invisible shell which attracts or repels other magnets. The magnetic moment is a vector field that represents the southern and northern opposite ends or sides on the magnet or a magnetic object which influences the overall magnetic properties of strength, direction, and orientation.

Among the warm air temperatures in the black clouds, on her expanded pair of demon wings, the southern wing tip on her left side, lovingly or dangerously, is attracted to the right side on his southern wingtip and as her other damaged wing duplicates the same process and tickling sensation on the opposite side as a slow-forming concave shape curves and electrifies a semi-circular balance between the two objects, which is also known as the magnetic flux.

The magnetic flux is located in-between the empty space an enclosed electron shell which is composed of organized atoms with individual tiny ferromagnetic particles, holding magically any and all man-made or nature objects as each tiny particle composed of lead, zinc, copper, brass, nickel, iron, aluminum, and other earthy metals floating around the air atmosphere which are tiny invisible particle scattered inside the space between her pair of demon wings.

Inside the warmth of the supernatural concave, her two eyelashes slowly open wide and then close shut feeling safe, security and comfort and as her active mind recalls from the science lesson from Preston, not one of the long boring academic sessions at the local high school classroom inside the H Building or any other human structure.

A magnet produces a magnetic field with its own reserve materials. Most materials produce their own magnetic field which is called magnetism. The overall magnetic behavior on a piece of material can vary depending upon the structure of the object and the electron configuration.

The earth mineral iron is a strongly attracted to any magnet or magnetic field.

Aluminum, platinum and oxygen molecules inside each natural earth minerals are weakly attracted to a magnet or magnetic field.

The substances of carbon, copper, water, and man-made plastics are repelled by a magnet or a magnetic field, which are labeled as diamagnetic items. However, a super strong earth magnetic can attract and then levitate tiny pieces of lead particles and even a few small tan and white colored beach mice in the air and around the vector field.

Note: A beach mouse exists and lives only in the coastal sand dune areas. Each one of the tiny tan and white colored mice burrows and nests in the dunes and are active at night, sleeping during the day. The tiny rodents eat and live off plant seeds and small insects on the beach sands.

Inside the warmth of the glowing electric blue concave, Priam gasps in alarm and as one of her open eyelashes views three tiny white colored sea mice four feet up from the sand that permanently dangle in the warm air waves near his left kneecap. Each tiny mouse is alive and wiggles its tiny four feet back and forth in puzzlement with their sudden super flying rodent abilities which comes from the unknown powerful supernatural male.

But a developing or stationary glowing magnetic field cannot be demagnetized. Priam recalls within her sleep mind all of Preston's survival lessons for a young demon.

An extreme heated and hot shield around the affected host body destroys the individual magnetic molecules and then melts away the shared vector field from the enemy body, if you are standing next to the solar sun and then become slammed by one of the numerous solar sun flares.

That's not going to happen right here and right now, to Priam!

Shoving the organic magnetic away from the linear part on the second quadrant on the B-H curve of the magnetic material will demagnetize the vector field. Or shove the unknown male away from her face using her demon powers.

Yeah, that's not going to happen right here and right now, for Priam, either!

A hammering effect using all of her limbs creates a mechanical perturbment or disturbance that will randomize the magnetic domain for a quick escape from the annoying organic magnet.

Yeah, that's not going to happen right here and right now, with Priam, either!

If an external magnetic field accidentally or purposefully interacts on human tissue, then the unlucky human will become deathly sick with radiation poisoning or create a set of new cancer cells. However, on a demon or angel body, an external magnetic moment feels peaceful harmony and is harmless on the affected host body coming from a shared vector field.

When the demon, as an organic magnet, loses their individual body properties, their magnetic field swiftly collapses away from the affected host body. Their protective and invisible electromagnetic shell which is not viewed by a pair of non-human or human eyeballs dissolves into nothingness and leaves the affected host body both exposed and vulnerable with a death kill or a permanent injury.

The unknown tall and dark haired male slowly shapes his 22 feet of expanded wings into a loose concave formation glowing inside a blue colored electron shell around an air-borne, frozen, and an unshielded Priam, forming an outer protective golden tinted magnet cocoon, hugging her body, including both of her arms, both dangling legs, both injured wings, and her two booted feet, only her pretty face is seen by his naked eyeballs.

The word magnet also represents a person or a thing that has a powerful attention also.

"Relax, Prims. Feel the warmth." He protectively comforts her body and rumbles in a deep bass timber with a smile of happiness.

On Planet Earth, the insect cocoon lives inside a protective case of spun silk material by the moth caterpillar covering the young pupa as currently Priam is young pupa here inside the concave formation.

"You're safe, Prims. I won't harm you. I'm here too protective you," He chuckles with a smile and watches her inside his newly created cocoon shell of glowing gold.

The insect's silky cocoon consists of many different properties including toughness, softness, opaque colors with multiple layers of larval hairs inside the enclosed cocoon shell that provides protection and sweet comfort for the young pupa.

First touch from each one of his wing feathers inside the concave formation feels silky soft and warmth surrounding and enclosing her cold, sore, and bloody demon body and her pair of inflated damaged wing. His concave formation emits heated protection from twirling cool air temperatures that bombard the warm air currents and comfort to her aching hard bones and soft flesh with numerous injuries and dried bloody patches.

On Planet Earth, some of the insect larvae attach a series of small twigs, fecal pellets, and pieces of vegetation to the exterior cocoon attempting to disguise the shell from each deadly predator.

The striking gold and electric blue color makes her mind dizzy as the swirling patterns of vertical lines continue to embrace and close around Priam, relaxing her anxious thoughts with escape and then her sweet freedom from the unknown male. Her body badly responds to her mental commands from her numb brain cells.

On Planet Earth, the pupating insect inside the enclosed cocoon must escape by cutting its way out as some cocoons are constructed with a built-in tear away line from the inside or an exit hole within the one-way passage for their freedom out from their similar concave shape.

Priam can't see an exit hole or one single weakness within his pair of soft, fluffy golden colored wings and as her mind and her body becomes engulfed with his warm heat and his silky soft electric blue colored feathers that gently touch and stroke her tired, sore, and achy wings. She closes her eyelashes and stops her struggle, allowing his blanket of feathery warmth to embrace her tired body.

"No escape, Prims." He sniggers with a smirk and stares her newly created concave formation, still floating in the air by swishing each wing with balance and without flight or fight on the young female.

On top of the wet sands, in front of the row of damaged scrub plants, on the exterior wall of the H Building, one of the steel curtains rattles with action and then rapidly breaks apart from the exposed glass window, revealing an angry face on Preston and as he stands helplessly behind the glass pane inside his private angel room inside the building structure, staring at his girlfriend Priam and the tall, black-haired male.

Outside in the warm air temperatures and dark skyline with gently winds, the unknown male slowly lands down and stands on top of the wet golden sands, holding an unconscious and cuddled Priam inside his warm concave shape composed of his electric blue tinted glowing wings, which is similar to a butterfly cocoon, using his magnetic flux that glows in gold hue. He darts his two eyeballs away from a sleeping Priam and views the exposed glass window and as the tall and black-haired unknown male smiles with a wink and shouts out loud the familiar name at the familiar male, "Preston."

Then, they disappear.

Priam opens her eyelashes and stares with a pair of turquoise tinted irises down into a soft white colored satin pillowcase. Her horizontal body comfortably rest on top of a soft mattress, conforming to her chest, waistline, and two legs and as her back spine is facing the climate elements inside an unfamiliar room with the sweeping hot air particles floating above her sleepy head. Her back spine feels warm and cozy underneath a pile of thick white colored blankets.

Her old demon room had been painted in dull gray hue matching the gray steel cot and clean gray sheets.

Her active eyeballs shift sideways and stare down at numerous sunbeams dancing on a wooden floor as bright sunlight is bright invades the unfamiliar room also. She closes her eyelids while her irises adjust to the illuminated sunrays and then slowly opens her eyelashes, seeing more of the unfamiliar room.

She confirms her body position resting flat on top of the soft bed mattress with numerous blankets over her naked neck muscles, traveling all the way down towards her two booted feet, sniffing out loud. She smells a lovely fragrance of vanilla scent and a field of tall yellow tinted sunflowers that float in the air currents.

She slowly shifts her face and views the opposite wall inside the unfamiliar room, enjoying the warm bed covers while not desiring to move from her bed cocoon of heavy blankets.

On top of the wooden floor, in the middle of the unfamiliar room, a small female child wears a white sleeveless long dress and a pair of white tinted wings that expand into two feet which are outline in lavender hue. The center of her expanded wings contains a pattern of tiny spirals that are intermingled with pink and yellow hues similar to a painted portrait of pretty flowers dried on a canvas. She displays a head of strawberry blonde colored hair pulled into a pair of wiggling piggy tails on each side of her bone skull. The small child quietly sits cross-legged on top of the floor exposing her two pale colored kneecaps from underneath the folded skirt hem. Her two pale colored ankle bones are wrapped individually with a white long ribbon and attached to an individual flat ballerina slipper that cover her naked toes. The mysterious winged child smiles with a pair of happy eyeballs meeting for first time Priam.

On top of the bed mattress, Priam blinks in silence and doesn't recognize the child's face while knowing every demon child inside the Demon Den back at the Florida Key West Naval military base. However, Priam isn't located here inside the Demon Den. She somehow has traveling to a new place with that unknown black-haired, winged male.

She has been taken away from the Florida military base and her boyfriend Preston sobbing with tears in fear, frustration, and fright, desiring to go back home to her Demon Den and Florida.

In the warm bed mattress, on top of the pillow, Priam slowly adjusts her face high in the air and slowly pulls her torso up as the pile of blankets slowly shifts down toward her waistline. Priam slowly moves each one of her limbs while feeling rows of intensive pain coupled with her emotional sadness and girly depression, needing to maintain a level head and a calm demeanor within her new delicate situation.

Right now, her mental brain is quickly developing a brilliant plan to escape into freedom and then return back to Preston and her Demon Den.

She feels a series of ugly shooting pains starting at her naked neck muscles moving across both of her bruised collar bones, riding down through her stationary body, landing down at her toenails. The throbbing pain confirms a torn hypodermis below the underneath skin on each one of her injured demon wings, attaching to the underlying bone, the muscle tissue on each shoulder blades, etc. and etc. and etc.

She exhales with worry and cringes in pain slowly shuffling each leg underneath the pile of blankets, curling them into her chest, supporting her upper body. She stands upright on her palms and kneecaps, grunting in pain. Her head is dizzy and as her skin feels the patches of dry, itchy blood proteins inside and outside her nostrils and over parts of her exposed skin. Priam turns a face and views the girl, who is gone.

Perfectly normal, the little winged demon child is a spy person that has been assigned to spy on Priam, who has completed her spy job reporting back to her supreme leader.

Inside the unfamiliar room, on top of the soft mattress, Priam slowly rolls off the bed in pain and slowly stands upright in more pain, facing a window that displays a bright beautiful sunny day, letting each heated ray warm her beaten and battered demon body and her pair of aching wings.

She quickly surveys the room seeing a high ceiling, a long wooden floor, a row of tall and wide glass windows, and finally an arched doorway with a closed and locked wooden door. The room is huge in size when it is compared to her tiny den room. The room also houses a low-lying light colored wooden bed frame without a decorative headboard and footboard on the side wall of windows, the only piece of furniture inside the almost empty and enclosed space.

A prisoner doesn't get much here.

No other furniture pieces occupy the empty space in between three walls of glass and one wall of solid wood with an entrance door. No food items exist on the floor or the bed mattress. No eating table for a food tray exists. No sitting chair stands for a visitor either. And no other demons are present, but Priam.

She giggles at her silly mental thoughts.

The room circumference measures forty feet long by forty feet wide by forty in height comprising three walls of clear glass windows coming down from the ceiling planks towards the flat floor planks showing tightened packed groves of green and brown shade trees, rows of fruit-bearing plant bushes, and colored pods of wildflowers embedded down in a pink tinted soil.

Priam slowly exercises her two wings up and then down while cringing in pain. The friendly warmth and rays of sunshine from the row of tall glass windows attack and then engulf both of her injured wings healing the tissues, feathers and skin fast. She stares through the windows and views a pretty landscape while plotting an awesome escape as her pair of damaged demon wings reacts with rows of violently trembles from the natural heated light. Right now, her awesome escape will have to be postponed until tomorrow morning at dawn.

Priam slowly bends down at her fitted waistline and bows to the window letting the sunrays blisters from the glass window onto her destroyed wings as the heat fairies dance in bright light over her injured body. Her two eyeballs stare down at the new and unfamiliar landscape of colorful floral, pink desert, tall spruce trees and rows of short pale green plant bushes. Priam has lived throughout the world over the past years with Preston as a young demon.

On the entrance wall of light wood, the locked matching wooden door opens and then slams against the side wall, creating a loud boom inside the quiet room.

On top of the floor, beside the bed frame, in front of the row of glass windows, Priam swiftly spins around to face the music as the human like to quote. Numerous life forms quickly invade her imprisoned private room two by two through the wide open archway.

Priam studies each one of her new foes. Each foe halts with a stern face and stands in a horizontal row in front of her, standing in a fighting en guard position with a pair of inflated wings in white hue that exhibits a unique pattern of colored symbols over each one of fluffy feathers.

An older male in the middle of the row standing at six feet and eight inches in height and 23 feet of wings displays a head of curly white colored hair, a pair of greenish-blue twinkling eyeballs, saying with a tenor timber and stares at Priam, "Is she hurt? Did those vile creatures hurt my little cupcake?"

"No, sir!" An alto voice comes from an unfamiliar older female and as she stands beside the older male, measuring five feet and six inches in height with a pair of 19 foot inflated wings. An outline of soft yellow surrounds the edges of her wings with a random patter of medium-sized raindrop shapes covering the front and back of her feathery wings. Each individual raindrop shape glitters in hues of red, yellow, blue, green, and orange. Her bone skull displays bright red tinted cropped hair behind a pair of big earlobes in white skin tone and holds a round shaped white tinted leather bag in one hand. She loudly coughs and then covers her parted lips with a free hand, gagging on a string of thick mucus that flows back down her tight throat, loudly sneezing. She wipes the runny snot from one nose hole with a wet lady handkerchief using her magic underneath her two nostrils and frowns at Priam.

In the row of dangerous foes, a tenor voice shouts out loud with joy and as the older male smiles at Priam wiggling his fingers, slowly stomping ahead while desiring to touch or embrace the young girl, "There are you, cupcake!" He stops and then lightly coughs out loud following by a single loud sneezes, wiping the clear mucus with both cupped hands then cleans the dirty hands down on his leather trousers.

In front of the row of glass windows, Priam slowly scoots around the bed frame with a demon sneer and hits her leg into the low bed post, slowly back stepping away from the row of unfamiliar and dangerous foes, moving into the wall corner. She violently slams her pair of injured wings first into the hard wall and feels fear, fright, and fury, slowly dropping down to the floor on her naked kneecaps and then wills an invisibility charm on her injured body and scared mind. A demon does not possess that supernatural ability. She shivers in fear and fright while staring at the line of dangerous foes.

The old man with the short white hair resembles a fake Santa Clause that visits all the earthling children and gives out fun presents during the Christmas holidays. He does not wear a round belly of fat but a jaw line of matching white whiskers on a pale face with a pair of rosy cheeks matching his rosy lips and stands in the middle of the line like the leader of the foes.

Inside the wall corner while grunting in pain and growling in fear, Priam views the three tall winged males from the sandy beach in Florida, recognizing their different hair color.

The same male from the beach possesses shoulder length, naturally wavy black colored hair stands and stands at six feet and six inches in height with a set of ripped muscles nicely bulging along his chest cavity, both of his arms and his two legs which are nicely outlined from his set of tight clothes. The white colored uniform, a long sleeved tee shirt underneath a sleeveless vest and paired with a set of leather pants, and his infamous scuffed and non-polished cowboy boots.

Inside the wall corner, Priam vividly recalls last night the white glowing tip coming from his magic powers that had resided on his single cowboy boot from her first encounter underneath the Florida scrub brush.

His pair of wings is inflated fully and expands into 22 feet in both height and width, exhibiting gold and electric blue colored alternating features which are outlined in a shiny golden hue. The male continues to stand in the line beside the old man and displays a pair of dancing teal-blue eyeballs on his rose-beige skin tone and black tinted whiskers on his jaw line. Then he violently coughs and then loudly sneezes recovering with a manly gag, wiping the clear mucus with one of his hand. He drops down that dirty hand and cleans the digits on his leather pants, continuing to sniff out loud, smiling at Priam.

Beside the black-haired male, a red ponytail hangs long from his rear skull and is attached on a face of pink skin with a pair of violet colored eyes and a pair of pink tinted lips. The skull sits on top of a body frame at six feet and seven inches in height with a pair of fully expanded 24 feet in bright orange hue. Inside the wall corner, Priam softly snorts with her evil thoughts. No kid or adult teases the tall male about his strawberry colored red hair or pink tinted lips.

His interior feathers rest on a white background holding an array of geometric shapes of horseshoes. A horseshoe is usually worn by a mammal that walks on its four hoofs on the earth soil and mostly lives in the open grassy ranches and country farms.

His horseshoe symbols display in different colors and sizes and is embedding onto each long feathers. Some horseshoes pose upside, upright, downside, and sideways over the wings lying to the left towards the right. The color range consists of solid hues in rich black, blood red, dark blue, dark green and deep purple on each wing. The outline of the wings is colored in deep purple. He wears the same white uniform, a long long-sleeved tee shirt, a sleeveless vest, a pair of tight leather pants, and a pair of rough and non-polished cowboy boots, loudly sneezing out loud and wipes the runny clear snot with the back of his hand. He clears a throat of thick mucus and continues to smile at Priam.

The last male wears a bald head without any hair strands and exhibits the same white attire. His body displays a tone of yellow-beige tinted skin, a pair of intense light green eyeballs, and a light brown goatee standing at six feet and five inches in height with a pair of 21 feet in expanded wings. Each wing is imprinted with numerous individually symbols of arrowheads in the colors of chocolate brown, dark brown, and light beige which are intermingled inside layers of light green, bright yellow, and fire engine red feathers. The wings are outlined in a dull orange tint. His hand holds another hand with the petite female beside him and as he leans down and whispers into her eardrum, turning to sneeze out loud, wiping his face with the other hand. He returns back and sniffs while smiling at Priam.

The petite female measures at five feet and four inches in height and wears a pair of 18 feet of rainbow coated wings in the colors of light green, pink, pale yellow, and soft lavender hue. Her set of expanded wings are outlined in a delicate rose tint going around the edge. The interior rows of fluffy feathers are coated in a pattern of duck symbols in the colors aqua and peach tint. She possesses a head of long waist-length blonde colored hair, a pair of dark green eyeballs, and a tone of light beige tinted skin, wearing a dress similar to little winged child, a tea-length white tinted sleeveless dress with a pair of matching flat ballerina slippers with a bowtie around each bone ankle. She smiles at Priam and holds the male's hand, lightly coughing then softly sneezes, wiping off the runny snot with her lady handkerchief also.

The row of foes continues to stand in line without movement but nosily coughs out loud while smiling at Priam.

Inside the row of dangerous foes, in the middle position, the older white haired male nods with a smile and extends both arms towards Priam. "Welcome home, Primus!" He coughs and the sneezes with runny snot from one nose hole whipping out the white colored wet handkerchief, wiping his face. He stores the wet handkerchief back into the vest pocket and then smiles at Priam.

"My name is Priam." Prima screams out loud with her nasty demon tone without shaking any body part that will cause great pain and maybe a state of body unconsciousness, still crouching in the wall corner for protection. Her pair of injured wings violently bang again against hard wall and as she cringes in fearful worry.

In the middle of the line, the white haired, older male gingerly stomps ahead with a smile, "Your name is Primus. I had named you, child. I am...."

He stops and lightly coughs then sneezes, pulling out a hidden handkerchief from his vest pocket, wiping his nostrils and mouth from the runny clear mucus, returning the dirty item back down into the pocket vest. He smiles at her and tries to advance ahead.

"Wait, Caiden!" An alto sounding voice coming from an unfamiliar female speaks out loud and as she reaches out and grabs the naked arm on Caiden, frowning at Priam and sneezes out loud. She wipes her runny nose with wet handkerchief and sneers at Priam behind the soft cloth.

"No. No! No! No, Jazmine!" Caiden shakes his white colored curly skull and smiles at Priam, yelling in frustration at the elderly female. "I have waited too long here for this special moment. Let go of me! Let me go!" He sneezes out loud and then coughs, whipping out the wet handkerchief again, drying his wet face. He drops his hands and stores the wet cloth, smiling at Priam.

"She's hurt. Can you not see her two wings, Caiden?" Jazmine nods to Priam and continues to grip his arm, coughing out loud and then sneezes wiping her face with a magical handkerchief near her cheekbone. She frowns at Priam.

Caiden continues to stare and studies Priam, slapping his chest with a smile. "I am your father," he coughs and then sneezes again, wiping his wet face with the dirty handkerchief, grinning at Priam.

"No!" Priam screams out loud and shakes in fear, warning the line of new foes with her death kill as a deadly demon. "No! No! No one knows of their parents inside the Demon Den. That's the way it is since the beginning of time."

He coughs out and then sneezes, wiping his wet face, saying with a smile. "That statement is so true. We leave with an assignment without returning back home, cupcake."

She leans forward and sneers at the older man. "I wanna leave here and go back to my home. Release me, right now!"

He waves his arms around the room with a smile. "This is your home, Primus. You are an angel," he coughs out loud and then sneezes, wiping off his wet face with the dirty handkerchief, smiling at Priam.

"I am a demon," she sneers and then smiles, tucking her body into the wall corner, banging her injured wings again into the wood with pain.

He shakes his skull and coughs out loud, saying with a smile. "Who told you that data, cupcake?"

She looks down with a stern face and stares at the polished wooden floor. Preston and rest of her demon mates had told her over and over again throughout the centuries that she was demon. Looking up at Caiden, she growls out loud. "Everyone told me the truth."

He coughs out loud with a nod. "Well, now, everyone is a lot of folks and sometimes they get confused. You are an angel, Primus."

"Where am I?" She turns and scans the large room with puzzlement.

"You are located here at your home, which we call, Angel Haven," he lightly coughs and then sneezes out loud, removing the wet, used handkerchief from his vest pocket, cleaning his wet mouth and nose.

She has never heard or visited Angel Haven. All the angels exist with her and live in the US State of Florida at the Key West USA military base. Blaze had talked non-stop about the day when the angels and the demons would fight over something, over somewhere, over someone.
Priam doesn't understand the reason, cause, or purpose of the upcoming war between the angels and demons. When she had once asked Preston about that future event, he had reassured her person that the angels and demons would never fight in a war. Then he had soothed her worries and her soft hair, leaning down with a tender kiss, as usual.

Right now, inside the big room with the line of foes, Priam misses Preston and his lovingly protection.

The line of dangerous foes continues to stand without movement and smile at Priam, so she must stay calm, think clearly, and get ready for a surprise escape from her new foes. She can fly straight back to Preston within the US State of Florida and arrive back at Demon Den, right before Curfew.

"I wanna go back to my demon home, right now." Priam yells out loud with her drooling mouth spit.

Caiden drops down on one knee and presses both hands on top of his kneecap, nodding with a smile to Priam, "Primus, I can see that I have lots of explaining to do between you and me." He winks at his daughter. "But, first, there is your angel health. I can see your limp wing. I know from personal experience that you are in pain and maybe a little fearful. Let us help you, Primus! Then you and I can talk after you feel better." He points at the female next to his rib cage and continues to talk and smile at Priam. "This nice lady is named Jazmine. Her magic is old, but very good. She can heal your body and your pair of injured angel wings, Primus." He coughs out loud and then sneezes, wiping his wet face with the dirty handkerchief again, staring at Priam.

Inside the wall corner, Priam does not move or speak, exhaling in pain. Her pair of injured wing aches with streams of shooting pain at her neck, across both of her collar bones, going down to her waistline and then coming back up into her brain cells. Then the pain rides back down her spine into her feet. The nerve endings are very upset with the constant throbs of pain.

"No!" Priam refuses to their medical treatment and scoots backward into the narrow wall corner, slamming her wings again against the hard wooden wall, grunting with pain. No one is touching her body or her wings again as each one might possess a powerful and warm touch like the unknown black-haired male. She couldn't resist his touch the first time and will not be able to resist his touch for a second time either.

Inside the wall corner, Priam continues to kneel on top of the floor and stares at the line of dangerous foes, sobbing in fear, angry, and sadness, missing Preston. She uses her limited demon telepathy, trying to contact his mind with her rescue. Preston doesn't know her exact location here but he is searching during the heated and long daylight hours for her, before he is required to stop the search and obey Curfew. Tears roll down her dirty, scared face.

In the row of dangerous foes, in the middle pose, Caiden exhales and then smiles. "I know you are suspicious of us, cupcake. I would be, also." He coughs out loud and continues to finger the old woman beside his rib cage, nodding with a smile. "Jazmine, can you heal Primus from this short distance? I don't think we can get any closer to her without a rebellion."

"The short distance isn't a problem, here, Caiden. My old magic can work anywhere. So, everyone, move away and stand back from me giving my body a little more breathing room, so I can work freely work my earth herbs." Jazmine waves a free hand at the line of foe and then drops down her hand, moving ahead, squatting down. She coughs out loud and fiddles with the bag, wearing a stern face.

Caiden and the other angels back step from Jazmine in silence and stops a few feet in front of the entrance wall while watching the old female work, occasionally performing a cough and then a sneeze from the nostrils and mouth and pats a wet face dry.

In the middle of the room, on top of the floor, Jazmine pulls a single crooked twig from one of the numerous trees on the mountain out from her medical bag, coughing out loud. She rubs a fine red tinted dust of powder one-fourth of the distance on top of the twig stick as the red powder disintegrates on the bark and then burns the red particles down into the wood, without touching the polished floor. She works and coats the ting twig completely with the red dust while sneezing out loud, wiping her nostrils with the magical handkerchief near her cheekbone.

Inside the wall corner, Priam leans ahead and stares with curiosity at the twig. Jazmine finishes the dusting and lifts up, aiming the crooked twig branch, coughing out loud to Priam. Priam jerks backward and slams her injured wings back into hard wood, grunting in pain, willing her person into invisibility which does not work. She sobs with a soft whisper, "Preston."

Jazmine does not fire the twig but stares with a stern face at Priam. "I am not going to harm you, Primus. I promise. I realize you and your fear are directed at me. This is my angel talent. This is an arrowroot powder used for pain, swelling, bruises, cuts, and infection. Based on my acute observation, you have ruptured your hypodermis. As you know, the medical aliment causes extreme pain and an infection, if the wound is open and bleeds between the wing muscle and skin which could cause more deadly consequences for an angel like you or me. This tiny dose of the powered arrowroot mineral will heal you instantly. Do not be afraid of me or us? Even at this short distance, I will be able to heal your beaten body and your injured wings, whether your mind or heart or soul wants my medical treatment or not." She coughs out loud and clears her dry throat, staring at Priam. The tiny wooden tree twig musically hums then beautifully explodes out a blue light from the tip, targeting the drooling arch on Priam's injured wing.

Inside the wall corner, Priam continues to kneel and sees the ray of blue light as it hit her injured wing. She feels great warmth and hears a soft hum inside each one of her eardrums as the ray smells like a patch of ripen strawberries over the fertile ground. She giggles with silliness and closes her eyelashes as a ray of continuous heat and warmth penetrates her injured wing. The warmth and heat slowly travel down the healed arch through each one of her damaged feathers, moving down in smooth heat, flowing inward towards her arching back muscles and all the torn tissues in warmth like the sun and gentleness like a mother's kiss.

Priam slowly slumps down and then lands on the floor, sitting on her fanny with a silly grin as the blue tinted ray of heated warmth invades the other wing, riding down her back spine and finger massages an array of gentle strokes throughout her aching body. She feels her demon strength return and the numerous repairs on her damaged muscle tissue while quickly healing and then possessing a pair of healthy wings for her vicious demon fight for freedom and then survival with the line of dangerous foes.

An alto voice bombards the quiet room and then coughs out loud, clearing a dry throat, "I know you didn't trust us, Primus. So I would like to point out that my medical treatment has relieved the pain and completely healed your wound. Did that hurt your body or your wings?" Jazmine slowly sits down on top of the hard floor and sneezes out loud, wiping her wet face with the wet magical handkerchief at her cheekbone while staring at Priam.

Inside the wall corner, Priam continues to sit and opens her eyelashes, staring at Jazmine. Jazmine sits in a cross-legged position on top of the floor and continues to hold the red coated tree twig in the air in front of her nose bridge while coughing out loud. She wiggles side to side and then sneezes out loud, wiping off her wet face with the magical, floating, but dirty wet lady handkerchief near her jaw line.

Inside the wall corner, with a completely healed demon body, Priam swiftly stands upright from the floor and leans against the wall while readying a fight for freedom with the line of supernatural foes. She glances toward the window and sees the mountain side, where she can hide from her planned escape. Once safely airborne in the sky, she can find the State of Florida near the Gulf of Mexico without any man-made instrument compass, returning back home to Preston and her Demon Den.

"No!" Priam whispers with her gratitude of magical medical treatment for a fast healing as she doesn't know any of these supernatural beings and doesn't want to know any of these supernatural beings, desiring to leave and return back home to Preston. She continues to study each one of her foes.

On top of the floor in a cross-legged pose, Jazmine coughs out loud and then smirks at Priam. "Do you feel a little better, angel?"

"Yes!" Priam answers properly as she has been taught as a little demon to honor all of her elder demons.

Caiden slowly moves ahead and dances side to side with a happy smile to Priam. "Good. Good. Good. May I continue here, Jazmine?" He coughs out loud and smiles at Priam.

"No!" Priam answers out of turn with a demon sneer at the old man and continues to stand inside the wall corner. Caiden stops with a gasp of shock and frowns with worry, sitting down on the floor in silence, sneezing out loud. He wipes his face with the dirty cloth and stares at Priam.

Near the entrance wall beside his friends, the unknown black-haired male slowly advances ahead and then stops, coughing out loud with a loud sneeze, wiping off his nose with the back of his hand. He starts to walk ahead again and nods with a smile. "Prims, the re-acquaint-ness of your person into the community is going to take some time. Please, give me, all of us a chance. That's all we ask at the moment."

"I wanna leave from here, right now." Priam sneers with her nasty demon tone and stares at the black-haired male.

The tall black-haired male stops on top of the floor and sneezes out loud, wiping off his face, squatting down and sits beside Caiden, who sits beside Jazmine. The other three angels slowly advance ahead and stop, coughing out loud with a loud sneeze, wiping off the runny snot. Each one squats down and sits in a cross-legged pose on top of the floor, forming a new row of dangerous foes.

On the floor, in a cross-legged pose, the black-haired male slaps his chest and then coughs out loud, sneezing out snot balls, wiping off his mouth with a naked hand. He grins to Priam. "I am Teague. Do you remember me?" He possesses a head of shoulder length, naturally wavy black hair, a pair of teal-blue eyes on a rose-beige face with a jaw line of black tinted whiskers, extending a hand in friendly, violently coughing out loud and then loudly sneezes. His hand wipes backward cleaning off the rolling snot from his lips and nostrils, wiping the dirty hand down on his trousers and as he smiles back at Priam.

"No!" Priam growls at the male and continues to stand inside the wall corner.

He reaches out and slaps the muscular bicep on the male with the red colored ponytail, coughing out loud and then sneezes, wiping off the snot ball with his naked hand. He nods with a smile to Priam. "This is our friend, who is named Scooter. Scooter sits beside our two other friends, Veck and his girl Bandy. Do you remember any of us, Prims?" He sneezes again.

"No!" Priam shakes sideways her brown skull and sneers at him.

Each one of the angels continues to sit on top of the floor with a smile and without movement, first coughing out loud and then sneezes, wiping off a set of runny clear mucus from each nose hole while pondering Priam and her strange behavior. Priam doesn't seem to realize their smiling face or their purpose here on Planet Earth.

Inside the wall corner, Priam continues to stand against the hard wood without pain but healthy angry. She does not wonder about the row of foes, only plotting her freedom from the enclosed room, without killing one of the supernatural talented foes. She has never harmed another man, mammal, or insect, but there is always the first time.

On top of the floor, Teague continues to sit and then coughs out loud, sneezing out a series of clear looking snot balls from each nose hole, displaying an aura of curled silver hue which is highlighted in a single row of pink, yellow, and green.

Pink represents love. Yellow means friendship. Green expresses good health.

His colorfully gold and blue angel wings are now deflated and stored back down into his back spine in a pair of tiny pinky fingers and as he sneezes and then wipe off the mouth drool with the back of his naked hand, cleaning the limb on the floor. "I had called you, Prims, when you were a small little girl which is shortened for your given name, Primus. Does that name sound familiar to you, Prims?"

"No!" She sneers and as her eyeballs shift into an empty hallway without seeing movement. So, the row of dangerous foes has not brought a group of armed guards. Else, the armed guards might be hiding beyond the exit door waiting further down in the dark corridor.

No matter!

Priam feels strong, fierce, and quietly mad after being taken away from her Demon Den home and her boyfriend Preston. He is searching for Priam while soaring high in the skies watching and waiting for her rescue signal coming from the secret location. If she can get outside this room, then Priam can use her clever bird call from her fatherly figure Morton. He had taught her that trick when in trouble.

Teague continues to smile between the coughing fits, talking with a set of useless sentences to Priam. "Caiden, he sits beside me and he is your true biological father. You were born here on top of the mountain summit sixteen years ago. We are all your friends. This is Scooter, Veck, and Bandy. Do you remember any of us, Prims?"

"No!" Priam snarls at Teague and leans against the wall with confidence as her wings bend and conform into the hard surface, without any suffering pain, only a dose of healthy strength. She looks up and smiles at the high beams on the ceiling rafters that measure twenty feet from the floor.

She understands the layout within the wide and high room which has been designed for a pair of flying wings, maybe where the little kids, like the small winged girl, who had spied on Priam, practices their flying lessons without harming their bone skull or wingtips. Her enemy's mistake is her personal freedom within five more seconds.

On top of the floor, the row of dangerous foes continues to sit and smile while occasionally coughing and then sneezes, staring at Priam.

"Prims, maybe, if we leave this room, then we can go on a tour in the village here on top of the mountain summit. Then, maybe, some of the old sights and sounds would trigger your old memory. How does that sound? We can do that right now," Teague nods and then coughs out loud, clearing a dry throat.

Inside the wall corner, Priam slowly bends down and barely touches her fanny down to the floor planks, holding her breath, leaping from the floor and explodes out her 18 feet demon wings. She swishes once for more height and more strength flying up towards the ceiling rafters and misses the log beam with an evil laugh. She slowly encircles the vaulted ceiling planks running in between each wooden cross beams with her newly healed wings, laughing with fun.

On top of the floor, the row of dangerous foes swiftly stands from the floor but does not take flight about Priam.

On top of the ceiling rafters, Priam touches the top and then swings around, swiftly diving down into the middle of the room space, steering towards the open doorway and laughs out loud.

Inside the room, Teague quickly reacts feeling stunned, foolish, man and concern. If Primus gets outside the tower structure, then she will freely and swiftly fly into the open skyline, running back to Preston and her Demon Den in Florida. Teague has to stop Priam immediately and make her listen to his wise words and the words from the other angels as she is in imminent danger from Preston and the other demons.

Teague bends his kneecaps and leaps from the floor into the air, stretching up his hand, barely missing with her leg as she gracefully sails through open chamber door with her new talents. He lands back down the floor and spins around, dashing through the open archway with a smile at her new strength, racing through the hallway with his friends. He hushes down the staircase and leads his friends Scooter, Veck, Bandy, Caiden, and Jazmine.

Inside the hallway, Priam flies through the air and steers down the staircase of light wood, flying up towards the arched ceiling with a smile for her freedom. She swiftly circles the rafter that holds an enclosed glass dome which is one hundred from the floor inside a strange tall building with an interesting design. This building is a training facility for the younger children angels.

On the light colored wooden staircase, Caiden leaps from the step, flies through the air, and lands in front of Teague, spinning around with a stern tone, grabbing Teague. "No, Teague!" Teague sneers at the old man and looks up to see Priam in silence.

Caiden spins around from Teague with concern and stares at Priam. "You might cause her body to sustain more injury. Primus isn't familiar with layout of the Tower and is uncomfortable with you and us."

"She'll escape from here and glide away through the open skyline." Scooter stops and stands beside Teague, looking up at Priam.

"No!" Caiden closes his eyelids and uses his mighty angel powers, coughing out loud, clearing a dry throat.

Jazmine stops and stands beside Caiden, coughing out loud, staring at Priam. "Caiden is quick and wise. He is swiftly locking down all door latches and the glass panes with his angle thoughts. Primus can't operate the glass shutters with her limited angel abilities. Thus, she is trapped in here with us. Watch her as she is forced to land. Then..."

"Then, we start all over again," Veck slowly climbs down the step with his girl Brandy, coughs out loud, and stops behind the back spine on Teague and Scooter, watching Primus at the ceiling.

Bandy coughs out loud and looks up with a sneeze to see Priam, wiping off her wet face with the dirty handkerchief. "Yes, we will continue to befriend her. She doesn't seem to remember us. Why's that, Jazmine?"

Jazmine coughs out loud and then sneezes, wiping off her wet face with the floating dirty handkerchief, watching Priam and the glass dome on the ceiling.

Teague continues to cough out loud and stares at Priam. "She's only afraid. Once she understands, she'll be fine and dandy with us and here at her home."

Caiden coughs out loud and watches Primus flies around the dome top inside the room. "How long will that be, Jazmine?"

"I predict not long." Jazmine coughs out loud and moves off the staircase toward the huddle of kids on the opposite wall, on top of the pink tinted dirt floor, waving both of her hands with a smile. "Come along, gentlemen and ladies! We don't want to miss the rest of the flying show."

Caiden steps off the staircase with a smile and then coughs out loud, watching Priam, moving to the opposite wall with the huddle of children also.

Teague and Scooter follow behind Caiden. Veck holds Bandy's hand climb off the staircase and follow Teague and Scooter. Each one stares up at Priam near the glass dome.

On top of the ceiling with the glass dome, Priam is trapped. Each glass pane has been latched, shut, and sealed with magic from the elder man. She can't escape through the glass without shattering the window dome, which is a stupid option. Each pane measures four inches of thick glass. She isn't a powerful demon like Preston and wishes for a heavy instrument to break the glass and then leap to her freedom. Else, she will receive numerous bloody cuts and wounds on her healed demon body and become helpless and unable to defend her person against her new foes and then re-captured with ease.

Priam continues to fly below the glass dome and feels the heated rays of the sun, looking down, surveying each level on a five story building. She can't bust through the thick glass on the dome, but she can walk out the entrance front door like a human.

Priam rolls her shoulders and stores her pair of expanded wings into a set of pinky wings, falling down through the air in dive mode, aiming towards the unguarded entrance. This tall and slender building is a training facility with wide doorway allowing each new angel to enter and then leave with wing or foot freedom. She only needs one feet of width distance between her folded wings and two permanently wooden archways while easily exiting the building.

In the far wall corner, the female child angel practices her takeoff from the floor and floats in the air which is the required thirteen inches from the dirt floor and then performs a hard landing back down on top of the packed dirt as her teacher teaches. She is a good angel and strong for her age of six celestial years old.

She looks up with a smile and views the bigger angel with a pair of pink tinted fluffy feathers, who flies around the glass dome inside the Tower at rapid speed, which is not allowed. So, the bigger angel is participating in another wing exhibition show here inside the training facility, which is allowed, sometimes.

"Goody!" The small child angel wants to become part of the new flying show and flaps her pair of tiny white colored wings, lifting off the dirt floor in the air, flying towards the bigger angel. "Funner!" She calls out and smiles to the bigger angel, waving her arms in the air for the new flying show, "Hey, angel! See me!"

In the middle of the air, Priam veers from the huddle of angels and targets the open archway, seeing beams of dancing sunlight on top of the floor and then outside in the dirt soil. The huddle of angels continues to stand on the floor, without flight, and watch Priam. She is not concern as she is not going to harm anyone but escape from here and return back home to Florida with Preston.

A few feet from the wall corner in the rear of the large room, the child angel quickly reaches a scary plane of twenty feet in the air waves as her white and yellow colored, starfish-patterned pair of tiny angel wings start to ache with pain on her back spine and she grows tired of flying, yelling out to the bigger angel and waves both of her hands, "Hey, angel! See me!"

In the middle of the room, Priam swiftly glides over the hair roots on the child angle and hears the tiny voice of mumbling kiddie words in her eardrums, glancing back with curiosity.

In the air, the angle child reduces her wing speed at twenty feet. The drag or air resistance from Priam's bigger wing span hits the body on the angel child, stalling the little girl in flight. The child slowly twirls in a completely circle from the powerful wind gust losing her mental concentrate on her flight procedure and then stops flapping her tiny wings. She screams in fear.

Priam remembers learning to fly as a young demon. Leaving the dirt ground is a scary sensation and falling down back toward the dirt ground is a terrifying fear, especially for a small child.

In the air, several feet from the open archway for an easy escape, Priam watches the angel child swiftly drop down like a rock based on Earth's gravity, which is faster than angel speed.

The group of angel training instructors stands on top of the dirt floor inside the opposite wall corner and protects the other children, staring up at Priam. No other person can fly and then intercept the child in time, before the kid smashes her fragile body down into the hard wooden floor in pain or death.

Priam twists her body with an upside ugly pose and then beautifully performs an awesome back flip toward the direction of falling angel child.

She is trying to save the kid, before the child violently dies from her painful internal bleeding of each vital organ after slamming down into a non-moving object, the hard floor.

The biological nervous, respiratory, muscular, and vascular system for an angel uses the same body parts which are similar to a human. So, the angel child will die from shock and severe body damage. Then her mother and father will become very upset and sad.

In the air, Priam sharply angles and then dives down at a twirling child. The child wildly rolls side to side without traction from her wings, falling straight down toward the hard packed dirt floor from fifteen feet. Priam forms her body into a straight line tapping more torque and speeds downward as the angel child drops eight feet from floor.

Priam ducks her skull down into her neck muscles for protection and stares down at the upcoming hard floor which is six feet from her face, reaching out with both arms, scooping up the twirling child and cradles the young girl into her chest. Her flying body veers upward and sails back up towards the ceiling, exploding out her beautifully demon wings in mid-flight, swiftly rushing up toward the dome and then slows the brakes on her demon speed.

An angel can't stop on a dime in the air and neither can Priam.

Priam halts right below the ceiling glass dome and hovers one foot from the thick glass, bathing in the bright heated sunlight coming through the clear glass. She continues to hug the child into her chest and gently pats the soft blonde colored hair roots on the girl. The young girl sobs with tears and then lightly coughs, sneezing out loud into the dirty pink colored tee shirt on Priam.

Priam continues to hover near the glass down with concern. "Are you okay, lambie pie? We're going to float down together landing down on the floor. Is that okay with you?"

"Okay," the child meekly states and hides her face into Priam's chest, lightly coughing out loud and then sneezes out loud, wiping her runny nose on Priam's dirty tee shirt

Priam giggles at the childish reaction and slowly drops down, swishing one expanded wing to control her speed and descend back down towards the hard floor. "I promise. There will be no more scary rides for the day, lambie pie," she smiles.

"Okay," the child meekly states and hides her face into Priam's chest, lightly coughing out loud and then sneezes out loud, wiping her wet eyeballs and a runny nose with on Priam's dirty pink tee shirt, clinging onto her waistline.

Priam softly lands in the middle of the hard floor with the angel child on her chest inside a loose circle of angels, consisting of Caiden, Jazmine, Teague, Scooter, Bandy, and Veck. Priam whispers to the little girl and then slowly drops the child down onto the floor.

The little girl spins around from Priam and stares at the circle of big angels. In the circle, Bandy squats down with a smile and motions for the little girl. The child runs to the open arm on Bandy and sobs into Bandy's chest, feeling fear and fright, coughing out loud and then sneezes with a runny nose of snot. She wipes the snot on Bandy's arm.

"Yeah," Priam stands in place and softly moans with worry, staying at her circle of new un-friends, standing helpless, trapped, and surrounded by a group of healthy and strong older angels readying for the fight.

In front of Priam, Caiden coughs out loud and then sneezes out loud, wiping his wet face with the dirty handkerchief, staring at Priam. He deflates his wings as a signal to deflate the tense situation without a battle, guarding the entrance archway inside the tall building.

On the opposite wall corner, the other angel instructors swiftly depart the lobby room with the huddle of children. Each angel displays an inflated pair of wings which is etched with colorful geometric shapes.

That's a good plan clearing the room of innocent ones, Priam doesn't desire the "little" kids hurt, but the "big" kids harmed are a different demon matter, since a demon likes to do a set of wicked things on everyone, everything and every chance.

Caiden steps forward towards Priam with a smile and then stops, coughing out loud and sneezes, wiping off his wet face with the dirty handkerchief.

"Don't touch me!" Priam screams out loud and continues to stand in the middle of the circle, slowly twirling around, holding both of her palms near her sneer while readying for a deadly strike against Caiden.

"Primus, please, try to understand the situation here with us." Caiden coughs out loud and wipes his mouth with the wet handkerchief, smiling at her back spine.

"I understand one thing: fight." Priam continues to swirl around and sneers at each foe, punching both of her fists in air wave with demon drama.

"I..." Teague loudly coughs and then violently sneezes, wiping off his wet face with both hands, expanding the arms and wet hands to Priam. "We are not going to harm you, Prims," he shuffles side to side with nervousness in anticipation, fear, and curiosity as he heavily coughs then sneezes, wiping his mouth with back of his hand, extending the arm back to her face.

She slowly swirls around and sneers at Scooter and then Veck as each dangerous foe lightly coughs and then sneezes, recovering manly by wiping a wet nose with the back of a hand, smiling at Priam. She continues to search for an escape route from the dangerous foes.

In the circle, Teague stares with worry at Priam. The building cannot be permanently closed off with large boulders or nailed wooden planks, unless a ferocious sky battle was occurring over the pale blue skyline near the mountain summit that would threatens the angel younglings. So, Priam must stay here inside the building.

Teague reacts with nervous and worried energy, continuing to study her. If Priam leaps through the open door, then he will leap and pounce after her flying body. Teague doesn't want to perform that frightful maneuver, because Priam is prepared to fight and flee, going back to Preston and the Demon Den.

"Attack! Go ahead! Come and attack me, if you dare!" Priam continues to swirl and sneers at each foe while daring one or all of the four younger foes, who are taller and stronger than she. While she plans to attack the elder couple of man and wife with ease and use them as a set of hostages to negotiate her freedom outta of this strange place.

"We're not going to attack you, Primus. Please, listen to Caiden. He speaks the truth." Scooter continues to stand in the circle and coughs out loud, sneezing once, by wiping his fingers on his flaming nostrils of running snot, flinging the mucus down to the floor.

"Here, we go, once, again." Veck laughs and then coughs out loud, covering his mouth, sneezing into his palm, flinging his wet mucus down on the floor with a distorted face.

Bandy coughs out loud and then sneezes, wiping her face with the wet handkerchief, cuddling the young angel child, entertaining the child, "Stop it, Veck!"

"No one of us are going harm you, Primus." Jazmine continues to stand in the circle and coughs out loud, clearing her dry throat, staring at the back spine on Priam. "Do you remember a few minutes ago? I willingly and freely and lovingly healed your injured wing with my magic," she lightly coughs and then sneezes, wiping her nose and mouth with a dry cloth.

Caiden stands beside Bandy and squats down, leaning over, whispering with a smile into the face of the child. The pale-skinned, blonde-haired child nods with a giggle and wipes her tears of fears. He nods back and then coughs out loud, sneezing once, covering his face. He slowly stands upright from the floor and stares at the back spine on Priam.

The angel child smiles with both hands over her giggles and spins away from Bandy and Caiden wearing a white colored short, sleeveless dress, a pair of flat slippers, and a set of inflated tiny wings with scattered tiny symbols of solid yellow starfish over her white rows of feathers.

Caiden laughs and then coughs out loud, "We...we are not going to touch you, Primus."

Inside the circle, Priam continues to slowly twirl and faces each one of her foes, posing in a fighting stance for her offensive attack with her expanded wings. "I don't believe you, any of you. I wanna go back home right now. I wanna leave here now." She has never fought a fight, so six to one odds are a pretty terribly set of math numbers for a novice demon while calling out telepathically for her boyfriend Preston to arrive and protect her right now. She views Teague. He continues to stand and shakes his bone skull with a stern face signaling silently to Priam that she isn't leaving here through the guarded archway.

On the floor, the angel child slowly moves ahead towards Priam and holds the edges of her dress hem with her finger pads, stopping two feet from the bigger girl, giggling with a grin.

Inside the circle, Priam swirls around with a gasp and halts in front of the child, looking down at the little girl that she had saved from death. She looks up to see Caiden and then back down to see the girl, feeling both confusion and curiosity. Now, the angel child has become a new weapon against Priam as Priam will defensively defend her body and her soul with a bloody fight, even with an innocent small child. She watches the child for any violent, swift movement with great concern and care.

"Curtsey." Caiden smiles at Priam and then coughs out loud, clearing a dry throat.

The angel child slowly shifts one of her flat slippers back behind her right leg, deeply bending down at her left kneecap while continuing to hold the edges on the dress hemline in the air, lifting the delicate fabric three inches from her exposed ankle bones. She tucks her chin down into her chest and then gracefully curtseys down towards Priam, giggling with a grin to the floor.

Priam continues to stand and stares down at the child, musically huffing and then puffs, exhaling with a deep sigh, inhaling fresh air molecules. The curtsey motion weirdly stirs a happy and loving ancient memory with a vivid image inside Priam's mind from a long, long time.

A little girl wears a short, white colored sleeveless dress down to her kneecaps, a pair of flat white colored slippers, and a pair of brown pig tails at the age of five years old.

She performs a graceful curtsey to a mature male, who possesses a head of light brown colored hair, a jaw line of light brown colored whiskers with less wrinkles on his pale face.

Inside the circle, in front of the curtseying child, Priam gasps in shock and looks up to see Caiden. He nods with a smile and then coughs out loud, clearing his throat. She returns back and stares down at little girl, who boldly holds her curtsey pose, and then looks back to see Caiden again.

In the circle, Caiden claps with a smile, "Thank you for your lovely curtsey, angel! Now, go outside and run along with playtime with your friends, honey." He coughs then sneezes, wiping his nose and mouth with the wet handkerchief.

Inside the circle, the angel child stands upright from the curtsey pose and giggles out loud to Priam, covering her mouth, spinning around on her tippy toes, dashing away from Priam toward the open archway and then stops. She swings around and frowns to Caiden, yelling out loud with a sour frown. "She smells," she waves her both of her hands with a friendly smile and spins around, skipping out the non-guarded archway, disappearing into the bright sunlight.

Inside the circle, Priam turns and stares at the child, then the beams of bright sunlight through the open archway, returning back to see Caiden. She looks down at the polished floor and looks up to see Teague. He nods with a smile and then coughs out loud, clearing his throat.

Priam turns and stares at Caiden, blinking her eyelashes with her old memory, sobbing with tears and finally whispers, where each pair of eardrums picks up. "I am your daughter."

Caiden nods several times and smiles. "Yes." He coughs out loud and clears a dry throat.

"I am Primus."

"Yes." He sneezes out loud and wipes off the wet face with a dirty handkerchief.

"I am an angel."

He coughs out loud with a smile, "Yes."

"Do you remember me, now, Prims?" Teague smiles at her and then coughs out loud, clearing a dry throat, pointing towards his friends Scooter, Veck, and Bandy as each one coughs out loud and then sneezes once, wiping off a wet face, smiling at Priam/Primus.

"I was five years old." Priam/Primus nods with a smile.

"You were five years old." Caiden nods with a cough and then clears his throat.

Priam/Primus points at the open archway. "I looked like her. I was like her. I remembered being like her. I was taught to curtsey like her in that manner."

Jazmine coughs out loud and clears her dry throat. "This is a movement of honor and respect to your elders."

Priam/Primus stares at Caiden, whispering. "I curtseyed to you."

Caiden nods and then coughs out loud, clearing his throat. "We teach all younglings to curtsey and bow to their parents."

"My parents!" She gasps.

"I am your father." Caiden slaps his chest and coughs out loud.

"I am Primus, not Priam." She tilts her jaw line and as her set of smart neurons exposes the truth. "I am your, cupcake." She sobs with tears of joy and happiness as each droplet rolls down her dirty face, recalling vividly her pet name from her loving parents.

Caiden sneezes once and wipes his nose with the wet handkerchief, smiling at her. "I called your cupcake, because you like to eat sweets, so much, especially, the vanilla cake with white icing." Tear floods his two eyeballs and as he sneezes once, wiping his nose with the wet cloth, staring at his lovely daughter in flesh and blood.

"I still do, Father," she smiles. "You really are my father. I recalled with clarify and love." Primus feels stunned, shocked, surprised, happy, sad, and everything vertically rippling up and down her nervous system, bombarding her mind, heart, and body as she visually shivers and shakes with excitement and eagerness.

Caiden quickly approaches in two long strides and hugs her shivering body, kissing her wet cheekbone, pulling back with a smile. "There, there child, you are here and safe now," he coughs out loud and sneezes several times, wiping off his wet nose and mouth with the dirty, wet cloth. "No one's going to harm you here ever." He violently coughs and then sneezes several times, wiping his mouth with cloth.

"Father!" She gasps in alarm at his cold and back steps from his hug, feeling strange emotions of safe, comfortable, and secure with him. She has finally found her father after all these centuries and desires for her boyfriend Preston to be here with her and her father.

"Primus, I love you, child." Caiden leans over and hugs her body, coughing out loud, pulling back with a several times in a row, wiping off the wet face with the wet cloth.

She gasps in alarm with love for her new father and worry with his severe cold. "I am sorry, Father. I haven't bathed in a while. I must smell to high heavens," chuckling.

He nods and sneezes, wiping off his face with the cloth, smiling at her, "Smell or no smell! I have my cupcake with me now. You can freshen up later. Let's go and talk for the moment." He coughs out loud and then sneezes several times wiping the cloth over his wet nose and mouth.

"I love you, Father," Primus smiles. "I do not..."

"Everyone, come with me this way! We have to discuss and plan," Jazmine back steps from the circle with a sneeze and spins around, coughing out loud, clearing her throat, swiftly moving ahead. She leads all the other angels toward the open archway of the training building.

Scooter and Teague slowly turn with a smile and follow behind Jazmine, exiting the building, moving in the bright rays of sunshine within a late afternoon of cold weather on the mountain summit.

Veck and Bandy turn with a grin and follow behind Scooter and Teague, leaving the building, entering into the bright sunlight.

Inside the room, Caiden and Primus continue to cuddle and then turn to face the open archway, slowly exiting the building into the new landscape outside the training building.

The new landscape contains only pink tinted loose dirt that stretches for half-a-mile over the flat summit. Around the summit, a semi-crooked single horizontal line of individual pieces of chopped off tree trunk outline the edge. in between the wooden railing, the natural land is scattered with pods of colorful native wildflowers, several small grove of two or three fir trees, numerous short and squat individual blue stoned abode houses for an individual angel family, and individual circles with dirt and curved stones which have been fashioned into a set of sitting chairs and long sofas like pieces of human furniture.

Jazmine leads the angels and halts, slowly encircling a pod of pink tinted dirt and one slender fir tree, selecting literally a dirty spot in front of the fir tree.

A fir tree grows slender and up towards the sunlight like a straight sewing needle with numerous brown tinted branches of rich dark green prickly leaves that can blood the flesh. The single fir tree does not offer much protection from the blinding sunlight.

She motions with a hand to the other angels with a tern face. "Everyone, come over here and sit on top of the dirt without the nasty bugs. Scooter has consumed all of them already." She coughs out loud and sits in a cross-legged pose on top of the dirt with her inflated 19 feet wings in full span readying for a pretend battle.

Teague, Scooter, Veck, and Bandy arrive and select a dirty spot flopping down and pose in a cross-legged position, forming a loose circle around the pod of colored wild flowers.

From the archway on the Tower Building, over a long pathway of embedded blue tinted rock stones, after three fits of coughing and sneezing from Caiden, Primus and her father finally join the gathering of angels on top of the dirt. Birds sing. Flowers bloom. Little blades of sand grass sway side to side in light mountain breeze. Caiden sits first and coughs out loud numerous times and then sneezes several times, wiping off his wet mouth and nose with the dirty handkerchief.

Primus sits with a grin beside her true biological father. Teague tries to shuffle closer to Primus and then bounces into the steady, fluffy edge on her inflated wings, leaning over and smiles into her cheekbone. He is not able to hold her hand either as his pair of expanded 22 feet angel wings crowd the air waves on each side of his body while readying for a pretend battle also.

On top of the grass, Primus quietly sits and exposes her inflated wings, where her wing edge barely touches the wing tip on her father. He readies for a pretend battle also.

Each angel sits on top of the grass with a pair of expanded wings pretty close without squeezing another inch closer and bumping into a set of colored sensitive feathers. She turns with a smile and scans the group with confusion, concern, and curiosity at all the pretty colors on each pair of expanded angel wings. Maybe, her father wants her to see the pretty designs as each pair of demon wings are only colored in tones of dull red to blood red, like Preston's wings.

"Preston!" She whispers for her eardrums with worry and concern for his person, deeply missing his laugh and his hug as she has been with Preston for many centuries, since a little girl. Then she gasps in alarm with her wild thoughts regarding the absent of her biological father from her life.

In the bright sunshine, in the cold temperatures, at the mountain summit, on top of the grass underneath the shade tree, Jazmine inhales deep breathes and then exhales with a whisper. "Exhale first and then inhale deeply. Everyone! Exhale first and then inhale deeply. Exhale first and then inhale deeply." Each angle obeys in silence. She softly coughs out loud with a nod. "That should do the trick," she clears her throat and whispers with a smile. "An angel possesses a set of enhanced hearing, sight and smell."

"Taste, you forget to say, taste." Scooter laughs and then coughs out loud, clearing his dry throat.

"Forget, Scooter! He eats anything and everything if not claimed by man, beast or demon. He doesn't have any taste buds only tongue tonsils to lick the platter clean." Veck chuckles and then coughs out loud, clearing a dry throat.

"Nay! Nay!" Scooter laughs out loud without coughing or sneezing.

Primus laughs as she slowly learns about her new angel friends, her new home place, and her new father. She thinks of Preston, desiring to visit here and run back to Florida telling him about her father. Then Preston could live the Demon Den and live her with her new family as Preston does not have a mother, father, sister, brother, cousin, aunt or uncle.

Jazmine clears her throat and sneers at Primus. Well, Primus has newly learned that an angel can use and abuse their telepathy power like demon girl Colee also. Primus stares back with a stern face at Jazmine, who possesses a set of ancient skin and numerous deep wrinkles from the bright sunshine here on top of the summit, when her ugly face is compared to her father's.

Primus swiftly shuts up her brain cells and set up an angel shield around her mental thoughts.

Jazmine turns and yells out loud at Scooter, "Hush, Scooter!" She fakes a smile with a soft whisper to each face, "Therefore, an angel does not need to shout or raise a voice..."

"... only a hand..." Veck jerks both of his arms in the air and wiggles his finger for fun, laughing with his friends.

Jazmine nods, "Hmm! That is an excellent display of more teen disobedience. Hush, Veck! We know all the players. Now, let us s discuss the play."

"What play?" Veck frowns.

"This is a reference to something great or lousy, hoss." Scooter laughs and punches Veck.

Jazmine nods. "Primus, you are an angel who was born here on this mountain peak, which is called Angel Haven..."

"She knows that," Caiden nods with a smile. "Get to the good stuff, Jazmine."

Jazmine shakes her curls and frowns. "Primus, she doesn't remember that, do you, dear?"

"No." Primus turns and frowns at her father, only seeing part of his face between his massive wings.

Jazmine whispers softly. "There is a very good explanation for Primus's memory loss. I will explain that concept a little later in our conversation. For now, your father is Caiden..."

"Where is my biological mother?" Primus smiles and scans the circle without her mother present.

He exhales. "She was lost..."

"...during the battle..." Jazmine nods. "Primus, please, allow me to tell the entire story!"

"All right." Primus turns and nods with a sad face to Jazmine. Caiden nods at his daughter from the vast sitting distance, since his battle wings occupy her and his touching space.

Jazmine nods. "You were taken from us..."

"Taken!" Primus gasps in alarm.

"You were kidnapped, captured, stolen by Preston," Teague sneers at Jazmine.

"Preston!" Primus gasps in shock and feels fierce indignant and doubt about this gang of angels. She has lived with Preston for centuries, since she was very young. He has been kind and loving to her every minute, every hour, every day, except, at night, when Curfew separates them.

She sneers at each face. "I do not believe you. You are mistaken. Preston has been..."

"Been what, Prims?" Teague gasps with worry about Preston and the other demons with Primus.

Caiden swiftly stands upright from the grass and motions down to Primus. She swiftly stands upright from the grass with a stern face and reaches out, grabbing his hand with caution.

Caiden coughs and then sneezes once, wiping his wet mouth with a dry cloth, nodding to her. "Please, come and walk with me." They slowly move off the circle of manicured green colored grass and slowly stroll over a grayish-blue tinted stoned walkway, advancing around planted pods of short and tall colorful wildflowers and groves with short and tall spruce trees and then stop, standing in front of a tree log that serves as a single wooden railing.

Each one of her new angel friends exits the manicured circle of dirt in front of lonely, tall spruce tree and follow Caiden, and then stop, posing one at a time at the same long chopped off log with brown tinted tree bark and roaming bugs, overlooking the mountain summit also.

Standing beside her father and Teague, Primus views the valley below and then turns to see the wandering new flock of angels. Numerous angels mosey ahead in pairs or trios and sit down, sharing one of the long wooden benches in front of the dangerous wooden railing that leads down a steep slope of pink and grayish-blue and white jagged rocks and small outcrops of wildflowers. Eventually a falling body will hit and then land down on top of the hard soil of pink hue, maybe injured or bleeding or dead.

The other angels slowly scoot around with angel assignments or angel work while spying on the new arrival with curiosity and intrigue, entering into one of the tall buildings.

Primus watches with a smile and happiness at her new home and her flock of angel friends, overhearing some of the precious words from each parted lips on every angel.

An angel possesses a set of enhanced hearing, sight, and other senses, unlike a demon which does not exhibit good hearing or excellent eye sight from living centuries inside an enclosed dark cave or dark dwelling during Curfew.

The mountain air is mostly dry with cold temperatures of 47 degrees and blinding beams bright and heated sunrays coming down from the pale blue sky. Each sunray continues to warm each fluffy feather and hard bone with heat on her newly healed body.

Primus returns back with a smile and views the valley canyon with her angel eyeballs, seeing two dark green flowing fresh water rivers and a few fresh water lakes, rolling yellow and pink tinted mountain hills, scattered tiny yellow and red painted towns, a few pink colored dirt roads, a series of loud moving human vehicles, a paved gray colored highways and each stinky human. She gasps in shock and covers her nose, gagging out loud, clearing her sinus. She continues to scan the mountain range, where each summit is colored in snow caps or groves of spruce-fir trees or hard rocks in blue, pink, and yellow that beautifully intersects a clear pale blue sky.

Her angel vision can see and scan for miles into each one of the scattered towns surrounded by a painted scene of flat, pink tinted desert with scattered pods of colorful native vegetation grass and wildflowers, straight rows of pointy dark green spruce and fir trees. Each tree appears slender like it has been on a weight diet and points straight up directly into heaven.

She giggles with the image within her mental mind. "A perfect place for a flock of angels too." Primus views millions of glowing aura that include bright, weak, strong, and sickly people among the human race that lives, thrives, and finally dies here on Planet Earth.

In front of the wooden railing in the appearance of a chopped down spruce-fir trunk with its bark and bugs, Primus stands wing tip to wing tip in between her father's wings on Caiden and her rescuer's wings on Teague, staring down with a smile at the new sites in the pink colored desert.

Caiden spreads his hand in the air and over the canyon with a stern face. "Primus, do you see...?"

"Where am I? Where do we live? I have never been here." Primus smiles down at the valley and continues to scan the new landscape.

"Wait, Caiden!" Teague leans over the flimsy wooden railing with a single chopped down log over the rough tree bark and roaming bugs, pointing down at the bright colors of at the yellow and red painted town. "Let's re-introduce Primus to her home town. I know it has been a while, since she has last visited," he chuckles and then points down to his booted feet. "We are standing right now on top of an unmarked mountain pretty flat, which has been not-named by the humans," he chuckles with the others. The mountain summit elevation is 12,816 feet up into the sky, almost touching heaven," he laughs. "This particular unnamed lobe and the rest of the named mountain peaks represent the tail end of the mighty Rocky Mountains. The hard rocks that comprise the Rocky Mountains were formed before the mountains were raised by tectonic forces. The oldest rock is Precambrian metamorphic rock that forms the core of the North American continent, dating back to 1.7 billion years ago, which is a little after our angel arrival here on Planet Earth. Ain't that right, Scooter?" He laughs with the others.

"You be right, hoss!" Scooter laughs.

Teague nods with a smile. "As you angel eyeballs view the line of Sangre de Cristo mountain peaks, you will see dull pink and then blue towards gray and white and then purple hues of colors. Here, in the Taos mountain range within the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, these are Proterozoic rock in bluish-gray hue of hard granite that had folded over the erupting pink colored volcanic lava which had formed all these mountain peaks over one billion years ago. We are standing on part of the formation at the tail end of the mighty Rocky Mountains which is called Sangre de Cristo or the Spanish term translates into 'for the blood of Christ.' The Sangre de Cristo Mountain Range is the most important mountain range with the US State of New Mexico here within the United States of America and contains most of the state's high peaks. The range extends up from the desert town of Santa Fe in the south coming up and performing a zigzag pathway around the second desert town of Taos moving ahead the eastern edge on the Rio Grande River and then flowing up towards the state line into the US State of Colorado and the range goes beyond into the central southern part of Colorado, where it first of the mountain valley states.

"There within the US State of Colorado, Blanca Peak is the highest peak within the Sangre de Cristo mountain range. From our flat summit location, if you look due east, that's the highest peak within the Sangre de Cristo mountain range here in New Mexico, which is known as Wheeler Peak at 13,161 feet above sea level and almost touching heaven also," he chuckles with the others.

He smiles. "There really doesn't exist the hardest rock in the world. A rock is composed of very hard earth minerals but it is the bonding process between the earth minerals that could be weak or strong. Here, in the mighty Rocky Mountains range, the rock here is comprised of quartz and cemented with granite, making all of these mountain some of the tougher and strongest rock on the planet," he stomps one of his booted foot on top of the flat and smooth pink tinted lava rock on the edge of the summit. "Right here, the mountain summit is more flat and semi-smooth, without a true peak point that pokes into the roaming clouds. But, all around us over there and there and there, you can see numerous peak top form the highest mountains here. Frazier Mountain Peak is located northeast of us and it glows in pink to gray lava rocks. Old Mike Peak is shown southeast from us and it glows in pink to gray hue of granite rocks. The Hondo Valley is due west from us and shines in pink tinted quartz with a small layer of earth zircon, which is called and mined as the uranium earth element for the humans. Finally, Bull-of-the-Woods Mountain range is located further northeast from us and it is comprised of volcanic rocks in hue of greenish-gray ironstone and white tinted quartz and marble."

Her eyeballs dart in different geographical directions and absorb the colors from the southwest landscape and as primus smiles at her new home.

Teague points down to the valley. "Now, look down the sloped sides of the bluish-gray rock, this summit, which is similar to the other mountain slopes, contains mostly a dull, glassy surface of colored rock which varies in hue from pink to blue to gray and finally white, displaying scattered pods of small native wildflowers or wide groves of dark green tinted fir trees. A few feet below us, there's a small bed of native brightly colored pinkish-purple colored flowers that are not taller than the length of my hand and are called four o'clock, Mirabilis multi-flora and each plant brightens up the rocky landscape and the desert floor. Several feet sideways from that bed of pinkish-purple flowers, there is a pod of five feet tall prairie flowers that looks like a tall weed with a thistle flower in a violet tone on top of the tall spike, instead of designed on the bottom of the plant. This is called a gay feather flower. You can see thick groves of tall dark green fir and spruce trees or small patches of native flowers that cover the higher elevations between some of the blue or pink tinted rock outcrops here on the Sangre de Cristos Mountain range."

She closes her eyelashes and extends her angel senses forward and beyond feeling the warmth of the sitting fowl, the coldness of the reptile species, and all the other wildlife that hide from both the angels and the humans inside the thick grove of trees.

He jabs a finger down at the valley floor with a smile. "You can see the terrain is covered in pink desert soil with pods of tall spruce-fir trees, low plant bushes, scattered ground covers, and smaller plants that all live and thrive here in New Mexico's life zones. The US State of New Mexico is known as the Mountainous State. The state is bisected by the greenish colored Rio Grande River. The landscape ranges from a flat rose colored desert up towards broken blue and pink tinted mesas going higher into the snow-capped peaks on some of taller mountains with some of the longest days of bright, warm sunrays here."

She opens her eyelashes and scans the valley terrain with miles consisting mostly of pink tinted soil with scattered section of green tinted plant and flowering bushes, groves of tall dark green colored spruce, fir, maple and juniper trees, short and squat scattered pods of willowy light green colored sand sage, tall blue bush sage, and yellow tinted bushes. Numerous scattered patches of plants bushes hold red colored berries, dark blue gooseberries, white wild plums, and natural bluish-purple canyon grapes on the tree vines. The flower plant varies in height and colors from an individual tiny pincushion cactus rose in rose hue to long pockets of delicate wood pink tinted roses, medium bushes with purple or white or yellow flowers and then taller bushes in yellow tinted holly berry and cliff rose with red or yellow dogwood bushes. She inhales and breath in the fresh air and new life here in New Mexico.

Teague continues to lean over the dangerous wooden railing without a care and points to the different land sites with a smile. "The closest body of fresh water is Williams Lake which is due south by three miles from our flat leveled summit. Look out at the landscape!"

Primus twists her face and uses her angle eyeballs, surveying the lake surface with a gasp. "O! This is so beautiful. The lake is over 650 feet long and the fresh water is so clear that I can see the shallow bottom of light tan dirt and numerous rocks. The water is surrounded on one side by a grove of tall, dark green fir trees. I can see the reflection of the line of trees in the water like a mirror."

Teague smiles and views the lake also. "Yeah, and surrounding the lake water, there are small rows of rocks, tan colored dirt, and three to five groups of tiny, funnel-like bluish-purple flowing plants which are called Parry's gentian that are only collected around the water here. Williams Lake lies at the land surface of 11,040 and is less than four miles west of Wheeler Peak and three miles south of us.

"Eighteen miles southeast from us, the mountainous village of Angel Fire provides ski slopes and terrain parks. It lies 8,406 feet in elevation with 59 degrees Fahrenheit. Winds come from the northwest at seven miles-per-hour with 81 percent humidity.

"Twenty-one miles due east of our summit plateau, the Red River is a resort town with a population of 480 humans without angels or demons. The resort offers vacation spot for human skiers, hikers, bikers, fishermen, and family fun adventures. Currently the air temperature is dry at 60 degree Fahrenheit. The winds blow southwestern direction at eight miles-per-hour with 71 percent humidity at an elevation at 8,641 feet."

Leaning over the single wooden chopped down tree log, angel Primus smiles at the different mountain peaks as and her angel eyeballs find the location and absorb more of the pretty colors. "It is truly beautiful here in southwest America."

Teague points towards the south direction with a smile. "Now, use your beautiful turquoise angel eyes and follow my finger. The first visual stop is the town of Taos, which is 42 miles south of our unmarked mountain summit. The town is captured by the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and colorful abode buildings of orange, blue, red, green, gray and brown exterior brick stone. Some of the adobe were inhabited by the Native American tribes for centuries, after us," he laughs with the other angels. "That town is an artist colony showcasing array of human painted and sculptured art works items representing the Southwest landscape, wildflower, and peoples. It stands on a mountain elevation of 6,969 feet high the pale sky. The current weather down there is 71 degrees with a western wind at seven miles per hour and 53 percent humidity and holds a population of 5,771 humans and no angels or demons. The weather below is dry and mild with a calm light breeze that doesn't really reduce the heat factor. Up here, the air is dry and cold, sometimes quite breezy with plenty of sunshine and high humidity.

She smiles at Teague, "Wow! You're very knowledgeable about our temporary home."

"I like to impress."

She smiles. "Impress me! You did."

Standing behind his returned daughter Primus, her father Caiden clears his throat and stares down into the valley. "Teague has graciously provided all of us with some minor entertainment points including most of the human settlers that live and thrive down here, which is nice. We all live peacefully with the wildlife and millions of slender, tall fir trees," he points across the dry air and beams of sunlight towards the north with a stern face. "Primus, I would like for you to use your angel eyesight and study the city of Albuquerque which is 133 miles south of our location here in the northern part of US State of New Mexico. Do you see a set of tiny red tinted vertical beams shooting straight upright from the ground and into the pale blue sky towards heaven, but not touching heaven?"

Primus smiles with her new favorite noun, "Yes, Father."

"Now, we will turn our faces and view the western horizon. Please focus your angel eyeballs on the far, far away city of Los Angeles within the US State of California which is 734 miles from our location. Do you see more skyward red tinted vertical beams?"

"Yes, Father."

"Now, we turn our faces and view the southeastern horizon. Look at the city of Miami in the US State of Florida which is 1,987 miles from our location. Do you see additional red tinted vertical beams that shine in the atmosphere?"

"Yes."

"Now, we spin around and view the northern horizon without moving to the opposite side on the mountain summit of 12,100 feet, because you can see them. Look at the city of Denver which is 223 miles north from out location. Do you see more red tinted vertical beams glowing in the clouds?"

She frowns at the lines of individual red tinted beams with puzzlement and fear, "Yes."

He points at some of the individual beams with a sneer. "Each one of these individually red tinted beams is an aura coming from a fallen angel."

She gasps in shock from her ancient studies with the familiar term, "A fallen angel! I didn't know that a fallen angel lived here on Planet Earth. I thought they were all dead or gone or nothingness here," Primus stares at each red colored beam with fearful intrigue.

Caiden waves a hand in the air with a nod. "We, including Teague, me, Jazmine, and all the other angels monitor each and every one of these wicked and evil fallen angels."

Teague views some of the lines of red tinted beams, nodding with a stern face. "The flock of fallen angels came from the bloody battle inside beautiful Garden of Eden, Prims. They sided with that wicked sinful slithering serpent. After the bloody war, the surviving demons were ordered by that slithering snake to stay here, thrive and annoy each human for the rest of their eternal destiny here on Planet Earth."

Primus points at the northern metro city of Denver and views less than fifty individual tiny red vertical lines that present a demon with her eyeballs, "Are you telling me? Each red dot represents a fallen angel, Father."

Jazmine sits on top of one of the stone curved chairs that can hold four adults in the color of sand dirt that matches the dry soil. She stares at the back spine on Primus and sneers out loud, "A fallen angel is the proper reference here that applies from heaven's point of view. However, a fallen angel prefers to be called a demon."

Primus views the pink soil and nods at the proper noun. "Yes, you are correct, Jazmine. A demon is called a demon. So, a demon is really also angel but who has fallen from goodness and grace. So, we are called," she frowns. "What is the word I use for each one of us?"

"A faithful angel, you are a faithful angel, daughter," Caiden nods with a laugh.

"You're a faithful angel, like me, Prims." Teague smiles and extends his arm to her and then wiggles his fingers. Primus extends her arm without touching his longest finger as she stands twenty feet from his stationary body taking in account the total length measurement consisting of half of her eighteen-foot wing span and the other half of Teague's 22-foot angel wings.

Then Teague softly coughs and then sneezes once, recovering manly by wiping the clear mucus with the back of his hand.

She drops her hand and cocks her jaw line wondering about his health concern in silence.

"We guard all life here on Planet Earth including each one of the fallen angels, cupcake." Caiden spreads his arm through the air and identifies some of the vertical lines of tiny red colored beams covering millions of square miles from the mountain summit near the town of Taos.

"Your father is the head of all the faithful angels." Teague whispers in the air as each pair of eardrums capture and hear the soft words. She nods with the new knowledge.

Caiden nods at each one of the tiny red colored lines throughout the atmosphere that he can see with his powerful angel eyeballs. "The fallen angels will live here on Planet Earth for the rest of their eternal days until judgment time comes for the world and the wicked people to be destroyed into nothingness. Each fallen angel will be destroyed into nothingness also."

"But, why?" Primus frowns and studies some of the hundreds of red tinted lines. "Why will each one of the fallen angels be destroyed?"

"You'll re-learn about that secret information some later time but not right now, cupcake." Caiden laughs at each one of the red tinted lines.

Primus frowns. "Each one of the fallen angels lives inside a dark shelter either a short squat building or an enclosed dark apartment, sorta like a human." She pauses then informs. "I know as I had lived with them there on the USA military base in the city of Key West..."

"Each fallen angel also lives inside a dark hole everywhere here on the planet, hoss." Scooter whispers and scans some of the numerous red tinted lines.

"And the fallen angels are spotted exclusively by a red tinted vertical line that shoots from the hidden shelter into the clouds." Veck points one of the red tinted beams jumping up towards dark and cold outer space molecules. He stands beside Bandy at the end of the line in front of the wooden railing.

Primus nods. "Do you always know and study each of their personal travel plans around the globe?"

Teague waves his hand from the geographical direction west towards the east and then from the north towards the south in the skyline and loudly sneers, "Always."

"I don't understand any of this all, this way, and this manner of angel spying on another angel, Father." Primus turns and frowns at her father, only seeing part of his face and sadly ponders the fate of her demon friends and her demon boyfriend in Florida.

Caiden spreads both of his arms and laughs at the numerous red tinted lines. "Think of it this way, cupcake. This is our job here on Planet Earth where we monitor each and every fallen angel."

"We," she gasps, "They are a harmless species of angel-kind, Father." Primus studies more of the individual red lines that cover the atmosphere over the entire land continent of North America, not at the North Pole regions, thou.

Teague sneers. "For the moment..."

"From the moment, I had lived with them. I had eaten, played, and studied with the demon clan inside the Demon Den. I don't understand this manner, this concept, and this idea, Father," she frowns with worry for her demon friends and her demon boyfriend Preston.

Caiden lifts up both arms and his face towards the bright sun, squirting at the clouds up towards heaven. "This isn't our idea, cupcake," he laughs and then drops down his skull, sneering at the red tinted lines that represent a demon here on Planet Earth.

Primus exhales with annoyance and crosses her arms. "The demons are harmless. The demons didn't hurt anyone, including the humans and animals and insects. Now, I understand," she gasps in shock and stares at some of the red tinted lines in the glowing skyline, whispering for her eardrums. "We moved all the time." She stares with her angel eyeballs at the northern metro city of Denver recalling historical her numerous residence into many large and small towns over centuries as a demon. She shakes her brown curls with confusion and deeply worries about all the demons and her boyfriend Preston.

"Daughter, you can see all of the scattered vertical lines of red tinted beams too. Each demon moves to a new city, a new state and a new country all the time here on the planet. I do know that you're right, thou. The evil demons are harmless only for the moment." Caiden back steps from the wooden railing with a grunt and pivots around with a stern face, tromping ahead to one of the naturally curved pieces of stone furniture, spinning around his body and sits down on the top of the stone seat with a sigh. He must instill the deadly danger into his daughter's mind and soul, since she had been living around a den of demons. Now, her precious young life force glows with immediately danger, since Primus has returned back to the angel flock with her loving kin and away from Preston.

He looks down and views his dirty boot toes from tripping over the pink dirt here on the mountain summit. The pink dirt reflects some of the bright rays of sunlight that hides the Angel Haven from nosy demons, since the beginning of time. Caiden deeply inhales and then exhales.

Each angel spins around from the wooden railing and moves ahead towards the same circle of naturally formed sitting furniture made of blue tinted stone, since the beginning of time, sitting down and stares at Caiden, the leader of the angles.

Primus exhales with worry and inhales with deep concern for Preston, spinning around from the wooden railing, viewing a circle of stone furniture on top of more pink dirt. She slowly moves ahead and stops, sitting down inside an empty stone chair beside her father Caiden.

Each one of the other angels stares at the white colored hair roots on Caiden in silence.

Veck exhales with angry and whispers in angel tone, staring at the hair roots on Caiden, "You need to say it, Caiden."

Scooter nods and whispers in his angel timber also, "We know. Now, she needs to know also, Caiden."

Bandy frowns and whisper in angel timber, staring at Primus. "I agree with my friends. She needs to know, Caiden."

Teague looks up and squirts into the bright sunlight, exhaling with worry. "She needs to know, Caiden."

Jazmine sit in the stone chair beside Caiden and stares with a stern face at Primus. "War is coming."

"What war?" Primus turns with a puzzled brow and stares at the white hair roots on her father Caiden.

Caiden looks up and nods to Primus. "The great war of rebellion is coming and it begins between us and them. Angels versus Demons..."

"No!" Primus gasps in shock, "That...that's impossible. I don't believe so."

Teague looks down and nods to Primus. "Prims, if you have lived with the demons for centuries..."

"I wanted to ask about that situation with me and the demons, Father." Primus frowns.

"Now is not the time for that answer," jasmine sneers at Primus.

Teague exhales with worry and frustration. "Prims, didn't the demons talk about...?"

"Didn't the demon clan members talk to me about what type of nice or naughty subject? I don't understand your incomplete question, Teague," Primus turns and frowns at Teague.

Teague views the bright pale blue skyline and searches for any foreign objects that might be identified as a nosy, flying demon. Sometimes, a small flock of the demons soar ahead through the pale blue sky and pass below the mountain summit, viewing only a set of natural looking blue colored rocks, green plant vegetation, and pink tinted soil, without a single thought of inhabitants there.

"Are the demons not planning to start a war with us?" Scooter frowns at Primus.

Primus closes her eyelashes and as her demon mind quickly recalls a brief discussion of a bloody war between the angels and demons. Most of the bragging words had flowed from the parted lips on the two demons, Blaze and Radium. Then Preston had whispered to Priam that there would never be a war between the angels and demons.

Preston lies.

However, Primus had desired to be with her boyfriend Preston and then marry him starting a little family, like a demon couple that continues to live there at the Key West Naval military base. Now, here in her true home on Angel Haven, she has learned that Preston is truly a demon life form while Primus is rightful an angel life form.

Preston lies.

Now, this difference does matter greatly inside her mind, heart, and soul.

Preston lies.

Inside the circle of curved rocks on top of the rose colored soil in the bright sunrays on top of the summit, which forms a set of pretty weird rock furniture, Primus continues to sit on top of the hard blue colored rock surface, which is not uncomfortable to her angel body, exhaling with frustration and opens her eyelashes. Each angel continues to sit on their hard rock chair and stares at Primus with a stern face in silence. She nods to each face with a firm tone. "Yes, there were a set of talking words of a war between the angels and demons. I didn't believe the talk. I don't want to..." she gasps in shock and frowns at her father Caiden. "If you can see each red tinted aura coming from each stationary demon so clearly inside each shelter, then why didn't you try to find me, Father?"

Caiden swiftly stands upright from his rock chair, swiftly sucking his inflated wings back down inside his back spine, and slowly moves ahead to her, wearing a pair of watery eyeballs inside his hazel irises. He stops and kneels at her kneecaps, whispering with pain, staring at her face. "Primus, my angel daughter, I have been searching for you for centuries and centuries and centuries. And finally, I have found you and you have been returned back home, safe and sound, and with me."

Primus starts to sob with her own tears of joy, fear, and relief. Her father loves her. She leans down and hugs him, tenderly pecking a sweet kiss on his wet cheekbone, pulling back with a smile.

Caiden continues to kneel in front of her face and roughly coughs out loud, sneezing a couple of times, standing upright from Primus, clearing his throat. He whips out the used cloth and wipes the wet moisture from his face, removing the cloth, winking with a smile at his daughter. He slowly back steps from her and then stops, sitting back down on top of the shared bench with Jazmine, inflating out his battle wings, smiling at his child in silence.

Inside the circle of hard rock chair, Teague sits beside Priam and stares at the nose profile on Primus, whispering in his angel tone, where each pair of angel eardrums can hear. "Prims, you were hidden from us by Preston." He lifts up the familiar object near his jaw line within her eyesight, nodding with a stern face. "This object is a simple golden tinted satin ribbon. I had jerked from your hair roots. It appears as a simple fashion headband, but it had hidden your glowing white tinted angel aura and your biological body from me and us and the rest of the faithful angels."

Primus leans over from her chair with a gasp and reaches out, touching the flesh on Teague, swiftly snatching the ribbon from his hand. Teague coughs out loud and then sneezes once, wiping his wet mouth with the back of his hand, scooting back towards the end of his rock chair. He flips around and faces the bright sunlight and the winds of the mountain breeze blowing across his face and nose holes, smiling at the fresh air.

In her rock chair, Primus sit upright with a stern face and gently strokes the ribbon, shaking her curls, wrapping the soft satin around her two fingers. "I don't understand here. This is a satin ribbon that a human girl wears." She had worn the golden ribbon in her hair as a ponytail holder at first and then as a fashion headband as a teenager.

"Within the band of nasty demons, your person had been named as Priam." Jazmine sits as close as she dares next to Caiden with a pair of inflated angel wings that glittered in the bright sunlight, staring at Primus

Primus looks up and nods with a stern face to Jazmine, "Yes."

"Priam was a king in Greek society, who used a golden veil..."

"That's an old ancient myth, a story."

Jazmine nods. "The old ancient Greek legend stated that King Podarces had been saved by a golden veil from his impending death at the vicious hands of Hercules. The golden veil had been his protection charm coming from a ransomed Priam. Priam is a Greek word that comes from a Greek girl."

Teague returns back and stares at the nose profile on Primus. "Where do you think the old and ancient Greek myth came from, Prims?"

Caiden nods to Primus. "Wicked demon magic form most of the legendary myths coming from the fallen ones, cupcake."

"Priam was that Greek girl and that Greek girl was you, Primus." Teague nods.

Primus gasps in shock. "So, I guess that I fell down and far with the ancient Greek trick."

"Primus, you were taken from me and your father." Teague frowns.

Primus turns and frowns at her father Caiden. "I don't understand. How was I taken from you, Father? I don't remember fighting for my life or forced to leave your house or your side, Father."

Teague nods. "We didn't really have the specifications of that particular kidnapping action at the moment."

Caiden exhales with worry. "I think it is best here that I start from the beginning. We all here were assigned by our Maker to boot out the evil pair Adam and Eve from the beautiful Garden of Eden, after breaking the rules and committing sins. A very simple task..."

"So, you thought, Caiden," Jazmine laughs.

Caiden nods. "So, I thought wrong. I completely underestimated the difficult situation down here on Planet Earth. When all we had arrived, Adam had formed an army from existing angels that had been sent down to protect the Garden of Eden. And current army of existing angels liked it down here on Planet Earth and they didn't wanna leave paradise either."

"That behavior is so typical of evil life forms. The existing angels wanted their cake and eat it too." Veck sits on a shared loveseat with his girl Bandy, nodding with a sneer to Primus.

"Shut up, Veck!" Scooter wiggles a hand and tosses out an air punch with his angel magic from his sitting chair at Veck, hitting the bicep on his buddy, laughing out loud.

"Hey! No demon coodies on my angel wings, boy!" Veck swiftly stands upright from the shared loveseat and flutters his pair of inflated wings, producing a set of dead feathers as each one dissolves in the air among the bright sunrays. Teague turns and sneers at Veck.

"Shut up, Veck!" Scooter turns and sneers at Veck also

"Sorry, Teague!" Veck sits down with a stern face and cuddles with his girl Bandy, staring at Primus.

Caiden nods to Primus. "Then evil body Adam made the mistake of challenging..."

"Your heavenly orders..." Primus gasps in shock.

"Yeah, each one of the heavenly orders!" Caiden nods.

"A simple celestial skirmish quickly ensued with heavy losses on both sides of the bloody battle. Then Adam left black and blue on body and soul running out into the middle of the rose colored desert sands. Back then, there wasn't much to the planet but scattered pods of tiny dark green scrubs, a few short olive trees, lots of open desert, and tons of deep blue ocean water. Adam took all the animals and his surviving army of fallen angels with him and his wife Eve."

Caiden nods. "Then, when the Garden of Eden was empty of the two evil humans, the surviving fallen angels, only bodies of dead angels, the gardens had been returned back into dust balls and small rose colored pebbles by the Maker. We all gathered up our wounded to retreat back home to heaven. I didn't know you were missing, Primus. You were a baby who was only five angel years old. I did not know this. But you had followed me down with the last of the angel troops against my fatherly orders. When I had discovered that you were missing, I had gathered all of angel legions together and ordered you found. But I couldn't find your person anywhere here on the planet, Primus."

"I am so sorry, Father. I really don't remember that part either for some strange reason," Primus nods.

Caiden swiftly stands with a sad face and advanced back to his daughter, and stops, leaning down, hugging her body. He pulls back with a sneeze and stands upright, coughing out loud, whipping out the wet cloth, wiping of his nose. He slowly back steps from Primus and nods with a stern face. "You were a very young and high spirited child. Your mother had been fighting the battle with me. She had died there on the battle field of pink roses within the Garden of Eden. You had been safely housed inside the angel nursery with the other child angels for your protection and safety. Your mother rarely left you alone during our happy family life. So, I wasn't surprised that you took to locating your mother, after a brief period of absence from your person inside the nursery. You had always been a very inventive child, cupcake. During the battle inside the Garden of Eden, there had been hours of fights, panic, and fear from all the angels. So, you must have, somehow, managed to get out of the angel nursery and off this mountain peak all unseen by your set of angel caretakers." Caiden exhales with his tears of worry and coughs out loud, wiping off his wet face with the dirty cloth. He had remembered the double tragedy of losing his devoted wife and his precious daughter from his life in a blink of an eyelash.

Inside the hard chair, Primus nods with a sad face to her father after centuries of her absence. "I am so sorry, Father. I didn't know. I can't recall any of these events here on the summit." She doesn't recall of any of those acts against her father, her mother and the angel caretakers many moons ago, since her memory can't recall any of the activities as a little angle child. However, Primus does vividly remember each active fun event with Preston, even the first time on the beach.

On top of the shared pink tinted rock loveseat with Caiden in the dull sunlight rays, Jazmine frowns at Primus. "Do you remember any tiny broken fragment of memory that could unfold this mysterious story, Primus?"

Primus shakes her brown curls with her vast memory lost. "The battle fighting is there, but it is very, very fuzzy within my childish memory banks. I remembered hearing a set of faint sounds and seeing a set of faded memories. I don't recall any gardens or flowers within my mind." She smiles with a nod and shares her range of current memories at the numerous Demon Dens throughout the world. "However, I clearly recalled finding Preston..."

"You!" Teague gasps in shock and points with a sneer at Primus, "You were the one that found Preston. How is that even possible, Prims? I can't comprehend that event." He swiftly stands upright from the hard rock seat and growls in angry pacing back and forth in jealous while pondering a social relationship between Primus and Preston.

On top of the rock seat, Primus stares at Teague with puzzlement and continues to explain her childhood experiences as a demon which is part of her true demon history for many centuries. "Well, I stumbled across him. He had been beaten and bleeding..."

"Had that been you or your pair of folded fists, Teague?" Caiden turns and laughs at Teague along with the other angels but Primus. Primus gasps in shock at the words and actions.

"I wish." Teague sneers and continues to pace back and forth in front of his rock chair, after hearing the true words from Primus.

Primus smiles with amusement. "So, I am hearing here that you and Preston are not a pair of social friends, Teague."

"They are a pair of unfriends that like to engage in gruesome and gory bloody fist fights, when they greet and meet during any day or nightly encounter." Scooter laughs.

Primus nods. "Well then, I will file that shared information within in my memory banks for future use." She is curious about the two males as one is angel and the other male is a demon. And they must have met a few times, before Teague had arrived at the USA military base in Florida.

Inside the shared loveseat, Jazmine studies and frowns at Primus. "How did you locate Preston, Primus? You were only a five years old child."

"I guess that I had wondered away from the garden of flowers and walked on top of the ocean sandy beach with the seashells. I vividly recall finding Preston there on the beach." Primus nods.

"Interesting! How far was the sandy beach shoreline from the Garden of Eden, Teague? I don't really remember visiting there, before the battle," Scooter frowns at Teague.

"That doesn't matter, right now, Scooter!" Caiden waves his hand with a sour frown and nods with a smile at Primus. "The important part, Primus is back home where she belongs with us. The second importance item, we are an angel family again."

"That's the right family attitude, Caiden," Bandy claps and smiles with happiness. "Now, we are all one big happy angel family here on top of the summit. Welcome back home, Prims!"

Primus nods with a smile to each angel. "Thanks to everyone. I feel the loving atmosphere of my home throughout my body extending towards my wingtips," she reaches up and touches her temple, rubbing the pain inside her skull, yawning with sleep.

Jazmine frowns. "Your set of angel powers are weakened, Primus."

She drops her hand and frowns at Jazmine. "No, my angel powers are not weakened. I do not believe so. I'm tired from an active day. That's all. This has been a long day and night." Primus yawns again and covers her face with both hands smoothing the weariness and tension from a new place, a few new angels, and a new purpose in her life.

From the shared loveseat, Jazmine quickly stands upright with a stern face from the seat and advances toward Primus with a firm tone. "Yes, you are in a weakened state. I can see fluxes in your aura and feel distress within your mind. However, we must..."

"I'm fine." Primus swiftly stands upright from the chair and stares at Jazmine, who is an unknown female angel to Primus.

"I demand that you must start..."

"Jazmine!" Caiden swiftly stands upright from the hard chair and reaches out, grabbing the naked arm on Jazmine. Jazmine halts with a sneer and continues to study Primus. Caiden releases the arm on Jazmine and turns with a smile to see Primus, slowly advancing ahead, coughing out loud. He clears his throat. "Cupcake, I would like for you to go and take a nap first. Then I would like for you to bathe and get ready for tonight's celebration," he stops and stands in front of her with a grin.

Primus frowns. "Tonight's celebration! What are we celebrating tonight, Father?" The group of younger angels slowly stands upright from their rock seat and stares at Primus in silence.

He laughs. "You!"

Jazmine continues to stand and snarls at the back spine on Caiden, "Caiden! I assist..."

"And I do not," Caiden continues to stand and sneezes once at Primus, wiping off his face with the dirty cloth. "We are celebrating your return and our family life together, cupcake. We like to celebrate our life, every night, here on the summit." He leans over and hugs Primus, coughing out loud, sneezing several times. He pulls back with a sneeze and then a cough, wiping off his wet face with the dirty cloth.

"O! That's so nice, Father." Primus leans over and tries to kiss his cheekbone.

He back steps and points back to the tall pink tinted Tower Building. "Cupcake, do you remember the Tower Building? Your new room is located inside on the top floor." He coughs out loud and then sneezes several time, wiping off his wet face with the dirty cloth.

She nods with a smile. "Yes, I remember, Father. My new bedroom is located upstairs on the top floor. I remember the location." Primus leans over and hugs her father, tenderly kissing his cheekbone, pulling back with a smile. Caiden coughs out loud and then sneezes several times, covering his face with the dirty cloth, nodding to her.

Teague approaches from his rock chair and extends a hand in the air, without touching the edge on her feathers, coughing out loud, wiping the wet mucus with a free hand. He stops and stands beside her nose profile with a smile. "Primus, please, allow me to escort you back into the Tower Building, before the celebration ceremony." Primus turns and smiles to Teague, reaching out, extending her hand and touches his fingertip. He flutters his wings side to side and drops down a set of dead feathers which dissolve in the air waves, coughing out loud and sneezes several times, wiping off the wet mucus with the back of his hand. He coughs and croaks out loud to her. "Can...can you suck in and then tuck down in your set of angel wings? So, I can properly hold your hand, without your wingtips slapping my face," he laughs and then gags, coughing out loud.

"Yes, of course, I can do that." Primus deflates her pair of wings and returns them into a pair of tiny pinky tips, storing them down into her back spine, nodding with a smile.

Teague inhales with a huff of sour breath and then exhales with gulp of fresh, crisp mountain air, lightly coughing out loud and then sneezes one time, wiping the tiny bits of moisture from his nostrils. He grabs her hand and spins them around with a smile. "Thanks!" He tucks her arm into the crook of his elbow and the both of them face the tall, pink tinted Tower Building. "We can move...

"O!" She smiles at the colorful horizon in the western skyline. "The sunset scene lasts forever here in lavenders, pinks, and pale blues. This place is so beautiful..."

"...like you..."

"...and magical..."

"...like you, too, Prims..."

She jerks away from Teague with a giggle, dashes ahead, and then stops, leaning down over the dangerous wooden railing, smiling down into the valley at the first town with happiness of her new home. "O! I wanna say good night to the humans. Good night, humans! I'll see ya'll tomorrow morning," she laughs. The group of younger angels slowly strolls ahead and stops, standing in between Primus, staring down at the town also.

In front of the natural circle of rock furniture, Teague exhales with annoyance at the back spine on Primus and turns with a frown to see Caiden. Caiden waves his hand and motions Teague towards the wooden railing to entertain Primus one more time, before sunset. Teague moves ahead, stops, and stands beside Primus, coughing out loud, staring down at the town.

At the wooden railing in the dull sunset rays, Primus points down to each town with a smile. "The Red River ski resort is over there to the east. The Taos Ski Valley is located in the north. And the small town of Taos is 36 miles south of our mountain summit which is surrounded by 5.4 square miles of rose colored desert sand and a few groves of spruce trees that don't offer much shade, but lots of bugs and sharp pointy leaves for a slowly growing human population of 5,765, not including the non-human species. The town doesn't have a lake of water. But I can see figures of tiny humans moving inside their tiny house. Wait! We reside here on top of the one of the highest mountain peaks in New Mexico. The humans are always outside engaging in outside activities, such like, horseback riding and bicycle rides on a mountain path, rafting on the river currents, snow skiing down the slopes, ice skating over frozen water, and ice fishing in the frozen water, and hot air ballooning..."

Scooter laughs. "The tiny town of Taos is the closest town to our summit hideaway and is also the home to numerous movie stars and politicians and llama races, until me and Vick stopped all of that silly nonsense. Humans are funny species."

Primus gasps in shock. "What! What did you do to halt the llama races?"

Bandy stares and hisses down at the town within the sinking sunset rays. "First, we don't like the humans harming the animals. Second, we don't like the human riding the animals. Third, we like to harm the humans instead."

Primus gasps in shock. "What!"

Scooter nods with a smile and whispers with his angel tone. "Me and Vick morphed into a pair of two ugly llama mammal and joined the silly mammal race, entering the fun event which ended up embarrassing the two of the human riders and all of the human spectators. That was some time, wasn't it, Veck?"

Veck laughs with a nod. "I wished that we could do more harm to the humans also."

"That would be very careless and dangerous, Veck. You might get harmed instead." Bandy laughs and stares down at the town of humans.

Primus frowns down at the town. "Wait! We are up here. They are down there. How do you keep a solo hiking human or a group of nosy humans away from our home here top of the summit mountain? How do we disguise our presence and scent and noise from the people of Taos?"

"Hum!" Veck sings out loud with a harmonious hum.

Bandy continues to stare down with laughter at the town. "This tiny, laid-back, artsy, fartsy community is also home to an unusual mystery, a resident hum from an unknown origin, which his called the Taos Hum."

Teague continues to stare down with laughter at the same town also. "Have you heard of the Taos Hum, Prims?"

Primus continues to stare with puzzlement down at the same town. "No. Should I have heard of the Taos Hum?"

Scooter continues to stare down with laughter at the same town. "On each pair of eardrums on every human there within the town of Taos, there is an on-going low frequency audible noise that invades the outer boundaries of the village and affects the hearing of every person. That audible noise is known at the Taos Hum."

Teague slaps his chest with a laugh. "However, we make the audible hum when we fly around with our angel winds through the airwaves and we whisper with our angel voice up here on top of the tall summit. Then our angel sound drifts down from the clouds and echoes throughout the dry air into each pair of human eardrums. Honestly, we don't do it on purpose. It just happens. So, we are the mysterious unidentified Hum sound which produces that subtle noise coming from the mountain peak, flowing down into the town that affects each man, woman, child, toddler, teen, and senior citizen."

"O!" Primus frowns down with a sad face at the town of Taos. "Does that...?"

"This is the current time now," Caiden claps with a stern face. "We all need to get inside and cleaned before the nightly celebration, Primus. Teague, escort her back to the Tower Building. Then he will come back and escort you to the nightly celebration, Primus. I'll see you within the hour at the dance."

"Yes, Father!" She frowns.

"Yes, Caiden!" Teague leans over and grabs her hand, back stepping from the wooden railing, swinging them to face the tall Tower Building during the last light of day.

Inside the circle with a curved row of natural rock furniture pieces, Jazmine stands beside Caiden and watches the back spine on Teague and then Primus, whispering out loud through her angel tone towards the strolling couple. "Teague, please, return back here to me, immediately, after your task."

"Yes, Jazmine." Teague holds Primus' hand and whispers out loud with his angel tone back to Jazmine, swiftly dashing ahead into the angel training tower. He inhales a gulp of fresh air molecules and holds his sour breath, wiping off the tiny bits of moisture from his two nose holes.

In front of the wooden railing, overlooking the valley, the sunset rays gleam out the last rays of sunlight at 8:30 pm in the late evening. Veck, Bandy, and Scooter, each angel spins around from the wooden railing and strolls back through the nighttime cold air toward the circle of rock furniture, standing in a loose huddle with both Jazmine and Caiden. Each one continues to stare through a pair of angel eyeballs at the dark and non-glowing entrance door on the Tower Building.

Primus and Teague have disappeared into the lobby room.

Within the circle, Jazmine nods to the dark building with a stern face. "Primus, she has been greatly weakened through her unknown and mysterious childhood and teenage past events, when she had been mishandled by each one of the fallen ones."

Scooter looks up into the dark night sky and starts to back step from the huddle. "Please, excuse us! We must get going..."

"No!" Jazmine nods to Scooter, Veck, and Bandy. "No! I would like for each one of you to shift some of your angel work tonight to Jekusiel and his band of merry angels. I need for each one of you to stay here and listen to this very important discussion, before the dance."

Scooter stops with a gasp and looks down, nodding to Jazmine. "Yes, ma'am! No prob! We're only interested in one certain sandy location off the coast of Gulf of Mexico, right now." He reaches over and pops the bicep on Veck, laughing out loud. Veck nods with a laugh.

"I'm surprised you waited so long before leaving here tonight." Bandy frowns at her boyfriend Veck.

Veck nods. "I was obeying Caiden's orders."

"I must obey the rules, whether I and they like it or not. Ain't that right, boys?" Caiden laughs.

"Right, sir." Veck laughs.

Jazmine exhales with annoyance. "Go and follow my order, Scooter and Veck. Then, both of you return back here without playing around with the rock structures either. Do you understand me?"

"Yes, ma'am." Scooter nods.

Scooter and Veck, each one bends down at their kneecaps and leaps up from the hard rock ground, smoothly flying through the night air here within New Mexico, swishing a pair of wings for extra height in the sky, swiftly flying towards a group of air-borne angels. The other group of angels do not know the new information, but they are going to fly towards the US State of Florida and annoy Preston and his nasty demons during the long nightly hours, until six am tomorrow morning with some angel fun and games.

From the entrance door, Teague appears with a smile and looks up with a gasp, seeing his air-borne friends. He dashes ahead from the archway and leaps up from the stone base into the air, exploding out his 22 feet of angel wing, chasing after the duo.

On top of the summit, in front of the circle of hard rocks, Jazmine points down at the pink dirt in silence.

Caiden and Bandy drop down in a cross-legged pose on top of the cold rock. Jazmine sits down also and shakes out her wings in the cool breeze, placing her palms down in the lap, closing her eyelids. She inhales gulps of fresh air and then exhales a stream of sour breathes.

Caiden and Bandy imitates Jazmine's cleansing routine using their wings, their lungs, and their nostrils also.

In the loose circle on top of the dirt, Bandy continues to close her eyelashes and shakes out her wings. "Moving our group meeting out here in the fresh air and away from the enclosed room inside the Tower Building was a very good idea, Jazmine. I can finally rid the stench of demon coodies from my body."

Jazmine exhales with a nod and continues to wiggle her wings up and down, riding the stench also. "That was my first mental thought and my first scientific test, which hadn't gone well as planned. I would've liked."

"Your idea worked." Caiden continues to shake out his wings and wears a stern face.

"So-so." Jazmine frowns.

"I can breathe so much better out here." Bandy smiles.

Jazmine continues to shake out her wings and exhales with sour breathes with closed eyelashes. "This is an adequate situation for the time being. However, we must..."

"... rest and recreation too, like us, Jazmine," Caiden stops the cleaning of his wings and stares through the air waves at nothing but the twinkling stars and dark night. "Primus needs lots of rest and sleep also. She needs to start exercising and strengthening her wings, maybe, flying around with some of the younglings in their first solo class, that would be good for her..."

"Primus, she can fly." Bandy frowns.

Caiden nods to the air waves. "That is an excellent suggestion, Bandy. Primus can fly with you. I'll inform Primus of her next assignment and lessons, tonight, while we are at the dance. Is that your recommendation also, Jazmine?"

"Primus must un-learn." Jazmine opens her eyelashes and sneers into the air waves, without viewing Caiden or Bandy.

Bandy frowns. "Primus must un-learn to fly. I thought she did a good job swooping off the balcony ledge inside the Tower Building," she laughs.

Jazmine frowns. "That is not my meaning here. Teague knows of my meaning."

Bandy looks up in the night sky and smiles at the array of twinkling stars. "Well, I don't see Teague here or up there. So, I guess he didn't wanna obey your command. He must be there in Florida by now and beating up on poor Preston," she chuckles.

"Teague has studied with me and he clearly understand that Primus must be taught the Un-learneth concept.'" Jazmine turns and sneers at Bandy.

Bandy looks down with puzzlement and shakes her curls with a frown at Jazmine. "Un-learneth, is that with or without a hyphen?" She laughs out loud at the strange angel term. Jazmine is an ancient angel with a set of old and ancient angel skills, which are sometimes really scary to view and hear.

Teague appears in the dark skyline beside Veck and Scooter and then each one slowly drops down, lands on top of the rock. Teague stands beside Bandy without deflating his wings and smiles down at Jazmine. "This task will be relatively easy for Primus," he sits down on top of the rock chair and sucks in his exposed wings back into his back spine, sounding with a chuckle.

Veck parks beside Bandy and sits down in a cross-legged pose on the dirt, sucking in his wings back into his spine and stares at Jazmine, holding Bandy's hand with worry and love.

Scooter sits beside Veck and sucks in his wings into back spine while staring in silence at Jazmine.

Caiden, Jazmine, and Bandy continue to sit and then suck in their individual angel wings back into their back spine.

Bandy turns and winks at her man Veck. "You came back swiftly."

"Preston is a wussie." Scooter laughs.

"Well, there is always tomorrow night at 6:00 pm." Veck laughs.

"And there is the next tomorrow night at 6:00 pm." Teague laughs.

Scooter laughs. "And the next tomorrow at..."

"You, boys have until eternity here." Caiden laughs with a nod to the trio of males.

Jazmine clears her throat without the wet mucus and nods to each face. "Listen to me. We are discussing Primus."

Teague turns with a smile and nods to each face. "The concept of Un-learneth is relatively easy here. Primus must unlearn all of her learned set consisting of each nasty demon mind memory that she has acquired, since she was five years old in angel years."

Veck whistles and shakes his bone skull. "That's a set of long, long, long years and years of nasty demon memories."

Scooter nods. "Are you saying that her acquired demon memories are haunting Primus? I didn't feel that turmoil emotion inside her mental mind, Jazmine."

Jazmine shakes her curls and her hand at the same time. "No. No. No. Mentally, Primus is not experiencing a sets of nightmares or daydreams. She is trapped in between her demon and angel memories inside her mind, not inside her body."

Veck frowns. "I thought the concept of Un-learneth was only related to brain matter, not our sleepy-time dreams."

Jazmine nods. "Yes, you are correct Veck. Her mental mind memories are deep sensations and are not alone located inside her brain cells. Her past historical brain memories live both as an angel and as a demon, right now."

Teague frowns. "But, right now, Primus is trapped inside her set of demon memories."

Jazmine nods at Teague and turns to see each face. "Teague understands as he has trained with me for centuries. On top of her brain, her demon memories exist. While her hidden angel memory resides, like wet clay mud, on the bottom of her brain, so to speak."

"So, her angel memories are blocked down inside her brain from reaching the top of her mind." Veck nods.

Jazmine exhales. "Actually, her angel memories are buried underneath all of her nasty demon memories which reside on top of her mind. Her mind is the strong and overlays her entire brain matter."

"So, we destroy all of her demon memories. That sounds easy," Scooter nods.

"No!" Caiden gasps in shock. Scooter, Veck, Bandy, and Teague turn and frown at Caiden. Caiden disagrees with Jazmine's nasty idea that affects his daughter and her recovery back into an innocent angel, instead of a nasty demon.

Bandy frowns. "If we can create a bridge into her angel memories, then can we link her to our angel world? Then we can purge or get rid of all of her demon memories from her mind, isn't that right, Jazmine?"

"Then all of her demons will be all gone. Good bye! Good ridden! I like the way you think, honey." Veck turns and smiles at his girl, leaning over, kissing her cheekbone.

Jazmine shakes her curls. "No! An internal mental bridge inside her mind will allow each one of her demon memories will ran across the bridge and then reconnect back to her entire memory base."

Scooter frowns. "Okay. So, that novice bridge concept doesn't work. What is going to work to dissolve all of her internal demon dreams? I don't understand. What are you suggesting here, Jazmine?"

Jazmine nods. "Primus must perform the Un-learneth concept and unlearn each one of her demon memories." Caiden and the group of younger angels must also understand the concept and the mission here, if they all want to help Primus.

Veck nods. "How does Primus want to do that?"

Scooter nods. "What do we do to aid Primus with this here, Jazmine?"

Bandy frowns. "What does Primus do with her extracted demon memories? Does she seal them into bottle and then set it afloat in the oceans waters going back to Preston in the US State of Florida?" she laughs with Veck and Scooter.

Teague smiles. "Jazmine has provided the simple solution here, where each one of her demon memories can't hide inside Primus mind anymore."

Caiden exhales. "But the demon memoires and my daughter reside and exist together. So, they do exist." He loves his daughter and accepts that she holds both demon and angel memories, comprising her past childhood and her present teenage character. He wishes Primus could forget about her past experience with the demons and Preston, but she cannot. And he wants to dump Jazmine's plan of action, exhaling with worry.

Jazmine sneers. "They do not exist. Her demon memories simply have created a new memory pattern that overlaps her precious angel memories."

Scooter nods. "O! I get it now. That's why she doesn't recognize anyone of us here at the Angel Haven, because her angel memories are blocked by her active demon ones."

Jazmine nods. "Exactly, Scooter! Once she had accepted each demon memory, she couldn't actively think about her old angel memories. The demon events have become easier to view through the real world and linger or learn inside her mind."

Veck frowns. "O! You're referencing that golden veil regarding that Greek king, who was named Priam and who used the veil to ransom back his life force. But, in reality, Primus has been ransomed one, so the demon clan went ahead and re-named her as Priam too." He shakes his baldness her improper treatment.

Teague sneers, "Yes, you are correct, Veck. That little golden satin ribbon had opened her mind and then dropped down each one of her rotten demon perceptions while blocking out her good angel ones."

Bandy nods, "But, Primus lives here in the real world for millions and millions of years like us, where has not dreamed each one of the demon events, but acted in them."

Jazmine smiles at Bandy. "That is an excellent description, Bandy. Primus has lived and experienced the real world, like us. Now, she must stop living in that fake world with them. She must come to the understanding that she wants to live here within the real world with us."

Bandy smiles. "Does Primus want to live with the angels and not the demons? Is that right, Jazmine?"

Scooter frowns. "How does Primus stop living in a fake world? The fake world is real to her and holds all her demon memories. And all of her demon memories are real and associated..."

"...Preston..." sneers Teague.

Jazmine nods. "It is practically impossible to destroy the demon world inside her mind. Therefore, we will construct a new set of angel memories with the concept of un-learn."

Teague nods. "The more Primus focuses in on her connection to the demons; the more she will deepen that nasty demon connection inside her mind, her heart, and her soul."

Scooter nods. "So, we don't want her to do that and we wanna halt and stop it."

"Indeed!" Jazmine nods. "If we purge out all of the evil demon events, then we will make their nasty demon connection lost or loosen and then we flood her with new memories..."

"... of angel feelings and love from us." Bandy turns and winks at her angel guy.

Jazmine claps with a nod. "Exactly discussion here tonight! I do believe that everyone understands. Now, we will start to create her new set of angel memories in the present first. It behooves us to make it easier for each other and keep things very simple here. We start with walks, talks, and chats of angels without references to the clan of nasty demons there in Florida."

Teague nods. "Understood!"

Jazmine nods. "We, like all nature beings, love to make a connection to a familiar thing. We feel energized when we make a connection. Her angel connections are blocked. Her demon ones are active. Just remember that simple concept! Then she can success. As her demon wiring becomes weaker and less able to control her past feelings, her new angel perceptions coupled with her new angel feelings will become stronger, taking priority and then releasing or purging all of her nasty demon memories. The end! So, simple!" She laughs.

Veck frowns. "So, the concept of Un-learneth is really to forget or bury or overwrite all of her overall angel and demon memories."

Jazmine laughs. "No! Not all of her memories will not be overwritten using the concept of unlearn. I am reminded of a human term: use it or lose it. This is very apropos."

Teague laughs, "Lose it!"

Jazmine nods. "Her past events with the demons have created the demon memory. This is a vital key to the concept of Un-learneth."

Caiden frowns. "No, Jazmine! No! I forbid all of this."

"What do you forbid, Caiden?" Scooter frowns.

"I am referencing the word, Accipio." Jazmine nods.

"Accipio, what does that mean? I have never heard of that word," Veck frowns.

"Accipio is a Latin word that means, to be indebted to one's self." Jazmine nods. "These demon events were not pre-determined for Primus as an angel. Each demon event only exists inside her demon memories, which can be altered, permanently."

Teague laughs. "Her demon memories can be more than altered. They can be lost in both space and time."

Caiden shakes his bone skull with worry. "This is too dangerous for my daughter, Jazmine."

Scooter shakes his ponytail, agreeing with Caiden, if his own brain cells are comprehending the applied concept of Un-learneth. "Yeah, I agree with Caiden. This is very dangerous for Prims, Jazmine!"

Veck nods. "Tell me! Tell all of us! How dangerous is the concept of Un-learneth for an angel, Jazmine? How dangerous for Primus to unlearn or lose all of her demon memories inside her brain matter?"

Jazmine exhales. "To use the concept of Un-learneth on each one of her nasty demon memories, Primus must focus on one past historical event and then she must change that past historical event by touch using all of her new angel talents. Then each one of her nasty demon memories will be deconstructed..."

"...hopefully along with that nasty demon smell," Veck turns and fist-bumps with Scooter, laughing out loud.

Scooter laughs. "Hey! I like that demon stench. I feel manly and devilish."

"Hey! I don't like that demon perfume. I feel dirty and daring," Bandy laughs.

Teague reaches down and scoops up the pink dirt from his home here at Angel Haven, smashing his bend fingers into a folded fist with force as if it was Preston's real head. He softly whispers with a sneer, "So, Primus really is a demon, my worsest nightmare." He has studied with wise and ancient angel teacher Jazmine for centuries and has been taught the un-learn concept inside his sharp mind. However, Teague doesn't want to believe in his heart that Primus must perform the concept of Accipio, which is also a too dangerous, deadly, and deceptive tool for him and her. However, if his intense studies from the set of ancient scrolls that are buried down inside the hidden underground caves underneath this mountain peak is correct that affects Teague and Primus, then he possesses high hopes that Primus will instantly recall her angel life with him, with her biological father, and with the rest of the flock of angels.

Based on her current demon behavior, Primus has been captured in body and soul as a demon teenager along her stinky, sweaty, and nasty demon odor emitting out from each one of her delicate wings. After her bathing tonight, Teague hopes Primus has been cleansed of the disgustingly stench.

On top of the pink dirt, Jazmine exhales with worry also. "We must have faith, here, Teague. Primus is safe with us. The unlearn process must begin tomorrow morning at first light which is five am, as the sun rays are racing across the rock surface. The sooner, the bestest for each one of us and for Primus."

Teague nods to Jazmine. "I understand my purpose. I will be involved and escorting Primus from start t to finish as she enters and then finally ends Accipio."

Jazmine turns and nods to the other young angels. "Yes, Teague will be accompanying Primus from the start to finish of Accipio along with your three dear and devoted friends, Veck, Bandy, and Scooter. They are here to assist and protect you, too, Teague."

"I'm here to help." Scooter nods.

Veck leans over and winks at Bandy. "I'm here to please."

"I'm here to do something," Bandy laughs.

Caiden exhales with worry for Primus and the other four young angels, whispering out loud for each pair of angel eardrums. "Time for the dance! Go and quickly get ready, washing off that demon stench, before the rest of the flock gets confused, angry, and mad at me," he stands upright from the dirt with a sour frown and bends his kneecaps, leaping up from the soil, quickly flying towards his residence building on top of the largest structure. He disappears through a wide window without a glass pane in between the two wooden frames and readies for the dance also.

On top of the dirt, Veck swiftly stands upright first and leans down, assisting his girl Bandy to stand beside him. They cuddle and then shuffle ahead to her individual pink tinted, short, squat building that holds each single female angel while readying for the dance.

Scooter stands upright with a smile and dashes ahead towards the blue rock coated short, squat buildings that holds each single male angel, getting ready for the dance. He disappears into the entrance door.

On top of the dirt, Teague stands upright with worry and moves ahead, leaning down, assisting Jazmine to stand upright beside him. She holds his arm with a stern face. They slowly stroll side by side and moves ahead towards the Tower Building.

Jazmine softly whispers only to him in her angel tone. "Teague, Primus exists in a very fragile of mind and body, at the moment. So, she is going to be talking a lot about her demon life and a lot about Preston." Teague sneers. She pats his arm with a nod. "This is what I mean by very fragile within her mind and her body. You are the mature angel here. She is the young one. So, you must control your feelings and emotions around Primus. She has lived with the demon clan for 250 million years. She doesn't know any better here."

Teague growls. "Her angel side does and can and will and should..."

"Shame on you, Teague! I just explained to the others that her angel memories inside her mind are blocked. The small amount of her angel memories which she carries are not on the surface but buried down deeply within her sub-conscious. Once she has performed and completed the unlearn concept, Primus will come back and become her wonderful self, like she had been centuries ago."

The first light touches her nose bridge and tickles her two closed eyelashes. Inside her new private angel bedroom, on top of the soft mattress with piles of white colored blanket, a newly discovered angel Primus opens her eyelashes and stares up at the glass ceiling with a smile, seeing the streaks of new sunlight race over the 12,867 feet summit base.

She wiggles side to side and rolls off the soft mattress, standing upright with happiness, slowly moving towards the row of windows. She stops and reaches out, sliding a free hand in between the two wooden frames, gasping in shock. "The glass is not presence here. There isn't a single glass pane inside any of the wooden window frames. I didn't figure that out yesterday."

She looks up and smiles at the glass dome inside her new bedroom, narrowing her eyelashes without seeing glass twinkles. She gasps in shock. "So, it was an angel trick. My father used his angel magic and covered each naked frame with an invisible force field, where I could not escape. I didn't know that an angel could do that. A demon can't do that. Preston can't do that," she exhales with worry. "I care for Preston, but he lies all the time. I was the angel there and here. He was the demon there and here."

She stomps her naked foot and shakes her curls looking back down at the row of windows without glass panes, "Stop thinking about him! He is not here. I am here. He is the demon. I am the angel. Angels versus Demons," she spins around with worry and slowly moves ahead without rushing, viewing the naked walls inside her room. Her single bedroom space is the same space from yesterday and displays three walls of smooth blue colored stone without a single piece of art work or wall decoration and a row of wooden window frames.

Scooter explained yesterday how a surviving angel from the battle inside the Garden of Eden had raised the natural rock surface on top of the unmarked summit and then molded the short and squat abode houses, which had disguised their tiny community from any and all invaders.

Primus exits her new bedroom and stands inside the open archway, staring at the blue colored rock walls. She had missed with her eyeballs and thankfully with her flapping angel wing tips yesterday also.

She enters the wardrobe closet and changes into the same halter dress in white hue with the matching slippers, inflating her angel wings, shaking off the dead feathers. Each dead feather drops down and then disintegrates into white dust before hitting the smooth wooden floor, drifting through the air waves, traveling through the open windows into the sunlight.

She slowly spins around and exits the closet, and then her room, carefully climbing down a wooden staircase viewing more blue tinted rock walls, landing down on the first level of pink tinted dirt.

The solid wall without a window or art work allows the younger angels to bounce off the curved rock surface and twirl around the air waves for fun while practicing their flying skills.

The wide triple-sized entrance archway does not contain a wooden door as the door is magically sealed with a friendly force field that keeps out the flying bugs and the drifting sand dust from the interior level of the building.

She strolls ahead and exits the building, moving outside to meet the first light from the sun with a smile. The air temperature is cold and dry on her inflated wings as her body is chilled from the southern winds.

From the Tower Building, the pink soil forms a large courtyard with scattered pod of short fir trees and sand bushes appearing like a natural plateau instead of a community of angels.

No other angel is awake and strolls around the compound.

Primus stops and leans over the wooden railing viewing each small town below. The desert valley is flat, bland, and dull looking. She sniffs the air waves and then coughs out loud, covering her hand. "Yeah, I can see the stinky humans in their bed frame all asleep too. No one wonder Teague and the others cough all the time."

She tilts her head and listens to the wind vibrations, squawking birds, and moving rocks, without hearing the mysterious Hum sound that Scooter had described last night.

However, Primus had remembered the clear sounds of each bell-like tone from the Ringing Rocks inside the Stony Garden which was located on the northwest sloped side on Haycock Mountain in Bucks County within the US State of Pennsylvania near the rural town of Bucksville.

The garden of stones appears as a series of disconnected boulder fields which extend for half a mile along the mountain base. The garden of ringing stones had been formed where the olivine diabase unit runs along the bottom of the Haycock Mountain.

The ringing rocks natural site is accessible by a nature hiking trail for a human, where a winged creature, like a demon, can fly over each boulder fields and then plop down hard on top of each smooth boulder, creating the beautiful musical tones.

Preston and Primus had done that fun adventure while residing in the rural town of Bucksville several years ago.

She opens her eyelashes and softly giggles at the wonderful daydream, exhaling with worry about Preston He doesn't know that she had really disappeared from the military base within the US State of Florida, last night. Well, he deserves to be with his kin, the demons.

And Primus needs to stay with her kind, the angels.

The Ringing Rocks memories has triggered the soft swishing sounds coming from the Gulf of Mexico ocean waves.

On the Key West main island and the rest of the surrounding island, the land foundation is exposed portions from an ancient coral reef. About 130,000 years ago, during the Ice Age, Key West islands had been covered in ice. 15,000 years ago, the ice had melt and exposed the coral reef, creating the Key West islands,

She quickly recalled each flowing ocean waves gently slapping against the hard wet sand during the early morning hours as she and Preston cuddled on top of the wooden picnic table and enjoyed the new day, softly chatting with smiles and giggles.

Primus exhales with worry and then smells the flowing air waves and then grins with silliness. Her two nose holes smell his body fragrance of cinnamon and pine scents approaching from her left. Primus stands upright and continues to stare down into the desert valley of pink and yellow hues.

Teague appears with a smile and wraps a thick white tinted blanket around her upright body while quickly damping her nasty demon smell. He cuddles Primus and shuffles her backward from the wooden railing, slowly spinning around, leading ahead toward a new squat building made in pink tinted rock. He leans over and softly chatting about varied subjects.

The squat building lies on the edge of the flat pink colored plateau behind a row of taller buildings that house numerous single female and male angels, shadowing the shorter rock building into coldness without the western sunlight. The door-less entrance way faces the western horizon with a single guardian angel.

Scooter watches at the door-less archway and nods to Teague and Primus. She wears a pile of blanket around her shoulders that covers her new angel white uniform and white cowgirl boots.

"Morning, everyone." Teague greets with a nod and enters through the archway.

"Hi, Teague, Primus!" Scooter continue to stand guard and salutes his friendly gesture with his two finger pads from his forehead as Primus giggles. "Are you feeling cold, this morning, Prims?" He acutely notes the heavy blanket over her petite body and sniffs up less of her stinky demon odor, nodding at Teague's new creative idea containing the traveling stench.

Teague winks with his brotherly secret to Scooter. "All of us have acquired a viral cold coming from the cool and damp mountain air from numerous last nights. I don't want Prims getting sick or catching our yucky dirty germs." He chuckles with his angel brother and moves into the large room, passing a row of sitting angels on top of the hard pink tinted floor.

"Right on! I mean, right so," Veck continues to sit on the floor and looks up with a wink at Teague, sniffing the drifting air waves that contains a small amount of her nasty demon odor. Her thick blanket performs its good job. Teague is a smart angel.

Teague pads around a semi-circle of sitting angels and stops, forming part of the huddle, assisting Primus to sit down on top of the hard floor, quietly sitting next to her, nodding with a smile to each angel in silence.

Primus sits with a smile and continues to smell the essence of cinnamon and pine coming from Teague that invades her space making her feel comfortable and safe next to him.

The body scent from angel Teague is different from the demon odor on Preston that smells like polished leather and citrus.

Scooter enters the room and sits on the opposite side Primus, reaching out, touching the blanket.

Primus can smell a distinct combination scent of musk, eucalyptus, and oak moss bombarding her nostrils coming from Scooter's angel body.

"Hurry up and finish your breakfast, hoss. We got lots of angel business due today." Scooter smiles at Veck, who sits slightly diagonal from his folded body.

Veck looks up and smiles with stuck food particles in-between each dirty tooth.

"Breakfast, this is his third plate. He has moved up to his dinner meal now." Bandy sits beside Veck and reaches over, slapping his arm for fun. Veck looks down and chews the food, swallowing the lump, finishing the breakfast.

Brandy stares at Primus. "How are you doing, Prims? I'm Bandy from yesterday. This is my angel guy, Veck."

Primus smiles. "Hi Bandy. Veck. Scooter. I feel very good and refreshed from sleeping, so well. Thanks for asking. And my wings are healed. I can show..."

"No." Scooter screams with a gasp.

"No." Veck yells with a sigh.

Bandy smiles. "That's okay, Prims. Maybe later, we can do some exercises to strengthen your wings," she nods. "I'm one of the flight instructors for the kid-angels. I insist on a set of daily exercises to freshen and cleanse all the fluffy feathers keeping them shiny and sweet smelling..."

"Thanks for your over done explanation, flight instructor Bandy." Teague raises his eyebrow at Bandy while warning her not to bring up the wing thing again which causes problems, until Primus has lost all of her demon memories.

Caiden steps into the same room and smiles at each angel. "Greetings, angels." He swiftly moves ahead and stops in front of Primus. She stands upright and continues to hold the blanket, hugging her father, peaking a kiss on her cheekbone.

Caiden pulls back and coughs out loud and then sneezes, wiping off the wet mucus particles from his mouth and nose with new clean handkerchief, storing the dirty item inside his white vest. He back steps from his daughter and spins around, holding his index finger to his temple from her preview. Yeah, her father is experiencing a fridge ice cream headache, also. He spins around and drops his hand, sitting down beside Jazmine, faking a smile to the other angels.

Jazmine sits beside Brandy and nods with a stern face. "Good morning to all! Thanks for your early morning attendance here today. We will begin Accipio."

"Accipio!" Primus repeats slowly. "Is that a new angel term? I'm willing to be taught all of the angel ways, starting today." She frowns at Caiden and then returns back to see Jazmine, who leads each angel lesson. She ponders her first day of instruction that begins her life as an angel, not a demon.

Preston lies.

Jazmine nods to Primus. "You must Un-learneth."

Primus shakes her curls at Jazmine's odd words with the strange sentence. Jazmine's weird vocabulary is very scary. She views Teague. "Un-learneth, what is that?"

Teague points with a stern face back to Jazmine.

Jazmine clears her throat and nods to Primus. "The term Accipio means 'indebted to one's self' in the Latin language. So, Primus must perform the Un-learneth concept on each one of her memories."

Primus gasps in shock and frowns. "Why must I unlearn each one of my memories? These are my memories that I learned and have kept for centuries..."

The early morning chat is getting really weird. Primus doesn't like the ancient, wrinkled angel Jazmine, who continues to exhibit her set of wickedly magical hat tricks. She turns and frowns at the nose profile on Teague.

Teague won't lie and always tells Primus the truth. Teague points back at Jazmine in silence.

Jazmine sneers at Primus. "We are discussing only your personal demon memories..."

"Yes," Caiden clears his throat and stares at Primus. "How is my daughter Primus going to perform the Un-learneth concept for each one of her old demon memories? Memories are part of our mind. We are a flock of angels. We had existed before and after..."

"Don't start the 'Omega and Alpha' thing here in my presence, Caiden." Jazmine stares at Teague. Teague, you must go and take Primus back into her past, where she will perform Un-learneth concept. Then all of her nasty demon memories using the Accipio procedure will dissolve from her mind."

"Where do we start? There are centuries of memories as an angel or..." Scooter frowns with worry as a member within the important mission that will help Primus come back as an innocent angel again. He admits that the new Accipio concept is faintly vague, foreign, and dangerous within his brain and his body. He turns and frowns at Teague also.

Teague points back to Jazmine in silence.

Primus bounces up and down on the floor with a stern face to Jazmine. "These are all of my memories. If I hear you right, I have both angel and demon memories. Teague talked about my angel memories have been blocked. Then, I can un-block my angel memories. As I can't remember you, you or my father, before the age of five years old. I want to recall all my young angel memories, but, at the same, I want to possess all my good and bad memories like a human does."

Jazmine shakes red curls. "Indebted to one's self means that you have indebted each one of your memories to the nasty demons, Primus."

Primus exhale with worry. "I don't do that, on purpose, here or there or every."

Caiden smiles. "We understand, cupcake."

Teague reaches over and pats her blanket, not desiring to touch her fridge cold demon flesh again. "You were a child. Then you were taken from us as a child. We don't want you to relive each one of these ugly demon times. This is your fresh start as an angel." He nods to her and each angel while helping Primus understand is this her new purpose by involving the Accipio concept.

Primus frowns. "But I am in those same memories both as an angel and..."

She stops with a gasp and shakes her brown curls. She understands perfectly the simple concept of Accipio which is destroy her memory of each Demon Den, where she had lived with Preston all over world for last 50 million years. Within her individual demon memories, she had stored each good and bad fun time with her demon friends consisting of Blaze, Barbie, Radium, Morton, and even demon bad gal Colee.

If Primus willfully performs the Un-learneth concept, then she will lose all traces within her mind of Preston. She looks down and stares at the floor, sobbing silently, holding back her set of painful tears. She exhales and then inhales a set of deep breaths fully recovering from her emotional feeling.

Teague reaches over and gently touches her blanket on her covered collar bone, smiling at her nose profile. He is gently assisting Primus to destroy her past 50 million years of memories with demon Preston. So, she can become an innocent angel, without a single memory of a demon. He points back to Jazmine in silence.

Primus looks up and stares at her father Caiden, instead of Jazmine. She does not want to sacrifice her father again or Teague or her chance as an innocent faithful angel as she is born to become.

Jazmine nods. "Primus, we can only be successful, if you are successful." She turns and stares at each angel, returning back to see Primus. "You must want to change each one of your memories and live without the demon memory past. Only you can lead us into your past demon memory."

Primus nods in silence to Jazmine.

She nods. "You are the key to perform the Un-learneth concept into your historical past. Each demon memory only resides inside your mind, Primus. So, are you ready to lead us, Primus?"

Primus stares at her father Caiden and views Teague, looking down at the floor, returning back to see Jazmine. She decides the correct answer and whispers softly. "Yes."

Jazmine nods. "Primus must focus on one past event and change that event by touch with her new angel side. Then the demon memory will be deconstructed, completely."

"That sounds too easy, Jazmine." Scooter frowns.

"Nothing comes easy here within this worldly plane, Scooter." Jazmine nods. "Now, let each one of us began. We're wasting daylight hours," she swiftly stands and spins around from the circle of sitting angels with a stern face, quickly moving ahead towards a side door on the side wall. she opens the door with one fluid motion and disappears into the room.
Each angel slowly moves ahead toward the same open door and enters into a new room, standing along the wall.

The new room is smaller in size and does not contain a viewing window of sunlight, only one naked bulb of illumination which is mounted on the rock coated ceiling.

Jazmine stops and stands in the center of the room, pointing down the rock floor. "Each angel come over here and sit down in a circle."

Each younger angel strolls to the center of the room and sits down in a circle in silence.

Caiden continues to stay along the entrance wall and stares at his daughter with worry. "How long will this Accipio thing take to finish up, Jazmine?"

Jazmine back steps from the circle of angels and slams into the side rock wall, staring at the rear skull on Primus. "The Accipio concept will take as long as Primus needs to complete her final demon memory."

"Will that be days or months or years or centuries, Jazmine?" Scooter sits down beside Veck and stares at Primus.

"I can accurately calculate with more information, after executing her first demon memory swipe." Jazmine continues to stare at the rear skull on Primus. "Scooter, Teague is in charge of Primus and her safety. You are in charge of each expedition. If anything goes wrong, then Scooter is the new leader for everyone's safety. Do you understand me, Scooter?"

Scooter nods to Teague. "Yes, ma'am." He intuitively knows this weird mission will be more dangerous than spying on each existing Demon Den. He stares at Veck, who nods in silence back to Scooter.

Veck turns and nods to his girl Bandy holding her hand as they both nod back to Scooter in silence.

"All right! We are ready. Everyone is sitting in a circle. Caiden and I cannot join your search party, but we will be located in this room while monitoring your progress." Jazmine nods.

Caiden continues to stand against the entrance wall in silent worry for his daughter and the other young angels.

Teague sits beside Primus. Veck sits next to Teague and his girl Brandy. Scooter sits beside Teague and Brandy. Each one crosses the legs and creates a wide circle.

Jazmine holds a hand next to her nose and mouth, clearly wording her next order. "Primus, you must remove your blanket and inflate your wings."

Each angel mouth nosily gulps inside fresh air molecules and holds their breath as each angel continues to sit in a circle with Primus.

Teague holds his breath and reaches over, swiftly removing her blanket, tossing the item against the entrance wall. he breaks out into a light cough then a single sneeze, wiping the wet mucus with back of his hand, grabbing a new gulp of fresh breath into his lungs.

Jasmine continues to stand against the wall and covers her nose, smelling the nasty demon stench. Some of the younger angels sneeze out loud and then cough, inhaling a set of fresh molecules. She orders. "Close your eyes, Primus. Let your mind wander into one of your past time periods within your life and allow your mental thoughts to guide you directly to that past historical event."

Primus closes her eyelids.

Jazmine says. "Concentrate on one event, maybe, a long time ago, in a simple place and a simple time."

Primus mentally thinks of a specific place and time as she feels her body shift up from the heated floor into a cool light breeze as a series of soft thunder rumbles over her hair roots.

Village of Duns within the country of Scotland

1706 A.D.

Dairy farm location

05:32 p.m.

Sunny sky with scattered clouds

Air temperature 65˚F

Precipitation 0%

Humidity 81%

Westerly winds at 05 mph

The first mind thought from Primus begins in the village of Duns within the country of Scotland, in the year of 1706 A.D., at a cow dairy farm. The farm contains flat green fields which are filled with black and white colored mother cows and each baby calf.

The circle of angels gently land down in the short green colored grass, sitting cross-legged. Each arm is crossed and each eyelid is closed shut without screaming or speaking.

Scooter quickly moves around first and stands upright from the grass, swiftly drawing out his sword from the sheath, surveying efficiently the grounds. He views groves of shade, rows of low yellow tinted plant bushes, pods of colorful flowers, and an uneven lawn around a stately manor that set thousands of feet in an eastern direction. The green pastures team with herds of black and white cows overlooking a lazy stream of bluish-green pond water.

Veck, Bandy, and Teague swiftly stand upright from the ground and draw out each sword, readying for any sudden violent action or small swift movement.

Primus slowly stands upright from the grass with her inflated wings and stares at the red barn as her pair of angel eardrums hears two different voices coming from two different sexes.

Teague reaches out with his free hand grabs Primus' forearm, dragging them from the protective angel circle, moving ahead towards a freshly painted red wooden with a set of double doors, hearing the two different voices also.

Veck shuffles sideways to Scooter and studies the quiet farm pastures. "We don't seem to be interfering with her demon memory. Why's that? What's the reason for that?"

Scooter shakes his ponytail and as his eyeballs slice at the quiet grounds. His acute angel eardrums are alert for any strange occurrences. "Jazmine has speculated that we may not. This is Primus' old mental mind memory. We are only background noise like static on a vocal radio devise, if you can't find the right musical station."

"Then, we can't change the future and all that jazz." Veck continues to study the quiet environment of farm crops and grazing cows.

Brandy shifts closer into their soft conservation.

"Jazmine repeatedly told me some of her vague and useless information, when I had proposed that particular question to her angel brains." Scooter points at the blue jay on the dirt fighting for its meal with a wiggling earthworm. "do you see that bird over there? The bird doesn't acknowledge or see or feel or sense our presence."

Veck sways back and forth with nervousness and turns to see the bird also. The bird snatches the worm out from the earth hole for a good cause, its supper meal. He smiles down at the bird. "That explanation and his view is good enough for me."

"How long will this take?" Bandy stares at the cracked door on the barn and as her angel eardrums continue to hear the faint voices, watching for Teague.

Scooter exhales with worry. "This Accipio event is going to depends on Primus and how devoted she is to our angel mission."

Bandy frowns at the cracked door with worry. "That's not a fair statement, Scooter. She's scared. She's upset. I would become upset, if I had to lose all my angel memories too."

Scooter nod. "And this is all unfair to us, angels, too, Primus possesses all of her demon memories, Bandy, not her angel ones. The demon ones are very dangerous and very deadly for her and for us. You must remember. This angel mission isn't just for Primus, it's for us who are trying to save Primus too."

"If Primus can't purge out all of her demon memories, what happens to her and us?" Bandy continues to worry for Teague and primus inside the barn.

Scooter continues to survey the landscape and stares at the herd of grazing cows. "That is not my personal angel decision. That is for Caiden to decide."

"Or will Jazmine decide?" Bandy frowns.

"Jazmine seems to understand some other ways other than the nice angel ways, to me." Veck turns and frowns at Scooter. "Does that bother either one of ya'll?"

Scooter nods in silence to Veck.

Bandy nods in silent and continues to stare at the barn door for a set of fiery fireworks.

"Scout out!" Scooter orders as the commander of the mission to Bandy and Veck.

Inside the barn interior, Primus hears a string of loud words coming from a female and stands against the wooden entrance wall, gasping in shock. She back steps and slams into the chest on Teague.

Teague blocks the parted entrance door and does not allow Primus to escape back into the present time on Angel Haven. He understands everything.

Primus has to fix all of her demon past lives, so she can live out her angel future with him for eternal.

Primus stands in front of Teague and sobs with fear feeling her deeply embedded demon emotions, staring at the repeating picture from one of her numerous past demon memories.

A string of loud thunder roars in the skyline. Bolts of bright lightning dances across the black clouds. Then a sheet of tiny raindrops falls down from each thunder cloud.

Teague back steps through the open door and studies the sky as the time is almost six pm, which is Curfew. He spins around and views each angel as each scatters over the farm grounds while watching everything and everyone.

Teague spins around and hugs Primus, sniffing her vanilla fragrance, not the stinky demon odor. Strange!

He will tell that new information to Jazmine, after recording her first demon memory wipe.

Teague leans down and whispers into her eardrum. "Okay. You can do this thing, Prims. We will do this thing together."

Primus continues to stand and stares ahead.

Teague moves ahead and tucks her underneath his armpit, slowly moving further into the barn interior.

A young girl sits on top of a low foot stool and hold both of her naked hands on the cow's udder, trying to squeeze some fresh milk into medium-sized tin pail. She wears a blue and white coarse long shirt down to her ankle bones and a dirty white colored short sleeved blouse down to her naked elbows as her skull is completely covered in a sheer veil color of sparking gold.

You can't see her face, consisting of eyes, ears, mouth, lips or nose, only the long strands from her brownish-golden long hair from her rear skull, floating down to her waistline and the smooth paleness on her neck. Her skin tone glows in ivory hue without seeing he pair of hidden hands underneath the milking dairy cow.

"What! What's that?" Primus points the sitting

Teague quickly analyzes the barn, the animals and the two people. "You!"

"Me!" She gasps in shock and stops bouncing into his chest with fear.

He quickly theorizes based on the studied data from the old scrolls which had been provided by ancient angel Jazmine and the bits of loose verbal information coming from Primus. He whispers down into her eardrum and views the same picture. "Can you see that? You are wearing a golden veil over your face. That girl is you, Prims. The satin golden hair ribbon acts like a filter on you, so you cannot see the real world, the real demon world."

"I remember this vision every detail of it, Teague." Primus studies the faceless girl.

"Do you remember the event as true and read?" He observes that something else is happening.

"I remember the place, the date, the barn. I was finally successful and squirted about a pint of milk from the dairy cow and then we..."

A tall figure emerges from the far corner and tosses numerous yellow strands of loose hay at Priam as she continues to sit and pulls on the cow udder. She quickly removes her hands and picks off each hay strand from the golden veil and her white blouse with a soft giggle.

The veiled girl, who is demon Priam within her own demon memory, calls out loud with laughter. "Stop it, Preston!"

Angel Primus points at demon Priam, which is herself, within her own demon memory. "Preston, that's Preston. But he is colored red hue coming from his head down to his toe. I can't see his face or his body features ..."

"Primus, he is a demon form. The red hue represents his true colors." Teague sneers. "Do you see his inflated wings bouncing up and down on his back muscles?"

"Preston is him. I don't know really know about that or this, Teague." Angel Primus frowns with fear.

"You are looking into your past, the demon past, your own demon past. You are seeing a real event with your real eyes, not the ones you see through the golden veil that covers your face as the other girl, who is known as demon Priam." Teague nods.

"How do you know this to be true, Teague? The event could be flawed in some way by space or time."

"Primus, I have been studying and learning with Jazmine the Accipio techniques for the Un-learneth concept for each one of your demon memories."

She spins around and frowns at Teague. "How long have you been studying the Un-learneth concept with ancient angel Jazmine? I don't like Jazmine and Jazmine's idea of the Accipio concept. I wanna..."

"Since you were taken from me, Primus." Teague hugs her not wanting Primus to leave or quit the Accipio event while feeling her tremble between his two biceps. He shares her fears of fright of this one-way self-destroying celestial procedure. However, the Accipio concept must be completed.

Primus can't stop this process with her lingering doubts. Once she experiences a successful event with her first demon memory wipe, then the rest of her memories will swipe off easier. Primus is very vulnerable and can easily become a prisoner underneath demon Preston again.

Angel Primus pulls back and frowns at Teague. "But Preston possesses a head of blonde hair," she spins around and studies the same picture with demon Prima and Preston. "How can that golden veil control both of my thoughts and my eyes? I see the sparkling gold clearly with my eyes. And if I squint my eyelids, then I can see a part of my mouth..."

"Did you ever remove the ribbon from your hair?" Teague stares at the same picture.

She stares at the two beings in their play of motion like a Hollywood movie film. "I never thought about the ribbon like that. It was a gift from..." Primus frowns. "No, I wore it all the time."

Teague nods. "I know for a fact that Preston stands at six feet and six inches in height with a head of blonde colored hair. You saw every day the real Preston in flesh, blood, and bone. Think of it this way! The veil was used more as shield that protected you from the angels rather than from each demon, Prims."

"What happened between you and Preston?" Angel Primus spins around and stares at Teague,

He sneers and watches Preston, who bounces back and forth from the hay bend and places a piece of hay on the veiled girl. "I don't think that's too hard to figure out, Prims. I'm an angel. He's a fallen one."

"Can't we all be friends?" Angel Primus frowns and spins back around.

The demon Priam and the moving Preston continues to play out the event inside the barn.

Angel Primus exhales with worry, fright and sad emotions which are all rolled into one great big emotion regarding her first demon memory that she will destroy within her soul, her mind, and her heart.

Teague sneers at the demon picture with demon Preston. "Prims, Preston took you away from me. If I ever find him..."

"You know where he lives, Teague."

"I do at that." He spins around and views through the cracked door. Scooter, Veck, and Bandy have accompanied Teague to revisit each of her past demon memories within the Accipio concept, in case, of trouble. Now, Teague understands Caiden's order. His team of angels are here to kill any troublemakers.

"So, the golden veil had hidden me, from me, from you, from my father, and from lots of stuff." Angel Primus continues to view the barn scene while calming down her active mind and her pumping heart.

He spins back around and views the barn scene too. "the veil had hidden you from all the angel stuff, not the demon things. The creatures beside you, tossing the hay strand and colored red is Preston, which is only in your past. In your present, you could see his face in living colors. As an angel, you only see his red aura and pair of blood red demon wings with your set of angel eyes." Teague explains.

"What do I do, now, Teague?"

"Now, you are here and present in your demon past. Now, you are to replace the old demon you under the spell of Priam with the new angel you, Primus." He nods.

"How do I do that, Teague? I still don't understand the Accipio thing."

"You go ahead and touch her shoulder on the collar bone." Teague orders.

"Why her shoulder on the collar bone?"

"Well, any body part will do the Accipio trick thing here, Prims. But, I believe after studying the vivid situation that has presented itself in front of our eyeballs. Her shoulder bone would be the best spot for your quick draw touch. It doesn't move or flutter too much like a waving hand or a shifting foot." Teague instructs with a smile and still protects Primus and observes Preston.

"Good point! What will happen to me or to her or to demon Priam?"

"Well, Jazmine said..."

Primus spins around and growls at Teague. "You don't know either, do you?"

"Well, there is a first time for everything, Prims." Teague smiles. His knowledge of Accipio consists of a wild theory from some dusty scrolls that he had read for centuries under Jazmine's poor vocal interpretation.

No other angel has ever performed the Accipio concept here on Planet Earth.

"I don't want to be the first time for this Accipio thing, Teague." She shakes her curls and sneers.

"If Jazmine..."

"I don't know about this entire Accipio thing, Teague. I..."

He exhales with worry. "Prims, you can see clearly the past event is flawed. You are the missing element here in your past demon memory."

"No. Preston is missing element, who is all colored in red hue, not me. I'm right here with you." She spins around and jabs a finger at the veiled girl.

"No, that's not right. Preston is there in his true form. You are there in your false form. This is the goal of the Un-learneth concept to un-learn or lose each one of your false memories. Or you can live with each one of your false memories, foreverly. Do you want to live forever with each one of your demon memories, Prims?" He worries about her fragile psyche and his bleeding heart.

She exhales with worry. "No, I do not. So, when I touch the girl, what happens next, Teague?" Silence lingers in the air waves. "Teague!" She spins around and stares at him.

He pulls out his sword from the sheath with a stern face and holds in his fighting hand while protecting Primus. Scooter, Veck, and Bandy stand outside the barn as a row of point guards with a sword too readying for a foul action coming from bad boy demon Preston.

He spins her around and shoves Primus towards the veiled girl, "Go, Prims!"

She gasps in worry. "Teague!"

Teague pushes her towards the stationary cow. "Go ahead! Touch the girl, Prims. I will be two feet away from your body, in case, something happens." He turns and nods to Scooter that stands near the cracked door.

Outside on the grass, Scooter nods back to Teague with the silence signal: ready.

Each angel guard stand in front of the barn doors and watches every movement from an animal, the veil demon Priam, and red demon Preston inside the barn interior.

On top of the hay floor, angel Primus stares at girl with the golden veil over her face who continue to squeezes the cow udder with dripping raw milk as it hit the pail with a tiny ting.

Teague watches the red demon, who continues to trot back and forth from the hay loft, pitching hay strands on top of the veil girl's head.

Teague switches the sword into his left hand and stands in the en guard position with the sharp tip toward the heavens. His right hand is free to grab Primus from any harm coming from Preston.

Teague swings to see Scooter, Veck, and Bandy and double checks their secure and safe position as the angel unit sweeps a raised sword upright, readying for impeding battle with fresh demon blood and flesh.

Primus slowly moves ahead to the veiled girl.

The veiled girl continues to sit and sings out loud with a giggle, after the demon figure drops down a strand of loose hay onto her clothes. She continues to pick off each item allowing the hay grain to cover the hay floor.

Primus mentally remembered the fun event inside her demon mind on this particular evening, after their shard supper meal, when the distance neighbors walked down the road from five miles and visited the estate manor housing their shared Demon Den.

Her demon friends consisting of Morton, Radium, Colee, Blaze, and Barbie were inside the manor while chatting and eating a plate of sweet dessert, when the baby from the visiting family needed a cup of milk.

Preston had volunteered to fetch a pail of cow's milk inside the barn. As usual, Priam tagged along as Preston did not go anywhere, without her, except at six pm, when each angel and demon had separated for the evening as set by Curfew.

The concept of Curfew had forced angels and demons into a separate living compartment which had been enforced by angel Caiden keeping each naughty demon in line as a flock of good boys and girls here on Planet Earth.

Inside the barn, on top of the hay floor, angel Primus slowly strolls toward the veiled girl but feels angry and hate towards the red demon that plays before her two angel eyeballs in living color.

The tender scene in here during the year 1706 was a fun and carefree love event between two beings. Priam had loved Preston as he had been a kind and gentle boyfriend, who had always protected and sheltered her from the other demons, each stinky human, and every unknown angel.

On the hay floor, Primus stops and stands beside the veiled girl, slowly reaching out, extending her index finger towards the exposed collar bone on the veiled girl. She taps the collar bone and lifts up her hand with a smile.

On top of the foot stool, the veiled girl suddenly stops her movement as each one of her hands freezes underneath the cow's udder in time. Then she silently disappears from the small stool without smoke or fire or water or ash. She is gone from the angel eyeballs within Primus's eye sight.

Angel Primus feels mental, physical, spiritual, and emotional okay staring down at the empty stool inside the barn interior.

The red demon halts his body movement in mid-stride towards the hay bend and instinctively twists his body, seeing demon Priam as her both of her hands froze motionless underneath the cow's utter like a dead person. When she silently and completely disappears from the stool, the red demon screams out loud in a high pitched ear-piercing tone of panic, alarm, fright and angry.

On the entrance wall, angel Teague gasps in horror.

The red demon instantly morphs into a familiar creature with a head of blonde colored hair that slightly touching his shoulders, a rectangle face with a strong squared-jaw, a pair of emerald green eyeballs, a tone of olive tinted skin. He stands six feet and six inches in height and as he breathes in air with flesh and blood. Preston spins around from the empty foot stool and stares at the faithful angel, silently mouthing: Teague!

Then the colorful body of Preston beautifully explodes into an array of tiny red fragments disintegrating within the air waves, before each sizzling ash hits down on top of the hay floor as the cow loud moos.

"Preston!" Primus screams out loud in fright and sadness.

Teague reaches out and yanks Primus from the cow and back into his chest, holding his sword in front of her for an unexpected vicious attack from Preston. He rapidly back pedals towards the cracked barn door and exits the barn, moving backwards into his personal angel guards of Scooter, Veck, and Bandy.

Scooter, Veck, and Bandy, each one swiftly back pedal away from Teague and whip their sword through the empty air waves, staring at the barn door with confusion and puzzlement and some fear.

Teague cuddles Primus and watches the barn door and each animal for any violent sign of movement or attack from a hidden demon.

Primus watches the barn door and sobs with her wet tears, holding onto Teague, screaming out loud. "What happened in there? What's going on out here? I don't understand any of this, Teague."

Teague continues to back step from the open barn door and smiles at his first angel victory from his first demon defeat, hugging Primus, leaning down. He pecks her wet cheekbone, without the after effect of an ice cream headache, standing upright with loud laughter.

He whispers. "You have just performed the Un-learneth with a very bad demon memory, Prims."

"How many more of those do I do? It was very scary." Primus watches the barn doors and retreats with Teague moving further into the yard towards the flower garden.

Teague paces backwards and halts inside the clearing near the drop zone while slicing eye balls side to side, surveying the quiet grounds.

Clear!

He stops beside his buddy Scooter and nods with a smile. Scooter nods back to Teague with a grin.

Teague leans down into her eardrum. "I don't know, either, Prims. So we will take this thing slow and easy. Is that okay with you?"

Veck, Scooter, and Bandy race ahead and form a loose a circle with Teague and Primus.

In the western skyline, a sinking sun drops down into the earth plane signaling Curfew within the same space and time continuum.

"Okay." Primus whispers and watches the barn door. She has experienced her first Un-learneth concept with her first past demon memory inside the barn.

Now, Preston is gone and doesn't exist anymore along with demon Priam. They both have disappeared completely from her angle eyeballs and her demon mental mind.

"Do you see that? This was an easy thing, Prims." Scooter reaches over and pats Primus on her naked forearm.

Primus continues to view the barn doors and cuddles into Teague's chest.

"Everyone, sit down in a cross-legged pose, like before." Bandy sits down beside Veck on top of the grass and closes her eyeballs while readying to leave this place.

Teague feels the jumbled emotions inside Primus and releases her, assisting Primus to sit down in the grass. He sits down beside her in a cross-legged pose and inflates his wings with a smile while readying for next trip into the Accipio concept. He leans over and kisses her red swollen lips, pulling back with a smile, whispering into her wet cheekbone. "Think of another demon event, Prims."

Primus closes her eyelids and continues to sit in a cross-legged pose with her pair of inflated wings as the next demon memory invades her mind, softly whispering. "The year is 908 BC."

The circle of angels disappears completely from dairy farm and enter into demon memory.

Teague, Veck, Scooter, and Bandy nosily emerge through the open archway, feeling tired and drained, panting with a set of heavy breathes. Each one is covered with black dirt over an angel white uniform. Scooter detours to the food table and then stops, reaching out, lifting up a sweaty cold pitcher of ice cold water. He holds the pitch over his hair roots and flips the water, completely flooding his ponytail, his dirty neck, his back spine and his chest, washing off the dirt, soil, and itchy bugs from his aching and sleepy body.

Veck halts and laughs at Scooter. Bandy and Teague halt and laugh at Scooter's funny behavior also.

Veck strolls to the food table and collects a plate of food. He feels hungry, tired, and dirty in the same black dirt as Scooter from the last demon memory with Primus.

Primus is located inside her bedroom on the fifth level within the Tower Building, after Teague had escorted her from tiny room. She had been dirty with bugs and exhausted with her angel duty, and upset from each successfully demon memory wipes.

Inside the room, Teague moves to the center floor and sits down on top of the hard rock, exhaling with worry for primus and exhaustion from each trip through space and time.

Bandy sits down beside Teague and leans her head onto his collar bone, exhaling with sour breath and exhaustion also.

Jazmine and Caiden appear and tote an oversized plate of food and a tall cold beverage for Teague and Bandy, before starting the series of important questions about the Accipio trip. Each one scoots back and sits down in front of the four young angels.

Scooter feels wet and happy wearing a big grin and a soiled vest, strolling besides Veck, sitting down on the floor. He plows both hands down into the oversized plate of food, chewing with an open mouth.

Jazmine nods with a stern face to Teague. "Ya'll have been gone here from Angel Haven for three days and three..."

"Where's Primus?" Caiden scans the room and worries for his daughter.

"Primus is sound asleep inside her chamber. this Accipio process is hardest on her." Teague talks and eats between the bites of good food.

Jazmine nods. "You have been gone for three days and nights. Does this mean that you have completed the Accipio process?"

Teague waves his free hand and chews the food, shaking his curls with a silent negative answer.

Caiden frowns. "Is Primus alright? I've been worried about each one of you. You didn't communicate with me back here on any angel level."

"She's fine." Teague swallows the food and nods with a smile. "Primus is fine." He sips the beverage and burps out loud with a grin. "We can't talk to you during the Accipio cycle."

"And we are fine and dandy, just hungry and tired." Veck shoves the food into his open mouth and swallows the lump without chewing.

Jazmine frowns. "Why have each one of you been gone for three days and nights, Teague? What were you doing during these three distinct and different space and time continuums, Veck or Scooter or Bandy?"

Bandy swallows her food and then sips her beverage, nodding with a smile to Jazmine. "Primus has a unique ability and mental endurance to remember one demon memory after another. We've been destroying each one of her demon memories on a minute by minute basis, since we had vanished from this room, three days and nights ago.

Jazmine smiles, "You have not been destroying, but losing each one of these nasty demon memories within Primus. There is a big difference here, Bandy."

Bandy nods in silence and continues to eat.

She nods, "How is the Accipio concept performing, Teague?"

Teague nods, "Very good."

Jazmine requires each major and minor detail to complete her analysis for the on-going process of eliminating each one of the demon memories within Primus. She smirks at Teague. "How many demon memories have been lost by Primus?"

"Way too many!" Scooter nosily slurps his beverage.

"What's the count, so far, Bandy?" Veck eats the food.

"I last counted the math number of 366 lost demon memories from Primus." Bandy sips her cool beverage.

Caiden turns and frowns at Jazmine, "How much farther for Primus, until the end of her demon memories?"

Scooter frowns. "I don't know."

Bandy nods, "Me, either."

Veck frowns. "I'm too tired to think about my own angel memories."

Teague informs between each bite of food. "Primus looks really exhausted like each one of us. She wears a set of black bags underneath each one of her eye sockets and a pair of red blood shot eyeballs."

Jazmine nods. "I will go and examine Primus for any mental incongruities, Caiden. Don't worry! This is part of the Accipio concept." Caiden nods in silence. Jazmine scrabbles down all the new information with a feathered pen on her notepad. "Teague, tell me everything from start to finish. I need to gather more information for Primus to finish eliminating the rest of her nasty demon memories."

Teague frowns. "She fainted at the last demon memory and that brought us back here inside that little room here inside this squat building."

Caiden gasps in worry and starts to stand.

Jazmine reaches over and touches his collar bone, shaking her curls, "Stay calm, Caiden. Yes, I had expected Primus to become exhausted after her performance from each Un-learneth concept. This is normal." She looks down and writes down medical notes inside the notepad.

Caiden exhales with worry and a frown, "Normal! None of this is normal, Jazmine."

"Right now, Primus must rest from each one of her Un-learneth performances today. That's all. Then she can hit the trail tomorrow morning," Jazmine softly chuckles and continues to scribble down more information on the pad and then looks up see Bandy. "Back up here! You had counted the math number of 366 demon memories which had been lost within the last three days and nights from five am until this morning. The current time is early morning of her fourth day within the Accipio concept."

Bandy nods in silence and then eats the food.

"Yeah, we flew between numerous centuries after each demon memory zap, starting in the year 1706 moving to the 908 BC and to the year 1908 AD." Scooter eats with a nod. "So, we want around the world block several times, before coming back home..."

"...to roost..." Veck spits out the chewed food particles over the clean floor.

"...and rest..." Bandy swallows the food and then yawns from exhaustion.

Jazmine nods. "The lost demon memories number 366 which are divided by the math number of three which equals 122 terminated demon memories, each day.

Scooter frowns. "That is a perfect number of lost demon memories. Whoa!"

"Does the math number 122 represent something special, Jazmine?" Caiden turns and frowns at the nose profile on Jazmine.

"The math number 122 divided by 50 million years is a little tea tiny percentage with six leading zeros, before the decimal period, if she had that many nasty demon memories to bust." Scooter nods and then eats the food.

Jazmine shakes her red tinted buzz cut. "The 50 million years of nasty demon memories within Primus is irrelevant here. The math number 122 is more important to me. That math number represents the percentage of significant encounters or significant occasions that she had shared with demon Preston within her mental mind." Teague sneers with the new information and demon reality between his food bites.

"I don't understand your logic and the Accipio logic with the number of memories, Jazmine." Caiden frowns. "If you are wrong, then my daughter will be spending another 50 million years as an angel while trying to fix her mental mind from the past 50 million years where she had slaved as a demon female underneath demon Preston's rule of thumb." Teague continue to sneer at the new information in-between bites of food.

Jazmine shakes her buzz cut with a frown. "No, that is not correct, Caiden. The math number 122 is the most important from her nasty demon memories within her data bank of mental mind memories. Think of it like a virtual picture! When we hold the Festival of Flight which is once every twenty angel years, the event is the most point within an angel's current memory banks during that calendar year. While the rest of the calendar days, months, and years in-between that most important angel event just occupies an angel's normal regular routine rituals of sleep, eat, fly..."

"Pee..." Veck laughs.

"Kill..." Teague sneers at the new information in-between each bite of food.

"Thanks for one of the most popular angel routines, Veck, and the less popular angel routines, Teague." Jazmine sneers at each young angel.

"You're welcome, Jazmine." Veck smiles with chewed food particles over his teeth.

Teague wipes his mouth with back of his hand and frowns. "So, there must be another 122 math number or less. Is that what you're speculating here, to us, Jazmine?"

Jazmine nods. "Correct, Teague. I'm guessing there are less than another 122 events left inside her mental mind regarding the rest of her deeply embedded nasty demon memories. The group of hiding demons did not go outside away from the Demon Den for a fun social occasion during the evening's social hour, since they must spend half their life inside a darkened building doing a series of boring routine work. You told me that the first demon memory had landed your booted feet in the year 1706. Where did you land? What happened in there?"

Scooter nods. "We landed in the year 1706 at a country dairy farm in the rural town of Duns within the country of Scotland. Primus as demon Priam was a simple farm girl that was squeezing milk from a tit of a dairy cow and not a princess or a duchess or any important person role within the manor or on the farm. So, I guess that sorta blows your special demon event theory, Jazmine. Huh!" He softly chuckles at arrogant and ancient Jazmine.

She was a simple farm girl." Caiden gasps in alarm. "That means. That means. That means Primus could possess thousands, millions, trillions, or zillions of every day demon mental mind memories that must be lost from her young mind. This...this...will take another life time to lose all of these zillions of nasty demon memories within Primus. I want my daughter back right now, Jasmine."

"How many mental mind memories does an entity hold?" Bandy frowns.

"A life time of memories..." Veck nods.

"She could hold millions or trillions or zillions." Teague gasps in alarm with the new information also. "Then, we need to awaken primus and get moving this morning, before the sunrise. I agree with Caiden." He drops down his dirty plate without food items and with food stains on the floor, staring to stand with a worried brow.

Jazmine laughs out loud and waves her hand in the air. "Don't worry, ya'll! I have another method that can be applied, if need be."

"Well then, let's same time and apply that second method directly on Primus, right now, Jazmine." Bandy nods with a smile.

Teague sits back down on her hard floor and frowns at Jazmine. "What other second method, Jazmine? You have not mentioned a second method with the removal of her string of nasty demon memories from Primus. What is it? Tell me right now!"

She flips a hand with a smirk. "Now is not the place or time to discuss a second method, Teague. Based on all the new information from your last three days and nights from the Accipio concept, I have concluded here. Primus could have arrived from another Demon Den, after her demon trip which had made that demon memory very special within her mind. Or she could have greeted some very special visitors inside her shared house turning that demon event into a special demon memory. There are a number of reasons without relying upon any additional interrogation from the demon Priam character that had appeared on a dairy cow farm in the year 1706." Jazmine nods.

Caiden nods. "And we will not ask my daughter about any of her stored demon memories either. She doesn't need to be reminded of what she was doing with the band of demons during her missed 50 million years."

"Or what was she smelling with the band of demons? My nose holes really appreciate her Accipio sacrifice too." Scooter smiles with a sight of his wet and chewed food particles between each tooth as Veck and Bandy chuckle with amusement.

"My point, Primus is about half-way home back to us as an innocent angel. You are doing good work here. So, I'm guessing here that there is probably another three working days left, before she loses all of her nasty demon memories." Jazmine nods.

"Hurrah!" Bandy cheers.

"Fine by me!" Veck exhales.

"The days and nights of hard work has completed for us. I'm retiring for the early morning to my bed chamber and sleeping," Teague slowly stands upright from the hard surface and carefully stretches each arm towards the heavens, dropping the arms down his waistline, cracking each knuckles, tilting his numb neck muscles side to side. From his forearm, his open skin wound spatters down a splash of tiny red colored droplets of blood proteins on his dirty but white colored clothes and in the air waves.

Jazmine's pair of acute eyeballs catches the slow motion of each tiny blood protein and follows it down to the floor, standing upright from the floor, looking up with a gasp to see Teague. She reaches out and points at the bloody arm wound on Teague with worry. "Why are you bleeding from an open skin wound, Teague?"

Teague jerks off part of his torn tee shirt with a grunt and mops up the fresh blood proteins on his arm. "O! I'm sorry about the gross bloody sight. I fought with Preston."

Jazmine gasps in alarm. "You had battled with demon Preston. How is that possible within the Accipio concept while you stand as an eyewitness only inside one of her nasty demon memories, Teague?"

Teague continue to mop of the wet blood and wraps the torn fabric around his arm wound, looking up with a wink at Jazmine. "We and he were all standing within the US State of Texas on another cow farm, before the battle between tough guys," he laughs with the other angels.

Scooter smiles. "We and he were all located on top of the Old Road survey plot in year 1840 with that twenty-three years old..."

"Twenty-three million years of age, demon Preston is twenty-three million years old, Scooter," Veck nods.

Teague laughs with a nod. "William Preston, he was the commander in charge of the batch of Texas soldiers..."

"Legion of Texas soldiers..." Veck laughs.

Caiden frowns. "Did ya'll fight with swords or guns, Teague?"

Scooter laughs. "Both!"

Bandy nods. "William Preston and his legion of soldiers were stationed at the Texan US military base at Fort Preston near the rural town of Preston within the US State of Texas."

Scooter smiles, "Narcissistic, isn't the red demon?"

Veck nods. "Narcissistic leadership is a common trait for..."

Teague nods. "Naw, he ain't no leader, here nor there. Demon Preston possesses a personality disorder which is called NPD or narcissistic personality disorder. The red demon is excessively pre-occupied and fascinated with one's self, excessive self-love, vanity, erotic gratification of his admiration of one's own physical selfie."

"That's right, hoss!" Scooter laughs.

Veck smiles, "Almost everyone has some type of narcissistic traits including conceitedness, argumentativeness or selfishness."

Scooter smiles, "Angels don't."

Veck nods. "Do."

Scooter frowns. "Don't."

Jazmine frowns. "Do you boys mind shutting up here? I wanna here the tale from Teague."

Scooter whispers. "O! I'm sorry, Jazmine."

Teague nods. "The legion of soldiers was building a passable dirt road from the country village of Preston, Texas to the small town of Austin, Texas."

Scooter nods. "During the eventually demon memory within Primus, demon leader Preston was presented to us in a red format that echoes his true demon form with an inflated pair of twenty-three feet in red tinted demon wings."

Caiden shakes his skull. "Red hue always appears in demon form among our angel's eyeballs. This is simply unbelievable! I wished I was there to see all of that too."

Teague frowns. "No, you don't wanna be there, Caiden."

Veck nods. "Yep! I don't wanna be there, Caiden."

"Right so, hoss!" Scooter nods.

Teague nods. "When Primus touches her old demon self..."

"Yes. Yes. Yes." Jazmine claps with joy. "Her touch works. I know it would work during the Accipio concept."

Teague exhales with annoyance. "Then, the female disguised with the golden veil is named Priam and then she will disappear, without any explosion or light..."

"Or water..." Scooter nods.

"Or fishes...." Veck laughs.

"Or snakes..." Bandy frowns.

Scooter nods. "Only Preston..."

"... as the red demon, who viciously overreacts with his violent fury. He pops out from his red tinted shell form and appears in live and breathing form as the real demon Preston what I can only describe as a human moment for me," Teague nods.

Scooter nods. "A demon person appears in six feet and six inches of height with a head of blonde colored hair, a tone of olive colored skin, a pair of blue eyes..."

Veck smiles. "Actually, a pair of demon eyeballs is really blood shot red and lined with girly black colored..."

"Forget him!" Scooter frowns. "Don't over dramatize the demon inside the demon event, Veck."

Teague nods. "After demon Priam disappears from her memory and demon Preston materializes, real demon Preston always reaches out and tries to grab angel Primus."

Jazmine gasps. "Unbelievable!"

Teague slaps his chest. "But I'm always faster. I get her out of his way before ..."

"Preston uses his demon sword on my daughter," Caiden gasps in alarm and worries for her safety inside the upcoming Accipio events,

Jazmine frowns. "What sword, Teague?"

Scooter chuckles. "In the year 1804, each one of them there Texas cowboys carried a big long steel blade and I don't mean cut from Johnson grass either."

Teague nods. "Demon Preston pulled out his blade from the sheath and attacked me. I attacked back, of course. Preston attacked second. Then I got sliced at his body. But he bleeds..."

"You bleed better, hoss!" Scooter laughs.

Veck nods. "Each fighting supernatural entity really produced red tinted blood proteins."

Bandy nods. "The entire demon memory also stank too."

Jazmine asks. "Stunk! What do your angel nostrils smell with Accipio event, Bandy?"

Teague nods, "Tar and..."

"...cow patties," Scooter finishes with a smile.

Veck nods. "Demon Preston was a real person along with the red blood, the long sword and the cow patties."

Jazmine shakes her buzz cut. "Unbelievable!"

Bandy frowns. "What is unbelievable here? What is wrong with the Accipio concept, Jasmine?"

Jazmine nods. "I had never imaged that the Accipio concept could be so surreal and interactive during a past memory moment. What do you think, Caiden?"

Caiden exhales with worry and nods to Jazmine. "I think the Accipio concept should be stopped immediately. Primus is my daughter. I can live with her demon memoires intact. She can live with her..."

"Forget you, Caiden!" Jazmine turns and nods to Teague. "You have established yourself as her guide within each Accipio event during any one of her nasty demon memories. Therefore, you must continue to be her guide, Teague."

Scooter frowns. "So, what is happening to real demon leader Preston, Jazmine?"

Jazmine smiles. "Preston's connection to angle Primus is very stronger, a lot stronger than I had realized. Teague, you must protect angel Primus during each one of her Un-learneth events. If real demon leader Preston does..."

"Don't worry about that!" He pulls out and twirls his sword around his sneer. "Demon Preston ain't touching my angel girl Prims ever, never, foreverly," he slams the top of his sword down with a loud ting and slices off a chip of the pink tinted hard rock from the floor as the small chips fly through the air and land in different directions.

Jazmine nods with a worried brow. "I am more worried about demon leader Preston touching your angel body part, Teague. Preston can't influence Primus with his presence or his words. However, your presence..."

Bandy asks. "What about his demon mental thoughts inside her angel mind?"

Jazmine lectures. "Primus has her own set of angel thoughts. Preston is a re-action from your presence there inside her demon memory with demon Priam and angel Primus, Teague. You are my first concern. He is my first worry."

Teague gasps. "Will Preston every harm my angel Prims?"

Jazmine frowns. "No! He might retrieve or acquire..."

Bandy gasps. "You mean Preston can re-capture her back her demon memories..."

"Preston will capture back her heart, Teague. Preston is a very important person within Primus's old demon life, at the moment..."

"At the moment!" Teague exhales with worry. "The moment is gone forever for Preston." Teague and the other angel chuckle at Preston's upcoming permanent demise from Planet Earth.

Each one of the angels and every single demon are stuck here on the planet until the second coming event has arrived and been completed. Then the War of the Apocalypse will occur and last a few days. Then the old planet will be destroyed and every good soul will live on a new planet within a new universe. The happy ending.

Inside the large room, Jazmine nods to Teague. "Until Primus has completed each one of her Un-learneth concepts with every one of her nasty demon memories and all of her associated demon feelings, she is extremely vulnerable to demon Preston."

Teague nods. "Understood."

Jazmine exhales with concern. "With all of that said here and now, the rest of her nasty demon memories are going to be exhausting within her mind and body."

Teague nods. "Tomorrow, we start..."

Caiden shakes his gray haired skull. "No! There will no tomorrow. No! I am not allowing it. Tomorrow is our angel festival day. This is the day for my Primus to enjoy her life as an angel and have some fun at the fun angel event and create a new angel memory, before her demon work duty starts again."

Jazmine shakes her buzz cut and wears a worried brow. "Caiden, I strongly advise..."

"Hush, Jazmine!" Caiden nods with a smile. "My daughter needs to have some fun and games at our weekly angel festival." He turns and nods to each young angel. "Every angel, go home and go to bed, right now! Tomorrow, we all celebrate the Festival of Flight. Good night to all and to all a good sleep!" He spins around and shakes his head with worry.

The rest of the angels slowly spin around and yawn from exhaustion, strolling to their individual sleeping unit within Angel haven.

Each standing or sitting angel huddles, not too closely and exhibits set of inflated angel wings. A set of faint voices chats way too loudly as each word drifts within the cold air temperatures. Each pair of angel wings swish very nosily through the air during each race activity here within the Festival of Flight event on top of the Sandia Mountain Range.

In the pale blue sky, angel Primus flies with a grin through the air waves coming from the other mounting range, extending both of her arms, wiggling one set of her finger pads at her flying buddy Teague.

Teague soars several feet in-between his angel girl Primus and his best buddy Scooter in a semi-crooked row with his other angel friends consisting of Brandy and Veck towards the angel event on another mountain peak.

Teague dives down first and lands on top of the naked rock and looks up, waving both arms in the air while motioning Primus down to the ground. Scooter, Bandy and Veck dive down and gently land beside Teague.

In the skyline, Primus dives down with a laugh from the fun flying activity and does not land but flies around the cold air currents within the bright sunlight enjoying her first day of freedom as an angel. She had been so depressed and sad for the past three days and nights here at the hidden village of Angel Haven, before, during, and after the Accipio event, where she has performed the Un-learneth concept that came from ancient and arrogant Jazmine.

She laughs out loud and halts in the sky, standing upright within the air currents with a smile, slowly dropping through the air, landing down beside Teague. She leans over and gently kisses his lips.

Teague quickly yanks back from her soft lips with a loud cough and then a soft sneeze, wiping off the wet mucus from his fake smile while still sniffing her demon odor. "Deflate your wings, Prims!"

She looks up and smiles at the sun. "Why? The sunrays heat my wings and my body in the cold air here on the new mountain peak."

He gasps with worry as his nostril still smell the demon odor through the sunlight and the light breeze. "Ugh! The high mountain winds will chill your wings like a tray of cold ice cubes and then you might become sick like me." Teague coughs from her demon odor and nods at her. She deflates her wings with a nod in silence. He quickly un-wraps the girly shawl from his fit waistline and leans over, dropping the shawl over her upper body, nodding with a smile.

Primus wears a white tinted shawl over her upper body that locks her wings underneath her back spine.

Teague turns and faces the entrance point that leads into the Festival of flight wearing his inflated wings, extending out his arm. She turns and extends her arm toward the tip of his wing without touching his hand.

Teague wiggles his finger pads and strikes only air pockets without touching her finger pads from the mathematically spaced distance within the tip of his wing span that stands away from Primus.

They slowly stroll side by side and head into the Festival events for all the daylight and nighttime activities.

Teague still faintly smells her stinky demon odor sniffing up a faint scent of cooked tar and cow patties coming from her angel body. Primus continues to lose each demon memory which is attached within her angel mind from the past 50 million years at every single Demon Den and her demon life with demon leader Preston. Therefore, her demon odor still lingers around her angel body along with the remaining demon memories until tomorrow morning at midnight.

However, in one or two days, Primus will finish purging out the rest of her demon memories from her mind and her soul. Then Teague and Primus will be together forever.

On top of the pink soil, moving closer to the festival entrance point, Teague points to each physical site and discusses the boring details here on Angel Haven. "The massive mountain range encompasses four different zones of earth nature. The black and blue grama grasslands geologically couple with the barrier Potassium-feldspar or the K-spar red crystals which form a beautifully embedded rock formation that displays the distinctive pink color along the western range. The mountain range rises in elevation upwards to 7,200 feet among in the baby blue skies. The highest mountain peak top is over 30,000 feet high and provides a row of nice and secure angel homes inside our tiny but hidden angel village."

"Wait!" She stops and stares at the mountain range, spinning around, pointing back at the other mountain peak. "We fly across the air winds and came from the Cristo Mountains, where Angel Haven is hidden and located. What is the new place? Why is this another angel village?"

Scooter stops and smiles at the beautiful mountain range, inhaling the fresh air, exhaling with joy. "We are angels, Primus. We own all of this and enjoy all of this. We live here and there all the time."

Veck stops and smiles at the beauty of the Maker, "This is actually a training village, which is also our secretly unknown spot from our enemies. The Festival of Flight is a fun angel event but it is also an informal military training session which is observed by Caiden and the other ancient angels. We must be prepared for war with the demons at any time with any one and anywhere also."

Primus frowns. "I see."

Teague clears a dry throat and moves ahead towards the entrance point, jabbing a finger at each natural site with a smile. The rest of the angels follow behind him. He continues to narrate. "And the eastern landscape goes up to 10, 678 feet as the spruce and fir trees play a nice game of Tag together, while the northern side paints colors of evergreen trees against the cold-tolerant dark brown oak trees that peak up at 7,800 feet in height and towards the heavens. The southern side on the mountain range produces pods of flowers with colorful plants in red and yellow and orange desert marigolds along with various puke green fruit bearing pear trees in-between the white limestone and pink sandstone rock boulders as the west side of the range steeps with rugged sheer gray rock walls towering between two pointy summits as the east mountain side slopes down to Earth.

"The pink tinted deviled-horned represent a North-South ridge that rises up into two major summits. The north peak is called the Sandia Crest and the southern tip is known as the Sandia Peak carrying both peak tops to an elevation height of 30,000 feet that almost leaps up into the nightly stars and disguises the secret angel hideout.

"Our angel village is parked deeply between the twin summits, which is called the Tijeras Canyon. The Tijeras Canyon is a deep and dark and dense set of sheer walls in gray limestone rock producing a mountain bio-herm or an ancient barrier reef of solid rock wall, not soft ocean water."

Scooter takes the lead from the leader and enters the natural rock opening, spreading his arms at the new landscape. "Presenting to you and me, the Sandia Mountains!" He struts ahead and enjoys the new sights and sounds of the angel festival.

The flat solid ground of pink rock soil sits in-between two tall mountain sides of gray rock that extends for miles using a pair of angel eyeballs. A few feet from the tall naturally looking rock gates, each side wall contains a semi-crooked row of natural gray tinted rock coated table-like surfaces that hold an assortment of fresh food and beverage items.

Numerous angels with a pair of inflated wings slowly stroll through the entrance point with their friends or family members, veering towards one side wall with the food table or moving further down the soil towards a spot with pods of curved rock furniture pieces that gently formed an individual rock coated eating table with a set of matching sitting chairs.

Each angel sits down or either strolls ahead enjoying the current activities within the Festival of Flight.

After entering through the twin gates of tall slender rock triangle-shaped gates, Scooter turns and veers towards one of the side walls and collects a plate of food while eating some of the items while scooting down the food table. His fellow angels behind Scooter and collect a plate of food, exiting the table, moving deeply into the eating area, picking out an empty rock-coated table with six matching rock-coated chair.

He sits and down, viewing the current flying activity, eating with his hands that accuracy find his open mouth. He chews the food and watches the flight event.

Bandy sits down beside Scooter and places her food on top of the shared rock table, smiling at the tall mountain walls. "The word Sandia means..."

"...watermelon..." Primus laughs and slides down into an empty rock chair, leaving two empty chairs for Veck and Teague.

"Where's the whole red tinted juicy watermelon fruit? I didn't see it. So, I must have missed the fruit." Veck stops before the empty chair and spins around, scanning each food table for the item.

"Wrong, Veck!" Scooter laughs and spit out his chewed food particles over his plate of food and the clean rock table, "Right, Prims."

Bandy massages her food with her hands, before eating, staring at the solid wall. "The pink tinted rocks reflect off each blistering sun rays during the heated sunset which come from the Spanish noun that means, Watermelon Mountains in the English language," she lifts her hand and sucks on each finger of food.

Scooter spits out more chewed food particle through the air, over his plate, and on top of the clean rock coated table. "Actually, the human's academic textbook references a reddish color tone among each one of the mountain walls during the heated sunset like my angel hair." He reaches up with a food-coated hand and yanks on his red colored ponytail, mouthing in silence with his pretend pain.

Each angel laughs out loud but Primus. She looks up with a smile and stares at Scooter's food coated red colored ponytail, gagging out loud without vomiting up her breakfast meal. She pulls her plate away from her chest and looks up, staring at the current race of flight.

"I like Bandy's description much better, Scooter." Veck lifts his hand of mashed up food items and nosily sucks on each finger of food like the other angels.

Bandy chews and then swallows the food, diving her hand back down into the plate, mixing the food items with a smile. "The ancestral and early nomad people from the tiny village of Pueblo consider this mountain to be a scared place."

"No visitors are allowed." Veck laughs and spits out chewed food particles in the air, over his plate and on the dirty rock table.

"The Sandia Mountain Range is seventeen miles long and eight miles wide for a human but short for an angel," Bandy lifts her hand and sucks on her middle finger with food.

Teague stirs his food with one hand in the same plate and lifts up a food-covered hand, sucking on his index finger, chewing the food. He spits out chewed food particles in the air, over his plate, and on top of the rock table. "The Festival of Flight shows off each set of flying skills plus any daring set of wing aerobatics coming from a talented or a lazy angel. You will see from each angel rolls, dives, glides, turns, takeoffs, landings, climbs, passes..."

"... spats and stalls and falls..." Scooter spits out his chewed foot particles over the space and the place with laughter.

"No way!" Bandy spits out her chewed food particles over the place and the space with laughter.

"Yes way! If Scooter starts to compete with his lousy flying skills," Veck spits out his chewed food particles over the space and the place with laughter.

"There is pylon racing also. Do you see the two natural rock formation that appears like a tall tower down at the southern end of the flat plateau?" Teague points a food-coated finger in the air at the two tall structures in the far distance using his angel eyeballs that peer through the coverage of white clouds within the baby blue sky.

"Red Baron always wins." Scooter looks down and mixes his food with both hands.

Primus narrows her eyelashes and follows each flying angel without viewing a set of terrible table manner from each one of her angel friends, "Red Baron, which angel is that one?"

"Him!" Scooter points a food-coated finger in the air as his meshed food particles fly through the air and land down on the plate. "Red Baron is his nickname and displays a petite body frame with a pair of compact white tinted wings that holds alternating light brown and beige colored fluffy feathers."

Teague continues to suck on each food-coated finger in-between each one of his vocal words. "His nickname settles the deicidtor from the quickest flying race, the quickest." He spits out his chewed particles of food items that fly through space and place with his laughter.

"Deicidtor is not a word, Teague." Scooter is the intellect among the angel quartet and continues to mix his food with both of his dirty hands.

"Yeah, it is. You just used it correctly in your sentence structure, to boot. Deicidtor or decider ends the flight race. The deicidtor is always the Red Baron." Teague spits out his chewed food particles flying over space and place with his laughter.

Primus continues to wiggle inside the chair at the rock eating table without consuming her plate of food holding back down the bitter bile from creeping up her dry throat. She exhales with annoyance at the four messy angels and lifts up her hand, exposing her upper body underneath the girly shawl. She points at the platform with a smile. "One of the platform is empty, why is that?"

At the table, Teague coughs out loud and then sneezes several times in a row, wiping his mouth with the back of his clean hand, reaching out and touches her hand with his food-covered fingers. Primus quickly retracts her clean hand with a gasp from his wiggling nasty food-covered fingers, swiftly standing upright from the chair, dancing sideways from the table with a fake smile. She drops her hand and covers it back underneath her shawl, standing away from the rude party of angels and their matching table manners.

At the table, Scooter sneezes out loud and wipes the wet mucus from his nostrils with a food-coated finger, turning to smile at the empty platform. "That empty platform is used for the long distance racing which started this morning at first light at four am and will last the entire day, until twelve midnight tomorrow morning."

"Wow! Do they get tired of flying and performing all of these great feats during the festival?" Primus continues to stand away from the table of angels and frowns at each tall platform in the far distance with an assortment of flying angels during the races.

"Usually, only one deicidtor usually wins it all and his nickname is the Lone Star." Scooter uses Teague's funny word and spits out his chewed food particles through the air within the same space and place with his laughter.

Bandy spits out her chewed particles through the air with her laughter. "As a lazy angel is too afraid to compete..."

"... like Scooter." Veck spits out his chewed food particles through the air with laughter.

"... with Scooter." Teague spits out his chewed food particles through the air with laughter.

"No way!" Scooter frowns with his food-stained lips.

"Yes way!" Veck nods with a food-stained mouth.

Bandy lifts up a food-coated finger and flings the food item in the air through space and place, pointing at the next platform. "There is presented a series of aerial short competition consisting of hovering, gliding, speeding, looping, and..."

"A praying..." Scooter spits out his chewed food particles in the air with laughter.

"Who is the bester hover angel, ya'll?" Bandy smiles with a food-covered mouth at the active flying races.

"Black Hawk always wins that event." Veck chews and swallows the food, lowering a dirty hand back down into the tall pile of food, mixing the food items together.

"Who performs the highest flight up into the heavens?" Bandy sucks on her ring finger of food and swallows the soft food items down her throat.

"Dare Devil, he always wins." Veck sucks on his index finger of food and quickly swallows the meshed food down his throat.

"Who wins the vortex spin?" Bandy sucks on her middle finger of food and swallows the mixed food down her throat.

Teague spits out his chewed food particles through the air smiling at each race. "A vortex spins occurs when both body and wings are tucked inside your shoulders as you spin down to the ground, defining air pressure, wind, and sky."

Scooter swallows the food and nods at each platform. "A vortex spins is a very, very scary and a very, very dangerous feat."

"Topper, she always wins the vortex spin event." Veck sucks on his pinky finger of food and then swallows the soft items down his throat.

"Now, who always wins the funny named contest? Every angel-kid must participate with their parents' permission." Scooter spits out his food particles through the air with his laughter.

"O! I know that answer. That silly angel is named Scooter." Veck spits out his chewed food particles through the air with his laughter.

Scooter turns and points his food-coated finger at his friend Vick as each meshed food items flies from the flesh and travels through the air, landing down on the table, "Hey now! I'm been punked..."

Primus continues to stand at a safe distance from the table of rude angels and then drops her face down into her chin, staring at the pink rock soil, gagging in sickness, without vomiting up her breakfast entree.

"It's punked, ya funny named supernatural creature." Veck spits out his chewed food particles through the air with his laughter.

Scooter lifts up his hand and touches each food-coated finger, flinging some of the mixed food into the air with his smile. "Robin, Sparrow, Eagle, Vulture..."

"Those are not a set of funny names, Scooter." Bandy drops her hand back down into her plate of food and stirs the items, before eating them, wearing a smile.

Scooter lifts both food-coated hands in the air and wiggles his fingers as an assortment of food particles fling from each finger, flying through the air, landing down on his hair roots, the table surface, and his plate of food. He laughs. "Not for you, but for them, it's a hoot, who, who, hoot. Get it! Got it! That's a listing of little birdie names. A birdie is found on the earthy..."

"Who gives a toot or a hoot, horsey?" Veck spits out his food items through the air with his laughter.

Bandy sucks on her index finger of food and then swallows the food, smiling at Veck. "Scooter means to ask. What is the funniest flying maneuver here at the Festival of Flight?"

Scooter lifts up his food-covered hand and points a food-covered finger at Bandy, flinging the hand, nodding with laughter. "That is a right question. Who is the fastest runner among the angels?"

Teague sucks on his middle finger and quickly swallows the food down his throat, laughing out loud. "A runner has a pair of legs, not a pair of wings, Scooter."

Scooter stands upright from the chair and waves both arms in the air as numerous piece of dried and wet food items soar into the sky. A gathering of numerous mountain birds hover several miles above the table, diving down with a pair of acute birdie's eyeballs, snatching up the flying food particles from the air. Scooter laughs. "Who is the bravest angel that runs in the direction and clears off the mountain peak down into a vortex spin before hitting the solid pink rock below?"

Veck drops his hand down and stirs the food on the same plate with a smile. "Dare Devil, he wins that brave event each time."

"Who displays the longest wingspan?" Scooter continues to stand and slowly twirls around for fun, flinging dried and wet food particles in the air as each bird swoops down and grabs their mid-day meal also.

Teague sucks on each finger with the soft mixed food particles, quickly consuming the meal, laughing out loud, "Who is the fastest angel flier?"

Bandy cleans off each food-covered finger and sucks down the soft contents, swallowing the lump, smiling with a nod. "Who is the most graceful angel flyer?"

"Who possesses the largest set of angel wings?" Veck spits out his chewed food particles through the air with his laughter.

Some of the brave birds sweep down and catch the tiny wet food particles, swallowing it whole, hovering above the table of messy angels.

Primus feels the wind shift and looks up with a gasp, seeing several mountain birds attack each air-borne food particle, smiling at the maneuver.

"Who possesses the biggest set of angel wings?" Scooter leans down and eats the rest of the food on top of the edible plant-made plate, chewing the food item.

"It's called the largest set of angel wings." Veck wipes the plate with his finger and then sucks down the warm food down his throat, starting to consume the plate next.

Scooter swallows the lump of food and nods to Veck. "Naw, there's a difference, hoss."

Veck swallows the lump of food and frowns at Scooter. "No, Scooter! There ain't." He starts to consume the empty glass that is made of edible plants next.

"No! It's not, Veck." Scooter lifts up the edible glass and rips the plant-made contents apart, tossing each item into the air, laughing with fun. Each bird takes a turn and dives down, capturing the edible food item, flying back up among the huddle and swallows its meal and waits for the next one.

"Yes, there is, Scooter." Veck continues sit and consumes the edible plant-made tumbler, swallowing the food item.

"No." Scooter yells out loud and swiftly spins around in several completed circles while flinging off each dried and wet food particle that has covered both of his hands, his messy face, and his hairy ponytail as each food particles flings off his body and flies into the air, hovering for a split second among the currents.

A huddle of birds loudly squawk their food piece and then dive down in a graceful form, capturing one of hovering food particles, flying back up in the same graceful form. Each one hovers in the air and watches for the next meal piece.

"Yes." Veck swiftly stands upright from the rock chair and yells out loud, chewing the last pieces of the plant-made tumbler, spinning around in several circles. Flying particles of wet and dry food leap off his body and hover in the air waves also.

The same air-borne row of hungry birds dives down in another graceful form and captures each floating food particles, flying back into the clouds, eating the meal.

Bandy slowly stands upright from her rock chair and rips apart her plant-made plant and tumbler into small pieces, tossing them out in the air, spinning around in several circles also. She giggles out loud and cleans off her dirty body and food-covered hands during the air currents as each wet and dried food particle flies from her body and hovers in the air.

The birds dive down and eat the new meal portion, flying back into formation.

At the table, Teague continues to sit and sucks on his last finger of soft food, slowly standing upright from the chair, eating the plate that comprises fried plants, swallowing the food. He spins around and smiles at Primus, without performing the circle maneuver, flinging both hands in the air as each wet and dried food particle leaps from his body.

The same row of patient mountain birds sweeps down and attacks each air-borne food particles, flying back in formation, waiting for the next meal.

Teague extends a hand to Primus with a smile. "Now, we all have finished eating our lunch meal. We all can travel ahead and watch the backwards flying race competition."

Primus slowly moves ahead and examines Teague's body, viewing a set of clean hands, clean face, and a pair of clean lips without on speckle of wet or dry food particles. She exhales with relief and stops inside his chest, cuddling his warm body with a smile.

Veck stops spinning with a smile and stands in front of the table, pressing both hands over his clean angle uniform, feeling the crisp fabric and his clean body. He scoots away from the table. Bandy appears fresh and clean in body, mind, and appearance also. They move together and hold hands with a smile.

Veck laughs. "A backwards flying maneuver is part of an angel's normal flying technique, Teague."

Scooter scoots from the table and races ahead of his friends, spinning around, slowly walking backwards with his eyelids shut. He laughs out loud. "Not with your eyes closed..."

Veck cuddles his girl Bandy and laughs at his angel brother. "Forget Scooter! He talks and walks forward with his eyes closed, which is a difficult feat, too."

"Naw, I don't." Scooter continues to walk backwards with both arms in front of his chest and a pair of closed eyelids, laughing for fun.

Primus cuddles with Teague and follows slightly behind Bandy and Veck, staring at silly Scooter, feeling the winds shift. She looks back over her collar bone at the messy food-coated table, after each angel had spit out their chewed food particles.

The row of mountain birds sweep down in a graceful row and land down on the table, each chair, and the rock soil, picking up, eating each stray food particles as the mid-day meal. Once each object has been cleared and cleaned from each trashy item. Then the same flock of birds gracefully flies back up in formation and circles the air waves for the next meal from another group of messy angels.

Primus returns back and laughs at the weird event.

Veck cuddles with Bandy and chuckles at his silly angel friend. "And Scooter fights with his eyes shut and misses all of these tough demons that I gotta smack and attack for my fun."

"Naw, I don't." Scooter continues to walk backwards and laughs for fun.

He laughs. "And his mouth is wide open yelling with a series of girly screams from his running away direction."

"Naw, I don't." Scooter continues walks backwards with closed eyelids and a smile while avoiding every roaming angel, leading to the next section of fun within the Festival of Flight.

"Scooter is brave. Let and leave him be, Veck!" Bandy reaches over and slaps her clean hand into Veck's bicep with a smile. Veck leans over and kisses her lips.

"Of course, I am, hoss!" Scooter spins around and opens his eyeballs, stopping in front of the table, looking down with a smile. "Who can lay the biggest and smallest angel eggs?" He scans each item on the table.

The other angels stop and stare at the new set of natural rock-formed table that hold various tall and short items. Teague leans over and whispers into her cheekbone, surveying each item. "This is the angel art section. Each piece of art work has been created by a young angel for admiration."

Primus frowns at some of individual art objects. "Why would a young angel be taught to display their art work? Isn't current and future their angel work for a human or for the pleasure of the makers? Why would a young angel need the admiration of someone else? Your statement does not make any sense, to me, Teague."

"An angel does not lay down an egg, Scooter. You need to attend several of Jazmine's youngling's classes starting tomorrow morning at eight pm for numerous refresher courses on angels, which is us," Bandy still cuddles Veck and laughs at silly Scooter also.

Veck smiles, "Well, I hate to bust your pink tinted bubble here, man! But an egg lay or laying or dropping down from the angel's rectum is not an official Festival of Flight maneuver. I think you need a new pair of eyeballs."

"Yeah, it is. A brown tinted egg lay is an unofficial pooper, dooper maneuver coming from the other end of the body, behind the rear skull and below your wing tips. Get it! Got it, I'm good too." Scooter reaches out for the art work with a smile.

Veck releases his girl Bandy and uses his angel flash talent, retrieving a true eagle egg, placing down into Scooter's cupped hand, instead of the circular art work.

Scooter yells out loud with surprise and carefully juggles the egg back and forth within his hands as Bandy and Primus gasp in horror.

Primus drops down the shawl from her collar bone and grabs her face in terror.

Teague coughs out loud and then sneezes in a row with wet mucus hanging off his nostrils. He reaches down and sweeps down, retrieving the girly shawl from the ground and quickly covers her exposed halter dress over her exposed skin as her stinky demon odor causes each angels to cough out loud and then sneeze several times.

Scooter cuddles the egg with a smile into his chest and gently strokes the yellowish-black speckled home with the newborn eagle chick as the fragile egg lightly bursts open and reveals a tiny bleak from a white tinted chick. The tough little chick breaks free through its hard shell and appears, standing upright on the flat palm of Scooter, tilting its tiny furry head and leans over, harmlessly pecks at Scooter's chest.

Veck, Teague, Bandy, and Primus chuckle at the cute event.

"Mama is calling her baby back home, darling." Veck translates in bird language and grabs the chick, using his angel flash talent, returning the young chick back to the bird nest, disappearing from the mountain peak.

Primus turns and follows the angel dust trail with a sour frown. "That wasn't very nice for an angel, Veck."

"It was really funny, sorta angel humor and what not, Prims!" Teague laughs with his angel friends at the humorous event.

"Not to me!" Primus frowns with a whisper at the serious and dangerous action by Veck and Scooter.

March 6th Wednesday

01:04 p.m.

City of Boston within the US State of Massachusetts

Year 1770 A.D.

Cold temperatures 42 degrees Fahrenheit

Gray clouds and light snowflakes

with 12 miles-per-hour winds east by northeast

Court house setting

Each angel within the circle plopped down on the hard pavement as an odor of smell smoke offended each set of nostrils and a set of faint voices invaded each pair of angel eardrums during the newest Accipio event. Each pair of eyelids opened and surveyed the new landscape.

Each one swiftly stood upright from the hard pavement and viewed a dark smelly dirt covered alleyway behind an active brick coated warehouse building in front a single dirt covered street. Each angel moved in pairs or along among the crowd of screams of angry, tears of sadness, shouts of war with an individual weapon displaying a sword or a hammer or a glass vase without the dead flowers. The wet dirt ground was covered in pockets of powered snowflakes or wet puddles of slush.

Four city blocks were filled with standing and swaying individual, wearing pretty fur coats with hats or dark colored wool coverings and a thick scarf from the cold weather.

Five rows held a stationary British war soldier, who did not sweat but sneered at each passing citizen during a cold and cloudy day in March. Each soldier displayed a red colored jacket, a pair of black tinted trousers, and a set of white tinted leggings holding a sword in their cupped hand. Each British soldier stood besides an American Indian.

Each American Indian displayed animal-covered, beige and brown feather caps on each skull and matching clothes over their dark brown tinted skin.

Scooter led the party of angels through the crowded wet slush and brown mud and chuckled at the social event. "O! We have landed down into a Halloween party. I wanna dress for the fun occasion too. Why didn't someone tell me before we crash-landed here?"

"They can't see us here within the new Accipio event. Don't you remember that fact, Scooter?" Bandy slowly strolled ahead of Veck and scanned the new landscape for demon Priam.

"O yeah! Right!" Scooter stared at the noisy crowd.

Teague shoved Primus ahead of his boots through the thick throng of people and followed behind the row of Veck, Scooter and Bandy for protection. "We have landed down in the rural town of Boston in year 1770. Does that time frame ring a bell within your mind, Prims?"

Veck continued to shuffle slowly through the crowd and searched for demon Priam, so angel Primus could finish the Un-learneth task. Then they all would leave Boston and fly towards another Accipio event. He cleared his throat. "Last night, it was a cold and snowy day on March, the fifth, in the year 1770. When a mod of angry Americans came to view that house over there and started bad mouthing the row of British soldiers, like usual during this early time period of American History. The King had sent over large sailing ships with more stiff-upper lipped British troops that talked funny to enforce more money taxes on more items every rich and poor citizen here in Boston. There was a fight with muskets and five Americans died right here. Geez!" He stopped and stared down in the snow that was covered in red blood. "Goodness! The five men died right here!" He scooted around the blood stain on the packed snow in the dirt and moved ahead with a stern face. "Wait your step! Don't smear the blood!" He followed Scooter and continued to scan the crowd for demon Priam.

"So, we have arrived the day after the infamous Boston Massacre of 1770. That explains all the sad and mad residents of Boston." Bandy followed Scooter and continued to scan for demon Priam.

Teague exhaled with annoyance. "Yeah, we have entered into the anti-social party of the year."

Scooter led through the crowds and searched for demon Priam. "After the five deaths of the devoted and faithful American citizens, yesterday, tenses were high and spirits were floating. Then on December 16th, in the year 1773, the Boston Tea Party occurred. That politically motivated resistance movement traveled fasting than hurricane winds throughout old British America, when the Crown had forced the collection of additional British money taxes on the import English tea bags for each American and British citizen to pay and make the King richer than before. The rebellious American colonists attended the party event and tossed all the English tea bags overboard from the boat and down into the harbor water. Both of these two events ignited the hell spark plug for the great American Revolutionary War in the year 1775 between the not-so-great Great Britain and the brave, tough, fierce and crazy American colonists that lived within thirteen tiny American Colonies, who came, fought, and won their freedom and independence. Hoo-wah!"

Veck frowned. "We all know that shared information. We were there too. Don't you remember that tidbit of American history, Scooter?"

Bandy frowned. "No! We were not present here."

Veck smiled. "Okay! We had heard about the event from gossip which almost seemed like we were here during the Boston Massacre when the commanding officer at the Customs House, which was located back there. We are slowly moving ahead towards the court house through this throng of cold bodies and heated tempers. British Captain Thomas Preston..."

Primus stopped in place and gasped in shock. "Captain Thomas Preston..."

Teague squeezed beside Primus and sneered into her cheekbone. "Preston, was he the one in charge of the five kills here?" She nodded in silence and stared at the court house.

Scooter nodded. "Wow! You're right, as usual, Teague."

Teague sneered with disgust and cuddled Primus into his chest, shoving away each upright cold body from their footpath, shuffling ahead through the crowds that were lingering in front of the court house steps.

Scooter led the party of angels around the angry crowds, some peeing dogs, and lots of whining children, landing on the bottom of the bricked stones that was lined up with people. The people were listening to the verbal legal court arguments that echoed into the cold air waves coming from inside the court room.

Primus narrated the story and followed the back spine on Veck through the same crowd. "Preston, he was the British officer of the 29th Regiment of Foot. This is his legal trial that was held here in Boston, Massachusetts and the future US President John Adams was his defense attorney."

Teague shoved more cold bodies aside and climbed each step, cuddling Primus, entering a heated room with more cold bodies as each wall, the floor, and every sitting pew had been filled with sweaty and stinky folks, mostly males.

Teague scooted against the entrance wall and shoved more people to the side, cuddling with Primus.

The rest of the angels slowly blended into the new scenery standing in the middle of the floor or tucked into an empty space on the wall.

His eyeballs darted around the room and examined each people, identifying the female sitting on the first pew near the side wall, smashing her petite body against the wooden armrest.

Demon Priam wore a long gown consisting of a red and pink flowered bodice over a separate silk beige petticoat down to her covered two ankle bones. A pair of brass buckled shoes covered her pink tinted silk stockings. Her hands were covered in a pair of fingerless elbow-length white mitts and her fashionable hat is very shallow, sitting flat on her crown and attached to a wide brim in wool hat with a pink bow tied in back of her covered neck. Her face was covered in a shimmery golden veil.

Teague could not see the glittering sparkles from her shimmery veil that had quickly identified demon Priam.

Teague pulled angel Primus into his chest and whispered down into her eardrum. "I see demon Priam. She is seated in the first row on the left side down the same wall, which is closest to us. Go on and sneak down and touch her collar bone, like usual. Then, we can leave here and visit the next Accipio event."

Primus darted her eyeballs around the room and located her demon self and slowly shuffled away from Teague, carefully moving down the side wall with numerous wooden pews, staring at red demon figure inside the eyewitness box inside the wooden chair.

Primus could hear his deep bass rumble and smell his familiar leather and sharp citrus body fragrance that easily had identified Preston.

Inside the wooden box, Preston regally sat like a prince and smiled at his attorney John Adams.

John Adams viewed the judge and continued to ask numerous questions to Preston that was related to the massacre of each dead American citizen within the snow-covered dirt street here in Boston, yesterday evening.

His red tinted wings were inflated and glittered in red rubies and as his deep voice continued to answer each question without missing a beat, not paying close attention to his demon girlfriend Priam, who was crashed in-between wooden armrest and an obese man in the rough blue tinted long coat.

Primus reached the first pew and then stopped, standing slightly behind the sitting golden veiled girl, reaching out, gingerly tapped the collar bone on the veiled girl with an index finger.

Inside the eyewitness box, demon Preston stopped talking and jerked his face to view Priam. Demon Priam completely disappeared from the pew seat. He sneered in angry and narrowed his eyeballs at angel Primus.

His red body swiftly flashed into six feet and six inches of mesomorph flesh and bone, a head of naturally wavy blonde hair, a rectangle face, a strong squared-jaw, and a pair of dark green eyeballs against his olive skin. He wore a dark red tinted battle gear uniform consisting of a sleeveless vest, a pair of trousers that were tucked down into a matching pair of knee high boots. Preston swiftly stood upright from the chair and pulled out a golden curved sword with his fighting right hand, reaching out with his free hand the empty spot on the pew that had held Priam. His eyeballs shifted and located angel Primus and as he gasped in shock.

Primus appeared with a head of long straight brown hair with natural gold highlights, a tone of pale skin, a pair of turquoise colored eyes, standing five feet and two inches in body height with a pair of short legs and a long waistline at the end of the first pew.

Primus gasped in shock and spun around to see Teague. Inside the eyewitness stand, Preston slowly turned and viewed a second familiar face, Teague. He gasped and then growled in shock.

Against the entrance wall, Teague yelled out loud threateningly death and pulled out his silver tinted sword, "Preston, here I am. Come and get me, ya beautiful demon fool."

Preston quickly re-focused his eyesight and spotted three more beautiful angels that were scattered along the entrance wall in-between the dead historically people, leaping up from the wooden chair with a sneer, rolling his body into a tight somersault, flying ahead, clearing twenty feet of both sitting citizens and wooden pews. He landed behind angel Primus and jerked her into his chest, whipping his demon sword in the air waves, sneering at Teague.

Primus struggled side to side and slapped both of them into the side row of glass windows, freeing her body, escaping from Preston. She raced down the side pews with worry running towards Teague.

Teague dashed from the entrance wall and raced around each standing human towards Primus to kill Preston, turning with a stern face at Scooter, commanding. "Come here and grab Prims and get outta of here, Scooter! I'll take out the trash." He returned back and laughed at Preston's future bloody death.

Scooter moved from the opposite end of the long entrance wall and raced behind the last wooden pew towards the side wall to intercept with Primus.

On the last pew, a tall figure slowly stood upright from the seat and spun around, standing six feet and two inches with a pair of wide shoulders, a pair of narrow hips, a diamond-shaped face with a tone of mocha colored skin. He displayed a head of short dark brown curly hair and a pair of light brown eyes with golden specks, smelling with a fragrance of wild clove and basil, magically shifting a boot toe through the wooden pew into the empty aisle with a smirk in silence.

Scooter rushed beside the last wooden pew that provided a nice aisle of empty space passing each stationary rear skull with a colorful hat or a hair of colored hair, beautifully tripping over the tip on a perturbed brown colored military boot, landing hard down the wooden with a heavy grunt. He busted his nose bridge and cut his jaw line flinging his blood proteins in the air, down on the floor, onto Blaze's boot.

Blaze laughed out loud and magically walked through the solid wooden pew like an angel, but a demon, whipping his golden tinted curved saber in the air, dripping the sharp pointy tip down towards Scooter's rear skull with a loud sneer.

Scooter swiftly rolled sideways from the descending golden tinted saber tip which missed his body and laughed out loud. He sat upright on the floor at his kneecap and stared at the unfamiliar demon, "Ya missed me, demon boy."

Blaze smiled and whipped the sword side to side in front of his sneer, killing the air molecules, without harming a single historical human. "Good! I get another try for an angel death." He leaped up from the floor and flew through the air at Scooter, leveling his sword parallel to the floor for a second killing strike at Scooter's heart.

Scooter leaped up from his crouch on the floor and arched his silver tinted sword over his hair roots at Blaze as each weapons violently clashed in an X-shaped form, creating an array of musical ringing in bell tones. They hovered in the air and continued to fight, missing a pumping heart, hitting each limb with a loud sneer.

Primus stopped in alarm inside the empty aisle on the side wall of glass windows and stared with worry at the two fighting males, one in red battle gear and the other in white hue.

A tall figure of five feet and eight inches with an endomorph frame, a pair of short legs, a row of stout muscular shoulders, a tone of bronze colored skin and a square face, wearing a buzz cut of exposed honey blonde roots. He displayed a pair of intense hazel-green colored eyes and smelled like a fresh batched of wild blackberries from the plant vine. He flashed from the regular street clothes into his red battle gear and held a golden tinted curved sword, bending his two kneecaps, leaping from the floor. He flew upwards and stopped mid-air, standing in a blind spot behind angel Scooter, who continued to bloody and fight with demon Blaze.

Demon Radium reared back his pointy tip sword with a smirk in silence and punched his arm forward performing a cowardly back stabbing maneuver on angel Scooter.

Scooter shot up into the ceiling planks and hit the hard wood, falling back down with dizziness, flying forward from Radium and Blaze towards the entrance wall corner, hovering in the air waves. He wiped off the blood smears with a sneer of hate.

On the floor, beside the row of glass windows, on the side wall, Teague continued with grunt with heavy breathes and battle with fiery heated sparks from his sword and Preston's golden saber, shouting out loud to Primus. "Get outta of here, Prims!"

A tall, slender figure with six feet and three inched of pale colored ectomorph body slowly stood upright from the middle wooden pew beside the same row of glass windows, wearing a head of long golden blonde naturally straight hair, smelling of lavender, velvet, and silky plum fragrance. He spun around with a gasp and stared at a stationary Primus on the side wall, calling out with worry, "Priam!"

Morton swung from the pew and swiftly dashed ahead towards Primus, holding both arms in the air. Primus spun a face and viewed Morton.

Angel Veck deftly landed down on booted feet in front of Morton, on the same aisle, beside the row of glass windows, rearing back his sword, slicing sideways at Morton and completely missed the demon. Slamming the tip of his sword into the glass on the window which nicely parted like magic, without making sound or breaking the smooth glass. Veck turned and gasped at the tip of his sword that hung outside in the light snow and bright sunlight and inside the enclosed glass material, slowly pulling out his sword with a smile.

Morton leaped backwards with a gasp from a stunned Veck and then produced a set of inflated red tinted demon wings, flying above Veck's hair roots with light speed for to save Priam, yelling at Radium.

Radium swiftly dropped down from the air waves and landed in front of Veck, slamming his saber into the angel's whipping sword while creating numerous ting-ping musical sounds. Radium laughed and blocked Veck's sword, flicking his own saber to the side, punching his fist into the angel's jaw line.

Veck launched away from Radium with a yell and landed down on the aisle floor. Radium spun around with a smirk and grabbed Primus by her forearm.

Bandy dropped down from the ceiling and appeared behind Radium, slicing her sword at the red tinted tee shirt on Radium's back spine, exposing his pale skin, without a bloody mark. She gasped in alarm. Radium shoved Primus with a loud grunt towards the open archway for her safety from angel Bandy.

Scooter looked down with a smile and viewed Primus, swiftly dropping down from the ceiling, slamming his booted feet on the extended naked arm on Radium. Radium hit the floor and busted his lips, flying upwards with a growl, spitting out his blood proteins in the air and over the floor. He spun around and raised his sword, hearing the musical tone. He felt the vibration from the violent impact and blocked the parry from Bandy's sword and reached out, trying to reach Bandy.

Bandy gasped in alarm and back stepped from Radium, leaping from the floor, flying over the demon and reached down. She tried to grab angel Primus in the air.

On the floor, Veck flew upwards from the floor and then sidestepped from Radium's sideways sword falling down into the pew of people that slowly scooted from his grounded body.

Radium turned and sneered at the back spine on angel Teague, performing a one-hand twirl with his gigantic sword, slowly advancing into the fight with Preston to kill Teague first.

She slowly stood at five feet and ten inches in height with waist-length naturally straight black colored hair, a tone of black tinted skin, a pair of amber tinted eyes, wearing a pair of inflated red wings, smelling with fresh bouquet of wild orchids. Barbie laughed at the intriguing action and then launched from the pew seat on the second row, prettily twirling her body in the air, dropping down on top of Bandy's back spine.

Both females slammed a pretty face down on the floor hard and then rolled out of control over the wet wood, stopping with heavy pants of pain. Demon Barbie lost her golden tinted curved sword,

Angel Bandy leaped up from the floor and hovered for one second in the air, stomping her boot heel down on top of a set of nicely manicured orange tinted finger nails on the demon. Barbie screamed in pain and kicked out her foot, collecting with Bandy's big nose.

Bandy jerked to the left and released her sword, holding her bloody nose, shuffling to the right with dizziness and exposed her unprotected gut stomach.

Demon girl Barbie leaped up from the floor with a growl and bent down with a sneer, dashing ahead, ramming her bone skull into the exposed stomach on Bandy. The two females connected and started to battle hand-to- hand without a metal weapon, pulling each strand of long shiny hair, gouging a pair of two manicured fingernails into each other eyeballs, spitting out strands of nasty tongue salvia on each cheekbone that stuck and felt like a wet, sticky piece of cold nose snot.

"Demon coodies!" Bandy yelled out loud with laughter and continued to fight with demon Barbie.

Barbie laughed, "Angel hair!" She violently ripped out a handful plug from Bandy's scalp and cheered with her victory.

Bandy released her enemy and quickly back stepped, crying out in pain, touching her missing hair strands.

Veck leaped up in the air from the empty pew seat and stood upright on top of the floor, swiftly dashing ahead with a sneer, reaching out for her rear neck muscles, connecting to Barbie. He quickly lifted the demon in the air with of his one powerful arm biceps and then swiftly tossed the female over into the forward wall. She hit the solid wall of stone and then slowly slid down behind the judge's chair, disappearing from sight.

The crowd of people continued to hear James Adams' arguments, defending his innocent client.

On the side wall of glass windows, Veck leaned down and grabbed Bandy, cuddling her into his rib cage, jerking Primus into his other rib cage. They dashed ahead and swiftly exited the court house building, leaping from the snowy dirt, flying in the skyline back to the drop zone, after completing the Un-learneth task.

Inside the building, on the side wall, Teague successfully cut through Preston's battle vest, slicing at the hard muscle but missed the demon's pumping, cursing at his failure.

Preston jumped backwards with fright from the angel's sword and halted, looking down, staring at the bloody wound and then laughed. He looked up and sneered at Teague.

Scooter dropped down from the wall corner after wiping off the numerous body wounds, landing down in front of the open archway, blocking for his three angel friends while they had escaped safely into the light snowy afternoon.

Scooter stood in place and lifted up his sword, crossing with a lout ting sound with Blaze's saber, growling into the demon's face. Scooter released one cupped hand from his sword and reared back the elbow, slamming a folded fist into Blaze's rib cage, exhaling with a heavy grunt.

The rib cage nosily cracked a few bones from the angel's fist inside Blaze's body while his bones crash and smash below Scooter's fist. Blaze bowed down at a fitted waist from pain and dropped forward towards Scooter's body.

Scooter awarded his finale gift into Blaze's eye socket with a second folded fist using all his of angel powers, watching Blaze launch sideways into the row of glass windows.

Blaze's body easily penetrated through the glass window, during the Accipio event within Primus' mind, without breakage or noise and then halted his upper body in a sideways pose at the bruised rib cage, screaming out loud in pain in the bright sunshine and a light snow shower.

Scooter stood upright with a smile and dropped down his sword, starting through the clean glass window, pondering how cute Blaze would appear tomorrow morning with a set of new forming yellow bruise around his single eye socket with a complimentary bloody nose.

"Teague, move it!" Scooter yelled out loud at the back spine on Teague.

Teague continued to battle with Preston beside the row of glass windows, hearing Scooter's words, turning to see only Scooter among his angel friends, laughing out loud.

Primus had been successfully with the Un-learneth task and had escaped again from Preston.

Scooter swiftly scooted out the court house building with ease while watching Teague.

On the side wall near the wall corner, Teague returned back and sneered at Preston, slashing his sword tip at Preston's belly, kicking his boot toe in Preston's face.

Preston paced backwards from the frontal attack, when Teague leaped forward and stomped the boot toe on the demon, forcing Preston to bow down like a lowly peasant to the mighty Teague.

Teague smiled and two-fisted gripes his sword, preparing mentally and physically to decapitate Preston at his neck muscles, driving down the vertical silver sword into Preston's neck for the final kill.

The sword hit metal, not flesh.

Teague turned and gasped in shock, seeing Radium. Radium held Teague's sword tip with both of his naked hands, sneering at the angel.

Teague cursed and jerked his sword free, running backwards from Radium back down the clear aisle, laughing out loud with his perfect escape.
Radium chased ahead after Teague with an array of sneers and hisses for the final death kill, swinging his sword sideways, killing the air molecules only.

Teague spun around for a swift and safe escape through the open archway and raced ahead, slamming into a pair of sideways legs with two red booted feet, which was the lower body part on a stationary and stuck demon Blaze. Teague dropped down on top of the floor, yelling in both pain and surprise.

Radium raced ahead and gasped in shock, colliding into Blaze's leg, jumping in the air. Blaze shuffled through the other side of the glass window and dropped down into a pile of soft snowflakes, wiggling his body, yelling out loud in fright.

On the floor, Teague raced ahead flat down on his back spine and flew his ground body in forward motion over the dirty floor, traveling underneath an air-born Radium, exiting through the open archway. He halted on top of the rough first stone step and then leaped in the air from the ground, quickly inflating out his angel wings, swiftly flying away from the group of demons inside the court house.

Inside the court house building, demon Radium quickly landed down on top of the aisle floor and swiftly raced outside with a sneer, colliding into a set of upright human bodies while searching for angel Teague.

Each human body felt a presence and slowly scooted sideways from the footfalls on Radium, revealing a surprise.

Angel Scooter stood in the middle of an angry crowd of citizen alone with a smile and patiently waited for any demon to come closer towards his exposed presence, whipping his arm through the air, tossing a handful of wet dirt, snow, and a few pieces of hard street trash into Radium's face. Scooter bent down and covered his own two eyeballs from the nasty flying debris.

Radium gasped in shock and closed his eyeballs, when a hard spray of trash items hit his face and chest. He dropped down and shook each nasty item from his face, missing Scooter's escape.

In the air waves, angel Scooter dived down from the skyline and landed hard on the pavement, joining the circle of angels, sitting down in a cross-legged pose beside Primus, closing his eyelids and laughed with amusement.

Primus continued to sit beside Teague and closed her eyelashes, mentally envisioning another one of her past demon memories as the circle of bloody and beaten angels flashed away into the new Accipio event.

Each beaten and bloody angel within the same circle landed down hard on top of the dry white colored sand grains. Rows of bobbing sea ships swayed within the deep blue colored ocean waters while making some of the people seasick. An array of faint voices hushed with softness on top of the sands.

A thick blanket of fog mysterious appeared inside the bay and along the sandy shoreline. In the far distance, four small row boats approached the sparkling white tinted sands and maneuvered around the treacherous high tide with bluish-green waves that crashed and churned within the rough ocean water smashing into the large hull on each sailing vessel. Four Spanish ships composed of 200 men: priests, farmers, artisans, slaves, and one female.

Within the circle, Primus swiftly stood upright from the sands and scanned the new environment, blinking her eyelids from the bright beams of sunlight and whips of windy salt spray in the air, pointing at a row of small boats, shouting out loud to each team member. "There! She's over there."

"We missed them." Scooter swiftly stood upright from the sand and surveyed the same semi-crooked line of four row boats heading towards one of the large sailing ship with a deep sigh of disappointment.

"Row, row, row your boat..." Veck quickly stood upright from the sands and then leaned down, assisting his girl Bandy to stand on top of the dry sand, singing out loud with musical harmony. He cuddled his girl and stared over the sands and then viewed the ocean waves.

"Gently by the stream..." Scooter sung in baritone with a smile.

"Where are we?" Bandy continued to fix her absent hair strands on the rear of her skull, where that nasty demon gal had yanked out some of her angel blonde tinted hair roots.

Primus surveyed the dark waters as her angel senses picked up sharks, whales, and other sea creatures. "That's the vast and deep Atlantic Ocean. We are located on the sandy shoreline coast of present day Melbourne Beach."

"Go and grab a boat, hoss!" Scooter pointed at a crooked row of beached row boats on top of the wet sands that might lead to demon Priam.

Near beachside, several feet from the row of angels, a tall human male stood in the wet sand in a purple colored silk short coat over a dull white colored shirt with his pair of black pants tucked down into his pair black thigh-high boots. His Cavalier hat with a white colored plume of peacock feather bounced side to side and as he spread both arms over the white sands and shouted out loud with a smile, slapping his wet chest. "I, Ponce de Leon, hail this new land as La Florida, in the year 1513 in the month of April, the second."

Each crew member stood in a loose circle and meekly clapped for their captain. A light wind breeze flowed gently through the air waves. Faint noises pierced the air currents coming from the hidden mysterious native wildlife behind a grove of tall palm trees on the newly christened _La Florida_.

Within the loose circle of people, Preston handsomely donned his red tinted 23 feet demon wings and held onto Priam's yellow tinted gloved hand. Her facial features posed underneath the golden veil and as her body displayed a rose colored ankle-length cotton dress and a light tined straw hat over her light brown hairy skull as a protection shield from the harsh sunrays.

Primus spotted the circle of humans with a gasp and raced ahead from the other angels with determination.

The other angels turned to see the commotion with a gasp and raced ahead, catching up with Primus.

Teague pulled up beside Primus, tucking her into his chest while observing demon Preston within the circle of humans. He leaned over and whispered into her cheekbone. "Touch her!" He stopped in a line with the rest of the angels and then gently shoved Primus towards the rear skull on the couple, nodding in silence to finish the Accipio dream.

She slowly moved ahead behind demon Priam and stared at a bun of light brown hair and the part of frontal glimmering veil, stopping behind the collar bone on demon Priam. She reached out and gently tapped down at the collar bone on Priam, quickly lifting up her hand.

Demon Priam quickly disappeared into nothingness.

Stationary Preston gasped in shock and then spun around to see angel Primus, quickly morphing his body into a tone of olive tinted flesh with white bones, displaying his ripped and torn red colored demon battle vest, exposing slashes of ripped and torn chest muscles underneath. He extended his free hand and smiled calling out to her, "Priam, Please, come to me, Priam."

"Get away from him!" Teague dashed ahead and reached out, grabbing the collar bone on angel Primus, jerkin her away from Preston. He slid her behind his back spine and lifted his sword in front of his sneer towards Preston, "Stay behind me, Prims!"

Preston switched his eyesight and then sneered at Teague.

Blaze, Barbie, Morton, and Radium quietly leaped up from a row of tall white colored sand dunes that had appeared like a row of dirt, jumping in the air, acrobatically dropping down in a straight line behind the Santiago crew of sailors and farmers. Each demon banished a golden tinted sword as the metal glittered in the sunlight along with dried angel blood proteins for next fight.

Within the row of angels, Veck turned and frowned at Scooter, "To soon enough, for me!"

Scooter laughed with a wink at beaten up Radium, "I love to play sooner rather than later, hoss!"

The group of beaten and bloody angels had left the year 1770 in the rural town Boston within the American colonies, after a surprise encounter and vicious fight with Preston and his team of talented demons. Each demon had flashed alive and breathing in red hue into the Accipio dream coming from angel Primus.

A black tinted bruise on demon Blaze prettily surrounded his eye socket. Preston proudly displayed fresh skin red cuts and purple-blue bruises on his face, both of his arms, his neck, and his exposed chest muscles, where the sharp tip from Teague's sword had done a good job with his expert angel marksmanship.

Teague continued to stand and snorted back at the newest demon and angel matchup while desirously wanting to end the final fight with his non-buddy-boy into a heap of bloody skin and broken bones while dying in front of his two blue tinted eyeballs.

Scooter, Bandy, and Veck equally stared down a demon within the offensive line for an offensive demon collision with their sword and a set of sore muscles, since Primus was the grand prize and did not fight, because Preston's goal was to acquire Priam back to the Demon Den from him evil purposes.

On top of the sand, Primus safely hid behind Teague's back spine without her sword, staring at Preston.

Teague reached back with a free hand and violently shoved Primus away from the fight towards one of the bobbing row boats inside the ocean waters, getting away from Preston.

From the demon lineup, Radium leaped up from the sands with a growl and then soared into the clouds on exploded wings, confusing the Angel linebackers.

Scooter gracefully copied Radium's flying maneuver. Radium wildly performed a body spin using his wings, his body, and his forward saber at a flying sword from Scooter, creating a set of lovely musical tones along with bad verbal angry words that echoed across the pale blue skies.

On the ground, each angel raced ahead and impacted into a demon on top of the white tinted sands here in present day Melbourne Beach within the US State of Florida in the year 1513.

Primus quickly spun around with a gasp and tumbled over the dry sand towards a new spot, crouching down on top of the sand, hiding between two beached row boats and watching the deadly action.

In a weird unexplained celestial science fact, a single demon memory did not impact any of the human occupants from the past world historical event as each supernatural being danced on top of the sands, in the air, and over the water around each upright and stationary sailor, priest, farmer, land wildlife, and flying sea gull.

Demon girl Barbie slammed down the angel sword and then swiftly back stepped, laughing at angel girl Bandy. "I do love your new do, girlfriend." She had referenced an obviously the missing patch of brown colored hair strands on Bandy's bone skull.

"O! You do! Then, please, allow me to return that hairy favor, babe." Bandy rushed ahead with her sword parallel with the sand straight at Barbie's heart as each female performed a vicious sword fence with a set of chanting musical tones.

Demon guy Blaze leaned down and whispered a set of secret words down into Morton's eardrum. Blaze stood upright with a sneer and violently shoved Morton from his body and any angel harm, reaching up, blocking the sword tip from angel Veck.

Morton was not good with his set of demon fighting skills, only good with his pod of demon talking traits. Morton quickly back pedaled from Blaze and the new fight, racing blind, tripping over first scattered row of dead tree logs and pieces of dry wood, landing backward in the soft sand.

Blaze flipped his upright body into a forward motion and launched upside down through the at Veck with his demon surprise and his supernatural speed as the two fighters continue to bump together, stumble apart, and land down on top of the sands, up in the air waves, and back down on the ground. Each one rolled over the soft sand as each sword nick landed on a fleshy body producing red tinted blood, body sweat, and eye tears for an anticipated kill death.

On top of the sand, Teague continued to stand without fighting and watched Preston.

Preston had not lifted his sword in the air to defend his demon person but slowly strolled sideways from Teague, moving ahead towards the bobbing row of smaller boats, staring at angel Primus. He shouted out loud, "Priam! Please, come to me, Priam!"

Teague gasped in shock that Preston had dared to pursue Primus so bold and brave in front of his two angel eyeballs and then sneered with revenge and jealously, turning towards the same row boats, moving ahead with a parallel stance beside Preston towards Primus. Teague looked back over a collar bone and viewed each angel, who was engaging the supernatural fight in the air and on the sand using a sword, a fist, and any available land object, such like, a dead tree stump, tree limbs, and parts of each sand dune, except for demon Morton.

Demon Morton was more a female type rather than a male character.

Literally on top of the sandy ground, Morton sprawled over each dead tree limb and then shook his head, clearing his mind and watched the fight. He gasped in alarm and leaped up from the sands, spinning around in the air from the bloody fight, landing back down on the sand. He raced ahead with panic and then spotted an opening within a clustering of tall shade trees and curved tree trunks for a shelter of protection.

Teague softly chuckled. "That makes one less demon in the fight giving a set of better odds for the angel offensive to score each final bloody demon death kill." He returned back and posed his sword in front of his chest, continuing to rush ahead and sideways behind Preston.

In the wet shoreline, Preston circled the far row boat and held his saber down by his kneecap, slowly moving closer to Primus, rounding the last boat and as his pair of red tinted knee boots splashed around the shallow water. Then he stopped and stared down at angel Primus in silence. Behind the boat, Primus looked away from Teague and viewed Preston in silence. He reached out with an open palm toward Primus, without invading her hidey hole, whispering with worry. "Priam, please, come with me!"

Teague raced parallel with Preston, the boat, and Primus, sneering with angry.

Near the thick green tinted grove of tall and curved shade trees, Morton swiftly whipped his lean body around the four giant sun-bathing sea turtles, three lounging alligators, and scaring to death hundreds of nesting sea gulls, who had been munching on ghost crabs. He dashed ahead with a giggle and viewed the dark, safe opening, hiding for his safety until Radium's rescue for the group of annoying angels. He darted side to side eluding each land and flying mammal, skirting along the edge of scattered tree limbs. He tripped over a hidden row of massive tree limbs. His belly flopped down over several of the broken limbs with his skull hanging mid-air, viewing the cave.

Morton slowly performed a belly crawl using both of his palms, sliding both of his legs over the rows of dead tree limbs, crawling across the sand. He tried to lift his right hand out of the sand for the next step with a loud grunt and looked down, seeing his right hand and all five finger had been stuck down into "wetter than normal" white tinted sand.

He halted in place and turned with worry, viewing the distance shoreline, returning back. He lifted up his left hand from the "wetter than normal sand" in the air and wiggled both kneecaps side to side without moving forward with a gasp.

He had become stuck inside the "wetter than normal" sand and violently tried to jerk out his stuck right hand, both of his two kneecaps, and two legs. His body gracefully sunk down further into the "wetter than normal" sand. He gasped in panic and turned to view Radium, who exhibited an angel on the rear of his tail feathers.

In the air waves, Radium sliced sideways at Scooter's exposed throat and missed while viciously cursing. Scooter quickly back stepped from the demon and victoriously laughed from the loss kill.

On the ground, down inside the wet sand, Morton whispered out loud the cursed word in horror, "Quicksilver." He reached out towards the thick green tinted leaves on a beautifully overhanging tree limb shading part of hidden white tinted quick sand with his right hand and then screamed with a heart-breaking defeat as the flock of low-flying seagulls lovingly mimic his cries of panic into an array of musically sounds in the air and over the beach sand.

Morton continued to struggle outwards with one free hand for the lovely bent tree limb while slowly sinking down into the mire of quicksand that had engulfed both of his boots and lower legs, quickly covering both of his kneecaps, swiftly moving up his belly button.

Radium turned and frowned towards a familiar scream seeing Morton's skull, only. His head is barely sticking out above a grounded tree trunk.

Scooter back stepped from Radium while panting from the vicious fighting, staring ahead at the same spot where Radium was searching.

Radium gasped in alarm and then spun around with a sneer, violently slicing his saber downward, cutting Scooter's naked arm and drew angel blood. Scooter quickly flew backwards with a shocked gasp. Radium spun around and swiftly flew ahead towards Morton for the rescue.

Scooter slowly spun in a circle on his pair of gracefully wings, landing down at his two kneecaps on the dry sand, twirling a set of tiny sand tornados in the air. He wiped off the blood with a set of loud curses words and slowly stood upright on top of the sand, sneering at the nasty demon, staring ahead with a gasp of shock. He viewed a "stuck in the sand and out of luck" demon Morton and smiled with an evil chuckle.

On the shoreline, in the shallow waves, at the row of crooked row boats, Teague rushed at an angle with a straight sword tip towards the last row boat, connecting and then sliced into Preston's exposed rear bicep muscle, cutting the skin down to the white tinted bone. He jerked the tip from the red colored flesh laughing out loud.

Preston gasped in pain, dashed ahead into the ocean waters, and then halted, spinning around with a sneer, viewing Teague. He ignored the pain in his arm and drew his saber up towards the clouds, dropping the blade downwards, tearing an opening into heart position on Teague's worn, tore, and bloody white tinted battle vest, nicking chest hairs on Teague.

Preston coated his saber with angel skin and blood, laughing out loud.

In the pale blue sky, Radium hovered over Morton and swished each wing to remain air-borne, studying the beach landscape, mentally working the best method for withdrawing the demon out from the quick sand. Morton was a demon with blood, bones, and organs, like a human, where his bones could be harmed from a violent impact or a sword blade. Then Morton would disappear into nothingness as a pile of drifting red ashes into the sunset here on Planet Earth.

On the sand, Scooter bent at his two kneecaps and lifted off the sand, flying high into the clouds, following the rows of thick drifting clouds that covered his angel presence. He looked down with a soft chuckle through the wet mist of water molecules and easily spotted an air-bore Radium in thought and a trapped Morton in more danger, diving down like a bird, screeching like a seagull with his clever disguise. He swiftly passed Radium and veered his flight in-between the lovely hanging tree limb and Morton's exposed skull without his demon body that floated inside the quick sand. He guided a sideways sword parallel towards even with the lumpy sand and decapitated beautifully the skull precisely at the neck muscles as Morton's headless body slumped sideways and then dropped down into the quicksand, slowly disappearing from each pair of eyeballs.

"Morton!" Radium screamed in horror and scared more of the eating seagulls into flight from the beach sands, hovering in the air waves in fear, sadness, angry, and depression.

Scooter swiftly veered to the side and circled the tree trunk, flying upwards back into the loud, laughing out loud with his revenge.

In the shallow ocean waters, demon leader Preston stopped fighting and looked up at Radium with a gasp, leaping from the sands, soaring beautifully with his exploded red wings in the air. Winged pair, boyfriend Blaze and girlfriend Barbie trailed behind his red tail feathers to the bloody scene also.

The angel-demon skirmish had lasted less than ten minutes with flying blood proteins, broken bones, and seared feathers, affecting not one Spaniard or Native Indian or servant, but one demon.

In the shallow water, behind the last row boat, angel Primus continued to crouch and watched the rear back spine on Preston, hearing the familiar scream, swiftly standing upright from the wet sand. She viewed a decapitated skull on dead Morton that slowly sunk down into the hidden quick sand and sobbed with her sad tears, screaming out loud in pain also for her demon friend.

Teague ignored each ear-piercing sound coming from his girl Primus and the pod of other nasty demons and covered the loud noise with his evil laughter, enjoying the tragic demon show, swiftly stumbling over the wet sand to Primus. He stopped and cuddled her with a smile, slowly dropping them down on top of the wet sand. Each angel dived down and formed a loose circle.

Teague leaned over and touched her wet cheekbone of tears, whispering softly. "Think of another memory, Prims!" He sat back and closed his eyelids, smiling with victory for him and Primus.

Primus closed her wet eyelashes and whispered for her eardrums only, "Good bye, Morton! I love you," she sobbed with more tears and then mentally formed the next demon memory, creating a new Accipio dream state with her deep sadness and loss.

Then, the group of angels swiftly disappeared from the sandy shoreline.

Angel Haven location

Inside her private bedroom, Primus still feels tired and exhausted within each one her biological senses including emotional, physical, mental, social, and spiritual. She sits upright inside her warm and soft bed mattress on Angel Haven, after Jazmine's un-welcomed and un-announced visitation on the early morning hour with Teague and the other angels from the last Accipio dream.

Jazmine had firmly reminded in her scratchy alto that Primus was doing a good job of losing each one of her demon memories with only one more demon memory to go. Then, fifty million years of fun and play with demon leader Preston would be gone foreverly.

After the full completion and processing from the Accipio dream concept, Primus will become an angel with her re-loaded set of ancient and young angel memories popping up in the air like a pod of fresh daisies during springtime. So she needed to continue to fertilize her set of sleepy brain cells as a developing angel.

Inside her bed mattress, Primus snorts out loud at the funny explanation from Jazmine and then sneers at the not so funny second command from Jazmine. Primus had been ordered to stay inside her private bedroom for the rest of the afternoon to rest and recovery in order to finish the Accipio dream concept.

Ancient Jazmine with the gray haired buzz cut is referencing the last demon memory within Primus, which is the most powerful and important from all the demon memories during the 50 million year time span of her imprisonment inside the Demon Den by demon leader Preston.

Inside her bedroom, underneath the warmth, Primus jerks off the pile of white blankets and exposes her dirty angel uniform inside her dirty bed linens. This morning at two am, she had been too tired to eat or bathe or change her dirty clothing.

She slides off the bed mattress and stands on the hard blue colored rock floor, shaking her body, inflating her wings into 18 feet of white features with an outline of pink hue. She flutters her angel wings.

Each pair of angel wings is the magical key for an angel. Each angel feather is a tiny piece of magic that obeys his or her master. Each feather drops down and cleans Primus including her flesh and her clothing. Then some of the feathers drop down onto the bed linens, cleaning the dirtiness from the fabric.

She slowly moves ahead to the writing table and plops down on top of the blue tinted chair of hard rock, staring out an open window frame, without a glass piece. The yellow sunlight and the pink soil kiss on top of the hard mountain in beauty and pain. She tries to create a new angel sensation inside her skull for a new angel memory here on Angel Haven, but she feels both empty and numb.

When Primus thinks of an ancient angel memory at five angel years old, she feels happy. When she ponders an emotional thought of Preston, one or solo or single demon memory immediately snaps with full clarity into its proper place which is deeply hidden down inside her brain stem and away from Jazmine.

However, the rest of her demon memories with demon leader Preston have gone or vanished or been smashed or have disappeared and is longer no present inside her mind or heart or soul. Primus cannot remember or recall or reinvent one episode or incident or event from the last 50 million years with Preston. Her mental thoughts from each one of her world travels do not exist either.

The Accipio concept is awesome.

She looks down and sobs with sad tears, laying her skull on top of the writing table.

At 01:00 pm, on top of the pink tinted rock base, Teague fakes a smile and tenderly cuddles a pink tined, long, fuzzy shawl that covers the set of exposed shoulders on angel Primus while dampening that nasty demon smell. However, he's still confused about her foul demon scent on her angelic body.

For two weeks, Primus has led Teague and his team of devoted and experienced angels into each one of her past demon memories, within her mental mind. And then she has killed off the demon Priam, her other persona, within that demon particular memory. Primus has almost emptied her mental mind of each demon experience, except for one last demon memory which will terminate or murder or kill off her demon past history, sometimes this afternoon.

But, angel Primus still smells like a demon, specifically demon leader Preston as the nasty scent continues to flood into Teague's two nose holes and open mouth hole, causing his set of sensitive angel senses to revolt in a set of painful coughs, gags, and sneezes along with another angel within ten feet from Primus.

On top of the rock surface, Teague slowly strolls ahead and holds his breath, moving towards a shared pink tinted rock picnic table for a late lunch meal with his friends on the southern side inside the tiny angel village.

He and his friends are enjoying a pre-celebration event with Primus and only her current and future new angel memories, without a single demon thought, especially about Preston. And Teague and his friends are disobeying Jazmine's nasty angel order regarding Primus. Primus should be isolated from her friends and the other angels hiding her pair of contaminated demonic smelly wings from another pair of nose holes on each sweet angel. In addition she needs to be resting and recovering to kill off the very last demon memory which is the strongest and most powerful within all of her mental memories.

Teague stops at the edge of the table and nods to each one of his friends. Primus stops with a smile and sniffs the fresh fragrance of pine and cinnamon odor drifting off the tall and muscular body on Teague.

Teague had healed his physical body using his awesome angel powers from the sequences of demon fights yesterday. Now, Primus doesn't really remember any of these lost angel-demon encounters as her mind is vacant but slowly floods with each new angel experience and reveals her five year old angel memories from 50 million years ago.

He softly sniggers at the mental thought of literally vanishing demon leader Preston out from her mind while staring at each one of his friends.

Around the rock coated table, Bandy and Veck share a long rock bench without a platter of food. Scooter sits alone with an empty platter of food as he likes to eat all the time. Each angel replays with a smile from each victorious angel fight and every ugly demon defeat an array of colorful words, air-striking hands and bouncing a body off the rock chair for drama to Caiden and Jazmine, who do not enter into the Accipio dream.

Caiden and Jazmine sit together on a shared bench on the opposite side of Teague and Primus and loudly laugh at each angel victory while clapping and nodding with happiness. Teague continues to stand with Primus and listens with a smile to each entertaining story. Primus stares with puzzlement at each angel in silence.

The smooth air waves above the Angel Haven village flutter with a light breeze over the mountain peak in the bright sunlight as a noisy red and blue colored object draws closer towards the village while alerting each one of the angels with imminent danger.

On the surface, at the rock table, Scooter looks up and views a unique object in the skyline, inflating out his horse shoe patterned wings, leaping off the rock chair into the air. He flies in the sky and then lands down on the solid rock rooftop of the highest rock-coated building within the village using his angel-vision, tracking the object in sky. Veck, Bandy, and Teague swiftly lift off the ground and fly in the air, landing beside Scooter, staring at the unique object with confusion and puzzlement also.

At the rock table, Caiden flies off the rock chair and inflates his wings, hovering in the air currents, waving both of his hands, mentally telling each angel: Return back home for safety, until the item has been identified. The other angels quickly dash away from the rock garden and enter back into their assigned building or stay inside their assigned building while watching the commotion outside.

He lands and picks up Primus, escorting her towards the designated landing spot on top of the rock surface with worry and annoyance in silence.

Jazmine quickly slides off the rock table and dashes ahead towards a group of young kid angels, working with the angel instructors. They slowly scoot the kids safely back into the Tower Training building, pushing the kids into the lobby room with a set of open windows and entrance archway.

One young female kid stops and stands behind Jazmine, asking with a smile to the back spine on Jazmine. "Can we watch the plasma device now?"

"Yes." Jazmine stares through the open window at the red and blue object in the sky with confusion.

The young female kid turns and sneers at the young male kid angel. "I wanna see Bambie Poo and her dancing arms."

"I wanna to see Buggie Boo and his wiggling legs," the angel kid male wiggles both arms and laughs out loud with a grin.

Female kid angel growls at the boy, "I wanna..."

"Hush, kids!" Jazmine flips a hand in the air to the side wall and flashes her angel-magic at the second floor staircase hallway, producing three gigantic television plasma screens with a popular children's entertainment program, ordering to the kids and the instructors. "Instructors, take the kids upstairs, keep them quiet and let them watch the programs."

One of the instructors continues to stand slightly behind Jazmine and gasps in alarm, staring through the open archway at the nosily commotion outside on top of the rock garden. "Are we safe inside here? Are the children safe inside here?"

"Yes, Caiden has erected a shield inside each window pane and door archway. Nothing is getting through here or through me. Go on and get the kids upstairs and outta of my hair," she sneers with annoyance at the instructor and continues to stand in front of the open archway on the building. She pulls out one of her branch twigs and taps on the shimmering pink-tinted angel shield inside the archway that blocks her eyeball vision, staring at the unusual event. The three angel instructors slowly guide the group of kids out from the lobby room and up the tall staircase, settling them in front of the television devises that entertain their minds.

On the rooftop of the highest building, Veck stands in-between Bandy and Scooter, staring with a frown at the flying object in the skyline. "What is it?"

Scooter does not point but frowns. "I can't believe it. That's an airplane. The airplane is flying very close to our village. And the airplane is carrying a set of humans," he turns and sneers at the nose profile on Teague.

Teague stands on the opposite side of Scooter and feels his angel senses ping also, staring at the flying object over the village. "I don't believe it. A group of stupid humans have found our village. I really doubt it." He scratches his hairy skull and stares at the small buzzing airplane enlarging inside the pale blue sky.

The airplane roars with one engine whirling and twirling within the air current as the motor sputters and then spews within the atmosphere, stalling over the hidden angel mountain peak. The airplane hovers like a helicopter and then spits out a set of three large items from a side open hatchway. Each item swiftly falls down through the white clouds and pitches side to side within the sky, dropping straight down towards Angel Haven, targeting a plot blue colored rock with a single green tinted spruce tree, numerous rock coated picnic tables and matching chair for an outdoors social event with friends.

One item is colored in light green hue with a rectangular body shape. The two other items appear in bright blue hue with a circular shape, dropping in a steady line down towards Angel Haven.

On top of the building surface, Scooter, Teague, Veck, and Bandy walk backwards and drop off the edge of the rooftop together, using their angel magic, landing down on the rock surface. Each one continues to slowly move backwards from the building and tracks each object down from the skyline, strolling over the rock surface, around each pod of colorful wildflowers, each row of green tinted plant bushes and then halts in front of the rock garden with the solo tree surrounding Caiden and Primus. Each one draws out a sword that glitters in the bright sunlight waiting for the surprise attack.

Two matching blue and green colored parachutes swiftly open and continue to quietly fall at the rate of gravity towards the rock surface.

Bandy points at the skyline with her finger, not her sword tip, wearing a smile of relieve, using her angel senses. She feels joy and happiness, not angry from the humans. "Each item wears a colorful parachute. They're friendlies..."

"They're invaders," Veck sneers at the three objects and views the nose profile on Caiden, holding his sword in front of his chest for the attack. "And how do we deal with invaders, Caiden?"

Caiden continues to stare at the three descending parachutes in the sky, without his sword, using his angel telekinesis and guides the three items down into the rock garden in front of the semi-circle of warrior angels. "I'll deal with the two humans. Stow your weapons! Deflate your wings! Stand right here! Lets' see what happens next!"

The first sky diver lands down on top of the rock surface on a pair of light blue colored booted feet in a matching one-piece jumpsuit, releasing the matching parachute from his upright body. The parachute flies off with the light breeze in free flight through the air currents over the desert. His face giggles and puffs with his silly excitement and as his mind is filled with high adrenal from the high altitude skydive jump coming out from the single propped airplane. Palmer tosses his blue colored helmet down on the rock and bounces up down from the rock with excitement, settling down with a smile, slapping both of his legs with laughter. He claps with more giggles coming from the thrill-seeking ride, falling down from the heavens on the earth plane. Caiden continues to stand with the semi-circle of warrior angel and stares at the teen male human. Palmer turns and smiles at his skydiving partner, who removes her skydiving gear from her smaller frame body.

Dolly continues to stand and smiles at Priam, scanning the new environment in silence.

Primus stands in-between Caiden and Teague and gasps in alarm, dashing ahead without stopping, until she collides into her old school mates. She back steps with excitement and smiles with giggles. "Palmer! Dolly! Palmer and Dolly, you're here with me. How did you arrive here with me? You came by an airplane. Why did you arrive here by airplane, with me?" She looks up in the sky as the small airplane quickly vanishes into the western clouds.

Palmer bounces side to side with excitement, seeing his friend also. "Priam, how are you?" He turns and scans the beautiful compound with a grin. "Preston..."

Teague continues to stand on the edge of the rock garden and sneers at the male human, "Preston!"

Palmer turns and smiles at Teague. "Do you know Preston also?" Teague growls again. Palmer frowns and slaps his chest. "Who are you? Are you a friend of Priam? I'm her friend. Preston told us that you were visiting your family members here," he turns and smiles at elderly Caiden. "Is that your dad, Priam?" He turns and nods to each stranger that continues to stand in front of the rock garden, stripping off the rest of the sky diving gear, dropping it down on top of the hard rock surface with numerous tings from the metal.

Caiden continues to stand and stares at the small human male that wears a sweaty hairline. "My daughter lives here with me. I am her father. My name is Caiden. My daughter, she called you, Palmer. Is that correct, Palmer?" Palmer nods with a smile in silence. Caiden softly chuckles. "Might I inquire as to how were you told to find us here on top of a mountain peak?"

He nods. "Preston..."

Teague growls with fury, "Preston!"

Palmer turns and fakes a smile at Teague. "Yeah, Preston, he gave us some great geographical instructions. Hey, Priam! Come over here and look at this!" He reaches out and grabs the arm on Primus, shoving Dolly toward the object, leading them towards a rectangular object of aluminum metal. The aluminum metal container had been glided by Caiden behind the two humans sitting quietly on top of the rock. He releases her arm and then stops, standing behind a medium-sized object, pointing down at the top with a smile, "Priam! Look at this. We came here and brought you a container of fresh, hot sizzling pizzas for you and everyone else, too. Preston said that your parents don't allow sets of junk food for your home visit. So, we brought you two gifts, pizzas and soda." He giggles nervously.

Dolly stops and stands beside Palmer while studying each stranger with curiosity and intrigue in silence.

Primus stops in front of the container and smiles at Palmer. "Thanks for coming to visit me at my home, Palmer! How are the gang members doing there in Key West?"

He waves both of his arms in the air with his nervous teen habit and nods with a smile to Priam. "Well, everyone else, there at the military base in Florida, is busy with all of their school work, which you're missing. You're going to get the academic letter grade of F in each one of you school classes, if you don't come back to the Key West base today or tomorrow. These are the words coming from Miss R and..."

Teague moves ahead with the other angels and then surrounds Primus without extending a friendly hand to Palmer, wearing an evil grin. "You jumped from a perfectly good plane into the beautiful open skies landing right here inside an occupied village on top of a mountain. What a flying feat, huh, Palmer?" He slaps his chest with a nod. "I'm Teague, by the way. It is very nice to meet you as you are a friend of Prims."

Scooter stands in-between Veck and Teague and crosses his arms with a stern face, staring at Palmer and Dolly, "Humans..."

Caiden stands beside Primus with a fake smile. He is uncertain about hearing the first surprising answer from Palmer. "Young man, Palmer, who give you the exact directions to our mountain compound?"

Palmer turns and smiles at Caiden. "Preston, he told the pilot. Then the pilot flew us here." Teague sneers as Palmer returns back to see Teague.

Dolly slaps her chest with a smile. "My father is the top military General there on the Key West Naval Station Base and he knows the Air Force admiral. So, we hitched a ride inside a small airplane and practiced our skydiving skills. We're in-between breaks there at our local military high school." She turns and smiles at Primus. "When are you coming back, Priam? All the school teachers are asking about your person. I have all of your homework assignments also," she looks down and fiddles with a small cloth bag that is tied around her teenly waistline. "You have failed the World History project with me. I'm sorry to report. I tried to get you the letter grade of C as you did some of the investigative work. But Miss R said no," she looks up and handles a stack of folded notebook papers to Primus with a smile.

Primus accepts the bundle of papers with a nod in silence.

Scooter un-crosses his arms and points to the sky with laughter, "You are a very, very lucky human to survive that long, long drop and then that short, short landing down here on top of this mountain peak, hoss. That's way up into the skies, if you don't possess a pair of wings," he laughs with the other angels.

Primus cuddles the homework papers and smiles at her human friends. "Thanks for updating me about school and my required school activities, Dolly.""

Palmer shakes his skull with a grin. "I wasn't worried. Preston..." Teague growls in fury. Palmer nods. "Preston, he told us we could make it. I believed him."

"So, he did." Teague turns and sneers to Scooter. Scooter snorts with fury at Palmer.

Palmer continues to nod and smiles. "Preston, he was right. Preston, he is always right about everything. Priam, Preston, he sent you a gift. He said that your gift is inside the container. He won't tell me. It was a secret, only for Priam." He reaches down and pats the top of the green colored container.

Primus cringes with the set of tender words coming from her former demon boyfriend Preston within Teague's angel hearing and hears each soft growl from Teague and Caiden, exhaling with worry, spinning around to face the Training Tower building. The facility is her new home at the moment. She views Jazmine inside the open archway with a gasp.

Jazmine leads the angel instructors and a group of kid angels from the building, gliding the group towards one of the side squat blue tinted buildings for protection from the two humans. She moves ahead with a stern face.

Primus exhales with annoyance at bossy Jazmine and strolls ahead, waving her hand with a smile. "Dolly and Palmer, please, come and follow me in this direction towards the tall building. We all can eat the pizzas and chat for a while during your visit."

Palmer reaches down and shoves the container with a set of wheels ahead through the semi-circle of angels, following behind Priam, nodding with a smile. "That's great! I'm really hungry and thirsty after our journey." Dolly pedals beside Palmer while scanning the new environment in silence. Caiden, Teague, Veck, Scooter, and Bandy spin around and trail behind the two humans while spying on the teens.

Jazmine moves ahead towards Primus and then halts, blocking Primus and the two humans from the open entranceway on the building while wearing a wicked grin. "Good morning, young people! My name is Jazmine. How would you like a tour of the village while the table is set up with food, drinks, and utensils for your visit?"

"I don't require utensils, only my two hands." Palmer stands upright with a smile and wiggles his dirty finger pads in the air with laughter, greatly desiring a cold beverage for his dry throat in the mountain air.

"You're a heathen, Palmer. That's why you don't have friends." Dolly turns and laughs at Palmer.

He turns and frowns at Dolly. "I have friends." Caiden, Teague, Veck, Scooter, and Bandy halt behind the two humans and listen to the word exchange.

Dolly laughs. "Yeah, paper napkins friends." Palmer becomes embarrassed and leans down, touching the container again. She turns and scans the unfamiliar village with puzzlement and intrigue. "I would like to go and see this compound, please. What is this mountain place called? I have visited New Mexico before lots of times and never seen this peak top of the Sandia Mountains. Where are the hiking trails located up here? Or do you use a helicopter to land up here and scout out the terrain?"

Behind the semi-crooked row with the two humans and a green tinted container, Scooter leans over and whispers into the cheekbone on Teague, "How is it that the female human knows about our mountain peak?" Teague continues to stand in silence and studies each human.

Jazmine continues to smile down at the two humans. "I'll take care of this, Scooter."

Dolly continues to spy and memories the village, collecting details of the buildings, people, and plant life. "Why are you so far up into the atmosphere? I can't believe I'm not having trouble breathing in this thin mountain air. The pilot didn't believe Preston when he had explained that there was a civilization of people living up here..."

"The pilot!" Caiden gasps in shock to Jazmine.

Jazmine winks with a wicked smile to Caiden. "And I'll take care of that, also, Caiden."

Dolly scoots sideways from Jazmine and dashes ahead toward the wooden railing that surrounds the flat rock edge on the mountain peak and then stops. She leans over the steady railing with a smile and studies each plant life. "Wow! The flowers up here are beautiful. Are they wild? What kind of flora genre is that? I didn't know flowers could grow at 30,000 feet in the clouds here on the planet. Do you have other type weird flowers inside the compound?"

Jazmine reaches out and touches the arm on Palmer, nodding with a wicked grin. "Please, come this way, with me, Palmer." Palmer looks up and releases the container, standing upright, wearing a silly grin in silence. Jazmine scoots Palmer with her and advances towards the wooden railing and then stands behind Dolly. "Is your name pronounced as Dolly, human?"

Dolly stands upright and spins around, snapping at Jazmine. "My name is not that cloned sheep either. I don't appreciate any of those silly animal jokes..."

Jazmine reaches out with her free hand and touches the collar bone on a talkative Dolly. "Please, come this way, with me." Dolly quiets her words and then smiles with a silly grin at the ancient angel. Jazmine nods. "I can address all your numerous and curious questions, humans," she continues to hold her hand on each human and back steps from the railing, spinning around with a wicked grin, slowly moving ahead towards a small pink tinted building near the mountain side.

In the middle of the rock surface, behind the food containers of pizzas, Scooter follows the two humans and Jazmine, staring at each back spine with laughter. "I don't wanna be them, ever." He returns back to see the container and sniffs the air waves, smelling the fresh pizzas inside the container, wiggling his finger with angel magic on the container. The container smoothly glides over the smooth rock surface and enters the Training Tower lobby.

Veck and Teague race ahead from Scooter, Primus, Caiden and the food container with a smile and enter the lobby, staring to arrange tables, chairs, plates, and cups for an impromptu food feast.

Outdoors, on top of the rock surface, Bandy moves ahead with Caiden, Primus, and Scooter with puzzlement, viewing the mountain side. "What's going to happen to them?"

"A human always receives a mind swipe, swiping out our memories." Scooter continues to maneuver the heavy metal container towards the open archway.

Caiden turns and sneers at Scooter. "An angel doesn't call it that."

"But, that's what's it called, Caiden." He laughs.

Bandy leans over and pinches the naked bicep on Scooter with soft laugher.

Scooter laughs without pain and continues to glide the container with plumes of white steam blowing out each side into the lobby, halting a few feet from a stationary circular rock coated eating table with six matching chairs. "What's this?" He spins the container around and opens a sweaty lid as steam whirls into his eyeballs. His taste buds water for the fresh pizzas.

"Food!" Veck dashes from the table and then halts beside Scooter with a smile, staring down inside a dark hole, seeing a stack of white colored boxes. His two nose holes recognize the smell. During Curfew, the angel is allowed to travel into one of the small towns and eat a human meal first, before harassing the Demon Den of nasty demons during the evening hours until dawn.

Primus stops and stands inside the archway, spinning around, watching each one of Jazmine's feathers trail disintegrate over the smooth pink rock pathway. She frowns at her two human friends. "Strange! Dolly has never talked like that. Her personality is usually hard-edged, rude, and sarcastic."

"She's under an angel spell, Prims." Teague moves away from the table and stands beside Veck, staring down at the pizza boxes, rubbing his hands. He hears a growling stomach and as his nose holes enjoy the smell.

"The pizzas are still heated, sweltering hot." Scooter squats down and opens the bottom compartment with a smile, grabbing an assortment of cold beverages from a tiny refrigerator section located on the bottom half of the container, pitching them in the air to Bandy.

"What do you expect from a demon, an ice cream cone?" Veck continues to stand beside Scooter and stares down at the stack of pizzas, licking his lips at the food items.

Caiden stops and stands a few feet in-between the entrance door and the mysterious food container, watching for trouble in silence.

"Do you think all or one of the pizzas is toxin to our taste buds or stomach acids, Scooter?" Bandy catches each flying beverage with her angel magic and sits each one down on top of the table for consumption.

"No!" Scooter slowly stands upright after providing a cold beverage to each angel and grins down into the container.

"How do you know that fact?" Bandy frowns at Scooter.

Scooter points at his nose bridge with laughter. "My highly sensitive smell can tell when demon coodies are around my body?"

"Not so loud, Scooter!" Teague leans over and slams his fist into Scooter's bicep.

"Sorry, Teague!" Scooter frowns down at the stack of steaming and edible heated pizzas.

"No prob!" Teague looks back over his collar bone and views the back spine on Primus, who stands all alone inside the archway. Her arms hugs her body and as she continues to stare at the blue sky and white clouds.

He wonders what she is pondering within her mental mind as he can perform telepathy on an angel's mind without the last lingering demon memory giving him a mental ice cream headache.

"Too bad, I can't thank Preston in person with my sword." Scooter reaches down and grabs a stack of four pizzas with laugher, standing upright, back stepping from the container. He moves ahead towards the eating table and stops, placing the large stack of boxes in front of his chair with a smile.

Teague returns back and smiles at the back spine on Scooter, moving ahead, sitting down in an empty seat beside Scooter, "Hmm! I like that invitation. And we do know his current residential place."

"I do too." Veck squats down and grabs one of the cold beverages, slowly standing upright, shaking the liquid inside the can. He releases the tap from the can. The beverage quickly erupts out from the can with a high plume of dark liquid, hitting the air waves, dropping down over the center of the eating table. Each angel scoots around and sits down in an empty rock chair, accepting a pizza box from Scooter while laughing with fun.

Inside the doorway, Primus continues to stare at each one of the dissolving feather trail and feels happy with the brief visit from her two human friends, who really reside at the Key West military base with Preston and his band of demons. Her father Caiden had glared and growled at the two humans.

Then she feels sad. She can't ever go back to Key West Island and visit all her demon and human friends one last time, before the final loss of her single past demon memory.

At the table, Veck reaches out and grabs the last box from Scooter, laughing with fun. "Give it back!"

Scooter hugs the last unopened box from the tin. "Mine!" He scans the table and counts out loud, "One, two, three, four. The container holds five pizza boxes. Go back to the container and get the last pizza box and then stuff your face." He laughs and sits down with the box, "That's my plan."

Veck points down at the unopened box with a grin, "Are you really going to consume an entire large sized pizza by yourself, Scooter?" He plans to eat two large pizzas.

Bandy thumbs back over her collar bone at the container and opens the lid, "Veck, there are plenty of extra large piping hot pizzas to go around..."

"... with nice compliments from Preston, the demon guy," Scooter laughs and slams the lid open, revealing the steaming food, grabbing one slice. He lifts the slice in the air and moves towards his wiggling tongue as tomato sauce drips on the table and the floor.

"Stop!" Bandy gasps in alarm and stares down at her pizza.

Scooter halts his hand as the hot sauce drapes his hand and then hits the clean floor. He turns and frowns at Bandy. "Go and get your own pizza box, Bandy!"

"No! I have a pizza box." She points down at her pizza. "Look at this! Is that a word on the top of the crust?" She shuffles the box sideways for a better view and then reads out loud. "I see the capital letter D here on top of this pizza. This is so odd!"

Scooter looks down at his pizza and smiles. "Yeah, there's a word written here on this pizza also. It spells in big red colored letters, S. C. O.O. T. E. R, which is my name, Scooter." He slowly guides the hot slice toward into his open mouth.

Bandy points at Scooter. "No! Don't eat that yet, Scooter!"

Veck reaches down and pulls out the last pizza box, opening the lid, gasping in alarm. "Hold up, Scooter! There seems to be something on top of this pizza also." The last pizza adds to the mystery.

Scooter looks at the rapidly cooling pizza turning cold stone in his hands. "Yeah, the something is yellow cheese, white crust, and red..."

"Letters! This pizza clearly displays three distinct letters, spelling out ...A.L.L. Each letter is written in blood red colored tomato sauce over the heavy yellow cheese." Veck looks up and frowns at Scooter. Scooter turns and frowns to Teague. Teague looks up and frowns at Scooter.

Scooter continues to hold the single slice of pizza and looks back over his collar bone, viewing Caiden with confusion. "Does the word, all, mean something to an angel, Caiden?"

Bandy closes the box lid and gasps in alarm, pointing down at the lid with shock. "Hey! Look out! There is a printed math number on top of my pizza box. Do you see the printed math number? The printed math number displays the mathematical symbol five," she looks up and frowns at Veck. "Why is there a math number on top of the pizza box?"

Scooter lowers the good-smelling pizza slice back down into the box and flips lid over the hot food, seeing a mathematical symbol three, laughing out loud. "I got the math number of three. I've never heard of eating pizzas, in order. Why would we do that? Is each pizza made of double cheese with thick tomato sauce?" He flips open the lid and stares down at the pizza, gasping in shock. "Hey. I see something on top of the pizza too. This symbol kinda forms a word in big letters that paints in thick red tomato sauce. I see the word, OR."

Teague back steps from the table and holds his box of pizza, dashing around the table and the container, collecting every pizza box in a stack, moving back to the rock table. He slowly places each box in numeric order on top of the hard surface, exhaling with puzzlement. Each angel back steps from the table and row of pizza boxes, nodding in silence to Teague. Teague reaches down and flips open the first box, staring with the mathematically number one, slowly moving down the row, repeating the same maneuver. Inside each box, every circular pizza contains a flat set of red colored tomato sauce decorated alphabetic letters that form a single word on top of the yellow cheese.

Each angel gasps in shock as Teague back steps and stands in the angel line, sneering at the hidden secret message within the five cheese pizzas, "Return. Her. Or. All. Die. Preston."

"Are we certain of the subject matter?" Jazmine appears inside the archway and smiles at Primus.

"Primus!" Teague spins around and shouts out loud with worry, staring at his girl.

Inside the Training Tower building, angel Primus stares down at the blue tinted rock floor and mentally ponders. Her mind feels like a bowl of dessert pudding. She wears her new white tinted battle uniform that covers her throat down to each toenails sitting quietly on top of the bed linens inside her room. Her two kneecaps are plowed into her chest. Her arms are parked around the two kneecaps, keeping them warm as the sun rays blister her bedspread and then dance across the empty floor ricocheting off her inflated wings, warming them on her back muscles as her wings bounce gently up and down like rocking a baby, decorating with thick rounded pink circles sprinkled over the wing surface like a fabric design of dotted Swiss and within each circle, there are three tones of pink as the inner most dark pink spot surrounds a medium hot pink tone edged in baby candy pink.

Primus switches her mental gears and thinks of Preston while living inside one of the many Demon Dens. However, her mind is blank. She has lost all of her past demon memories. She can't recreate one social or special event inside one of the Demon Den, which is still located somewhere within. She exhales with regret. Accipio concept is good.

Primus looks up to see the ceiling, then the floor and then finally the archway, seeing nothing. She hears and feels nothing. The Accipio concept is very good.

She hasn't had the enough free time to select any functional or funny, wooden or stone curved furnishings for her second floor bedroom. The room remains empty, except for the flat wooden frame bed that stands four inches up from the floor, holding a soft and conforming king-sized mattress for her body and her wings. The row of window panes stand on three sides inside the room blind her eyeballs during sunrise and then at sunset here inside the building.

The training facility appears within a pair of human eyeballs as a glossy photograph coming straight from a world history textbook much similar to a real circular "Keep of Windsor Castle" which is geographically located on the Thames River in the country of European England, constructed in 1080 AD.

Primus mentally believes in her heart, not her blank mind that she had lived with Preston in an ancient royal castle too.

On top of the bed linens, she exhales with annoyance and as her emotions know that she had lived in other places, inside other buildings, within other cities along with Preston. Her current memories are gone like Primus never existed in past or present, which is the nasty after effect from the Accipio concept. She had been told over and over by Jazmine her real angel memories will emerge and then re-load back into her brain cells, once all the demon memories were gone like the cold mountain breeze here on Sandia.

She exhales with sadness. She shakes her brown curls with worry, until both of her two eyeballs and all her numerous brain cells become dizzy without a mental thought. Her current angel life isn't fair. She has lost each one of her demon memories, since the age of five angel years old.

At five years old, she met Preston, the other demons, and then lived throughout world while making past history, which were printed in books throughout the centuries. However, nothing has changed within her heart.

Once the Accipio concept has finished with shared the Un-learneth concept, she will become a new innocent angel within the flock of old angels and her last demon memory will be gone too.

She exhales with sadness and then laughs out loud with glee.

Two demon memories still remain within her memory. One demon memory was her capture by angel Teague there at the Key West military base. She giggles and shakes her brown curls. That is not the right word. She had been rescued by angel Teague there at the Key West military base from the demons and Preston.

She exhales with happiness.

The second demon memory is embedded, very deeply, down into her mind, her heart, and her soul.

Primus looks up and stares out the windows bouncing with the waves of heat and light dancing on the glass like tiny sparkling ballerinas as her active mind strategically switches gears to the gathered, collected, and learned Angel Battle data since yesterday, consisting of new sword moves, new first aid for wings, new wing protection and killing maneuvers for terminating mean Demons as she sighs then breathes, sadly.

She yawns ugly and rubs both of her eyelids. She had stayed awake past midnight while studying and learning about the angel compound and angel defensive techniques for staying alive and breathing as a fighting angel. Primus doesn't know how to fight against an opponent, especially an evil angry and killing demon. She has never been required to fight including verbally or figuratively or physically, since Preston has protected her. Well, she does believe so. That demon memory tag hasn't been blown away by Accipio concept.

Her mind drifts back to the upcoming war plans as an angel eyeball view of the Angel Haven on top of the mountain peak inside the Sangre de Cristo Mountain Range swiftly pops into her mental mind.

The Sangre De Cristo Mountain range represents the southernmost sub-range of the Rocky Mountains, which are located in the southern portion of US State Colorado and the northern site of US State New Mexico within the United States of America. The mountain range trends southeast and south down into the human city of Santa Fe, New Mexico. Some of the Colorado mountain peaks rise up towards 14,000 feet in the skyline with 13,000 feet among the New Mexico peaks that tickle the clouds.

The name Sangre de Cristo references the reddish hue during sunrise and sunset even when each high mountain peak is covered in white tinted snowflakes and had been named, in the year 1719, by the Spanish explorer Antonio Valverde y Cosio. The Spanish string of words translates into "Blood of Christ."

The mountain range appears like a set of pointy bumps going up and down on top of the earth plain.

The Sangre de Cristo range is a fault-block mountain. A set of major fault lines runs east and west along the side of the mountain cutting through the range plain. The range lacks a set of flat foothills on top of the soil and displays numerous 7,000 feet tall high peaks that rise up from the valley floor while moving eastern towards western. This mountain range had been pushed upwards around five million years ago as one large mass of rock.

Today, the Sangre De Cristo mountain range still uplifts as the major fault lines remain active within the perimeters.

Inside her bedroom, on top of the mattress, she gasps in alarm. The bed mattress slowly shuffles side to side on top of the hard rock like angel magic. She laughs out loud with amusement. The mountain peak had experienced a tiny active fault line that didn't cause any damage, only mental alert.

Her father Caiden is a wise angel.

Currently, the war between the angels and the demons is occurring on the top crests of the Sandia Mountain Range. The Sandia Mountain range is part of a single geologic unit within the Sandia-Manzano Mountain Range. The two ranges are separated by the Tijeras Canyon of green tinted fir and spruce trees, rows of plant bushes, and herds of gray colored deer. The canyon floor houses the historical US Route 66 highway for humans and their driving vehicles.

Within the Sandia Mountain range, the landmass displays 17 miles distance within a single northern towards southern ridge that rises into two separate mountain peaks, the Sandia Crest at 10,678 feet high and the South Sandia Peak at 9,702 feet high, not touching the cloud cover, unlike the Sangre de Cristo peaks. The width of the range measures eight miles across. The west side of the mountain range is steep and rugged with sheer rock walls near the Sandia Crest. The eastern side displays a gently slope.

The word, Sandia, translates into the silly word of watermelon in the Spanish language by the invading Spanish army while exploring the new terrain. The name references a reddish color of top of the mountain peak at sunset along with a long ridge of green colored savanna wilderness consisting of desert grassland, fir, evergreen, and spruce trees, squash gourds, and patches of lovely marigold flowers at the bottom of mountain range, such like, the green tinted rind of a watermelon.

The Sandia Mountain Range had been uplifted ten million years ago and formed part of the Rio Grande Rift. The core within each mountain consists of granite, which is 1.5 billion years old. The mountain peaks contains limestone rock, where numerous forms of marine fossils rest in death including crinoids, brachiopods, gastropods, horn corals, and bryozoans, which are too small for a human eyeball to detect, but not an angel eyeball.

The granite on and in the mountain is embedded with numerous potassium-feldspar crystals that make each peaks glow in pink hue underneath the clouds.

The highest geographical peak of Sandia Crest is 10,678 feet in the air. But the mountain height does not stop a human or a pack of humans from traversing the mountain peak by a rolling car or a speeding motorcycle or a zooming tramcar or a flying hang glider. The tall crest also houses numerous human facilities with food booths and shops with gift items for their non-vacationing family members. The floor on the wilderness displays human foot trails, bicycle pathways, picnic tables, and ski resorts during the winter months.

Even the western side on the Sandia Mountain Range displays a sloping sheer wall of hard rock, where a human will engage in boulder-jumping or rope-climbing while endangering their delicate body of flesh and bones.

On top of the bed mattress, Primus shakes her curls and ponders the motive of a human. The group of humans, even visiting the Sandia Crest today during the warm summer weather, will never see a flying angel or a fighting demon in the skies or on the soil.

Her father Caiden is a very smart angel.

At the mountain range, angel leader Caiden has concentrated the flock of warrior angels at the lower peak of 9,702 feet on the Sandia South Peak, which is not used by the group of nosy humans that tromp over Mother Nature's home and currently where the flock of warrior angels hides inside the grove of evergreen trees waiting for the enemy.

Primus cannot venture out from her bedroom to witness the war, but she does possess shared knowledge of the war strategy during the war planning meeting last night shaking her curls with worry.

The 9,702 feet mountain peak on the Sandia Mountain Range is a natural concentric circle for any defensive protection against any natural or un-natural enemy, much like, an ancient medieval castle from 11th century Europe, since angel Scooter enjoys updating every pair of eardrums on every angel around his person, all the time.

The importance of any defense plan starts with the landscape as she shakes her curls and analyzes the war plan using her limited knowledge of the land and sky elements. Currently, the powerful Accipio concept had blown away all her past demon memories, but she still believed that the pod of demons also had talked about warfare with the angels too.

The first problem of offense there at Sandia Sand Peak is sloped on each side on the tall mountain range that lends itself to a demon attack strategy with an uphill climb for an advantageous kill shot at each exposed angel that lives underneath an open sky and open landscape, since the command center is exposed there on top of a naturally formed flat surface.

However, a demon will not care.

Each demon possesses a pair of red tinted claws to crawl in the pink dirt, up the hill, and then dump upright a bad stinky body in the middle of the rock surface in order to harm and hurt every kid, teen, young, and mature angel.

The second problem is the thick and healthy grove of green tinted evergreen, fir, and spruce trees covering the other sloped side.

However, a demon will not care.

A demon can climb up each tall tree and then shoot off the sturdy tree trunk with a gliding pair of red tinted wings, landing down inside the command center in order to harm and hurt every angel.

The third problem is the formation of the twin devil-horned crests on the edge of the north-south mountain ridge in-between the Sandia Mountains which can fill with sheet of heavy raindrops inside an empty cradle with deep water.

However, a demon will not care.

A demon can fly through the air currents or swim underneath the water with a surprise attack inside the command center in order to harm and hurt each angel.

The fourth problem, there is not a single outer wall protection around the command center consisting of naturally forming granite rock walls in pink hue for observing a wandering animal or a flying bird or a fighting demon.

However, a demon will not care.

A demon will land inside the angel command center and kill an exposed angel among the bright sunlight and cool mountain breeze.

The fifth problem, there is not an inner wall to retreat from the angel command center while still maintaining a proper defense stance and treatment center for each wounded angel.

However, a demon will not care.

The last and worse problem with the angel offense strategy, each building here at the Angel Haven contains an open archway or window pane, where Primus currently lives on the northern part of the mountain peak that descends down towards the valley dirt, desert, and plants.

However, a demon will not care.

A demon will enter the open archway and kill each angel child and then Primus.

Late last night, each visual and vocal strategic war problem had been debated, argued, disputed, deliberated, questioned, and contested, until Primus had fallen asleep on top of her crossed arms, drooling wet spit from one side of her mouth, there in her assigned seat, onto a collection of old materials, photographs, manuals, scrolls, and letters inside the upper balcony, left side in the auditorium. Her father Caiden had conducted the war battle session with every angel but the group of younger angel kids and tiny angel babies.

Currently, on top of her bed mattress, inside her bedroom, Primus realizes without consulting with either Caiden or Teague the proposed un-tested war battle strategy allows a demon army to act with no difficulty in taking and then capturing the hidden angel command center inside the Sandia Sand Peak.

"No mercy!" She exhales with deep worry.

Her penthouse floor inside the Training Tower provides beauty and is a prime target for any demon including Preston, since the tower building cannot be defended like an Earth king's castle with an array of firing sharp arrows or hurling sharp projectiles from each advancing attacker that will cause harm and then death.

Primus had tried to verbalize her brilliant angel battle idea to Teague regarding the exposed and unprotected Angel Haven.

However, Teague had agreed with Caiden that the pod of demons will automatically fly towards the flock of warrior angels while passing the angel nursery without a single evil thought.

So, Preston had clearly declared a silent war against all the faithful angels living on Angel Haven, if Primus was not returned back to him while sending out that deadly message inside a set of hand delivered pizza boxes by two teen humans which was written in blood red colored tomato sauce on top of each extra-large double cheese pizzas.

The tomato sauce group of messages had read: **Return. Her. Or. All. Die. Preston.**

So, demon prince Preston had personally autographed his threat, intent, and name at each faithful angel with his angry and frustration, regarding his girlfriend angel Primus.

On top of the bed linens, Primus feels deeply shocked, stunned, surprised, happy, sad, upset, impressed, flattered, and confused all at the same time, since yesterday afternoon. She shakes her curls with worry.

Yesterday, her father Caiden had blasted the row of heated pizzas into an individual pile of red and yellow ashes, refusing the ransom note, calling for the war with the fallen angels.

On top of the messy bed linens, Primus exhales with worry and whispers for her eardrums only, "What a mess!"

At 06:06 am, in front of her archway, a set of loud knocks hit the solid rock frame using his angel magic as a rock does not make a sound with a flesh and bone fist format. Primus is quickly startled into reality coming from her daydream and looks up at the archway, seeing a smiling Teague.

Teague wears a head of black tinted shoulder length and displays a new white tinted, clean uniform, representing a warrior angel, standing six feet and six inches in height with a set of ripped muscles outlining his white tee shirt underneath the sleeveless vest.

She smiles at her angel boyfriend.

His angel uniform consists of a long-sleeved tee shirt underneath a sleeveless vest with a pair of white tinted leather pants that are tucked down into his infamous white scuffed cowboy boots.

Primus had recalled seeing those cowboy boots from her first encounter there behind a Florida scrub bush.

Teague appears happy with a pair of teal-blue eyeballs directly at Primus. He wears a rose-beige tinted skin with a jaw line of dusted black colored whiskers and as both arms appears akimbo. His inflated wings measure 22 feet with strips of bright gold and electric blue vertical line alternating patterns on each feather. The wing tips are outlined in golden hue. He smiles and then coughs, sneezing out loud, wiping his wet mouth with the back of his hand and then smiles again Primus. He claps with a laugh, "Let's go! The war meeting starts in fifteen minutes. I don't wanna be late for the happy historical event, Prims." Teague nods with a grin and as his pair of inflated wings bounce side to side, extending his arm with an index finger to her.

She leaps up from the bed linens in the air and flutters her pair of pink tinted angel wings through the air waves. A set of dead feathers gently tumble down and then land on top of the floor before Primus, dissolving into a pile of pink ashes and then nothingness. She slowly lowers down and stands on top of the rock floor with a smile.

He violently coughs out loud and covers his wet mouth with his hand, nosily clearing his tight throat, sneezing out the nasty demon germs in a series of loud huffs of breathe, wiping off his wet nose holes also. She tenses with realization. Teague yells out loud without removing his hand. "Hey!" He gags and then swallows the clear mucus snot back down his throat, waving a free hand sideways through the air currents. "Can you tuck your wings down inside your body, for me, Prims?" Her demon smell annoys his angel senses. He turns to face the wall and coughs out loud and then sneezes, clearing a wet throat, wiping off the wet mucus from his face.

Primus continues to stand and stares at the nose profile on Teague in disbelief. Both Scooter and Veck also continue to cough, sneeze, and then recover similar to Preston, Caiden, Jazmine, and Bandy while outside in the cold mountain air and inside the warm interior walls in the presence of her person or her wings or her body.

Now, Primus finally understands with sadness. She does not belong here on Angel Haven as her body still smells like a demon, even after the rough Accipio process. And her mind holds one more hidden and secret demon memory, where the Un-learneth concept has not erased. However, sweet angel Teague tries very lovingly to make the days and nights welcoming for her here at the angel village.

"O yeah. Okay." She fakes a smile and deflates her wings, storing them back down inside her back spine in the formation of two pinky fingers, reaching back and grabs the pretty body shawl. She swings the shawl in the air and places around her naked collar bone, wrapping the cloth around her body, faking a smile at Teague.

Teague returns back and smiles at Primus, extending an arm again with his index finger, slowly back stepping from the open archway into the hallway without touching her.

She slowly moves ahead and enters an empty hallway, turning to face the staircase, extending her arm with her index finger towards Teague, wearing a fake smile.

Each finger gently touching the other as they both they slowly walk ahead over the hard, down the stairwell, through an empty lobby floor, and into the bright light like they are a paired brother and sister going to church.

"Wow! Today is a great day for the war battle between the angels and the demons," he continues to stroll towards the large auditorium building and smiles with the light war chat using an angel whisper into her eardrums.

She turns and stares at each jagged rock edge underneath the single chopped down tree log on the mountain peak surface, wearing a sad face. "Yeah, I guess so."

"We're going to win this war, Prims. Then I'll be free of Preston, finally and foreverly," He bounces up and down over the hard surface with evil laughter, scanning the pale blue sky for a visual sign from the demon leader, since the deadly threat has been made. Each angel is ready, because the war is coming soonest and Teague is happiest.

No one knows the actual arrival time with the pod of nasty demons, maybe it is today or tonight or in-between the day and night. Caiden had refused the ransom demand with Preston for Primus. So, every angel is prepared for upcoming bloody battle and displays a battle uniform carrying a battle sword.

She continues to scan the pretty and spare natural landscape with a sad face, "Yeah, I guess so."

A red tinted long ponytail, a tone of white tinted skin, a pair of violet colored eyes and a pair of pink colored lips appears on a male angel that stands six feet and seven inches tall in height that displays a pair of gigantic 23 foot neon orange colored wings. The inner feathers on the orange tinted background decorates in individual shapes of horse shoes where the symbol is used by a horse that walks on four hoofs living on the ranches and farms throughout the countryside. Each horse shoe symbol appears upright, downside, and sideways going to the left and then to the right in solid hues of black, red, dark blue, dark green, and deep purple hues. His wingtips are outlined in dark purple color. Scooter wears a new white tinted battle uniform like Preston, a long-sleeved tee shirt, a sleeveless vest, a pair of leather pants which goes down into a pair of polished white tinted cowboy boots.

From behind the strolling couple, angel Scooter races ahead with a smile and collides into the back spine on Teague. Teague stumbles into Primus and hugs her body, spinning around in a couple of circle, moving ahead towards the railing and then halts, coughing out loud and then sneezes. He quickly separates from Primus and then back steps, gagging on his mouth spit and nose mucus, coughing out loud again, wiping off the wet mucus from his dirty face.

Scooter stands in place and dances side to side with laughter, jabbing a finger at Teague. "That's called a demon rear end assault, hoss."

"You're too low, worm!" Teague looks up and views Scooter, striking the air waves with a pair of folded fists for fun laughter with Scooter. They lean over and perform a fist-bump, rolling both arms in the air with more laughter, wiggling a silly dance over the hard rock.

A bald male in a set of matching white tinted angel gear displays a tone of yellow tinted skin, a pair of intense light green eyeballs and a light brown goatee. He measures six feet and five inches tall in height and displays a pair of expanded wings of 21 feet. His feathers are imprinted symbols of arrowheads made of brown and beige hue which are mingled inside a horizontal layer of light green, bright yellow, and fire engine. A dull orange tint outlines each wing tip. He holds the hand on his girl Bandy and leans over with a smile and whispers into her face while staring at the back spine on Primus.

Veck releases Bandy and races ahead with a chuckle and collides into Scooter, who then slams back into Teague. Scooter and Teague hug each other and stop their backwards motion. Veck pulls out his sword and points the sharp glittering tip at Teague and then Scooter, laughing with humor. "Do you like my dual demon battle attack, bro?"

Bandy stops her pace and laughs at the funny event. She measures five feet and four inches in height with a pair of 18 foot rainbow tinted angel wings. Her wing tips are outlined in a rose tint. Her feathers appear in vertical lines of alternating rainbow colors of light green, pink, pale yellow, and lavender against the wall of her wings. She possesses a head of short auburn colored hair with a thick strand of blonde hair that is slowly growing back from the fight with the demon female. She displays a pair of dark green eyes on her face of beige colored skin, wearing a matching white colored battle uniform also.

Teague reaches out and shoves Veck from his face, yelling with annoyance. "Stop goofing off, Veck!"

"I can't help my angel self. I'm too keyed up to for the final demon flight and then angel fight," Veck dances side to side with laughter, blocking Teague's progress.

"Yeah, I feel the same way. I'm too keyed up to die in the angel fight." Primus continues to stand a few feet from the single railing and stares at Veck, whispering for her eardrums only.

Scooter turns and winks at Primus with laughter. "We don't die, do we, Veck?" He leans over and performs a fist bump with his friends, returning back, leading the angels into the auditorium archway. Teague and Primus spin around and stroll ahead together.

Veck points with a smile at Scooter. "I won't, but he might." Each angel but Primus laughs out loud with humor and then enters through the open archway.

At 06:33 am, inside the auditorium building within the dance hall location, the war meeting is located inside the dance hall, a place of happy dance steps and joyful songs. Each battle age warrior leans against one of the three solid blue tinted walls or sits down on top of the rock coated floor while staring at the podium without the angel leader.

Scooter slowly passes down a semi-crooked aisle of sitting angels and performs a hand slap on each collar bone or an upright palm with a smile of evil laughter, moving ahead towards the front row, sitting down in the middle of the row.

Teague slowly moves down the same semi-crooked aisle of sitting angels and performs a hand slap also without carrying his sword. Primus follows the inflated wings on Teague without performing a hand slap on each sitting angel. Teague continues ahead and passes the front row, leading behind Veck and Bandy with Scooter, pointing at the balcony with a smile. He heads toward a side staircase, "Follow me! Come this way, Prims!"

On every building, each archway does not contain a doorway and display a wide rectangular space with a smoothly arched entranceway, so each young angel kid doesn't snag their precious soft feathers into the solid rock frames. Each angel walks around with a pair of inflated wings for balance and cleans off the dead feathers.

Primus races ahead and pulls up beside Teague with a smile. "We can both fly faster on a pair of wings going upwards toward the balcony, honey. I'll race you to the top, Teague." She rolls one collar bone as her pink shawl slips away from her neck.

His boot toe hits the first rock step and as Teague coughs out loud and then performs numerous loud sneezes in a row, covering his nostrils and mouth with his free hand, spinning around to view Primus. Her shawl had slipped off one of her collar bones and exposed her naked skin. He reaches out and grabs the shawl, covering her naked skin, coughing out loud and then sneezes in a row. He wipes off his wet nose with the back of his hand. "Easy there, Prims! I don't want you getting hurt, again. You got one more Accipio dream and then you will be completely healed. Can you please put your shawl back over your exposed skin, okay?" He jerks his hand back from the shawl and then turns to face the rock wall, coughing out loud, sneezing several times. He recovers quickly and then nosily clears the throat, turning to smile at her.

"Okay." She wraps her body with the shawl.

He swings back around and slowly climbs the staircase, coughing out loud, wiping his face with the back of his wet hand.

They rapidly advance towards the upper balcony space and then occupy a lonely rock coated chair for each one.

Primus exhales with annoyance and views a tall figure six feet and eight inches in height with a wing span of 24 feet in the air, displaying a pair of greenish-blue eyeballs.

On top of the auditorium floor, inside the open archway, Caiden leads Jazmine through the entranceway and slowly strolls down the same semi-crooked aisle while gesturing to some of the angels and then halts. Jazmine stops beside Caiden. He leans over with a smile and whispers a set of sweet words into her cheekbone, standing upright with a smile, moving ahead and then stops, standing front of the audience of angels. Each one of his angel wings possesses purple solid color that rise high above his skull bone from each wing arch and then descends down to his kneecaps. Gold hue crosses at his waist and descends down to the bottom wing tip on left side with the black and turquoise feathers on the right side. Caiden stands tall without a rounded belly and a jaw line of white tinted whiskers on his pale colored face, two rosy pink cheekbones, a pair of pink tinted lips and, a head of white curly hair.

Jazmine scoots sideways and then sits down in-between Scooter and Veck. She measures five feet and six inches in height with a pair of 19 feet wing span that is outlined in soft yellow hue around each wing tip. Her feathers are embedded with an array of medium-shaped, horizontal, raindrop-designs on the front and the back. Each raindrop glitters in the rainbow colors consisting of purple, red, blue, green, and orange. Her bone skull wears dark red hair and a tone of pink skin tone. She sits in a cross-legged post and places her medicine bag in-between her legs, staring with a stern face at Caiden.

In front of the audience, Caiden claps his hand and nods in silence as each warrior angel calms the noise level down to a soft whisper. He nods with a smile. "We, the faithful angels have been challenged. We, the faithful angels will rise to meet the demon challenge. We, the faithful angels will fight the demon challenge here on Angel Haven." The audience of angels swiftly stands and then bounces around while loudly clapping and cheering with the war speech.

Inside the balcony, Primus continues to sit on top of the hard rock chair and rolls her eyeballs, returning back to view the audience of silly angels in silence.

On the front row, Jazmine stands upright from the floor along with Scooter, Veck, and Bandy and then spins around, waving both of her arms in the air with a wicked smile to the rowdy angels. "Here! Here!" She shouts out loud and wears her true warrior's heart, soul, and attitude. Caiden chuckles at the action remark.

The angel chant loudly echoes off each wall inside the room, "Here! Here! Here..."

Inside the balcony, Primus turns and frowns at Teague, "Why we are sitting so far away from the audience of other angels, Teague? I wanna be part of the cheering audience." She knows the answer to her question but secretively desires to frustrate Teague, wondering if he will ever reveal the truth about her demon possessed body and her smelly demon wings.

Teague stares down at the audience with a smile and greatly desires to sit inside the audience of cheering angels also. "Caiden, your father ordered you to sit up here with me to see the action, Prims." His mind echoes the fiery war speech as his wings and body flashy movements and words about upcoming war with the demons.

She stands and leans over the rock coated balcony railing in silence.

He frowns with annoyance and stares at her back spine, "Be careful there, Prims! You don't want to fall over the railing and down into the audience of angels."

"I'm a swift flier and a graceful angel, too." She smiles down at the audience with a heart of an angel or maybe a demon. "I should land down and stand beside my father, the leader. After all, I am his long, lost daughter."

He stares into the audience while longing to be down there. "No! That's not good idea. You...you might get hurt again."

She scans some of the colorful inflated wings on each angel that glitters in the air. "I can't see anything from this height."

"We are obeying Caiden's order, Prims." He studies the galley of angels while wishing to be down inside the crowd of swaying and pushing wings and bodies during the war speech.

She leans over more and smiles down at the audience, "Nonsense! This fight, this war is about me."

"No! This war is about Preston and his nasty pod of demons. We have been waiting ages for this day to finish off the fallen ones..."

She turns and frowns at Teague. "Wait! You told me that you were ten angel years old at that time. How do you happen to fight in the Battle of Eden, Teague?"

He continues to stare into the audience. "O yeah! They called in all the battle recruits."

"You were ten years old. Even in angel years that's very young. I don't understand your statement, Teague."

"Well, I was...I wasn't in much with my hand-to-hand combat, Prims. I was the flute player. You know, I was like a drum player that played the drums during the historical Civil War Between the US States here on Planet Earth."

She frowns. "Why was the pizza note addressed to me?"

He shrugs his shoulder and continues to stare down into the audience. "I told you before. Preston doesn't know anyone else, but you. You were his demon prisoner for many, many angel years."

She gasps, "Does Preston know you name..."

"... and my angel reputation along with that spoken name? Yeah, he does," he laughs.

She frowns. "Why didn't you get a note too? You're more of a threat to Preston rather than me."

He rubs his neck muscles with frustration when Primus asks a direct question that he shouldn't address as he has been ordered by Caiden. "Prims, that note inside each wet pizza was a ruse to rally the celestial rebellion. That's all. You're reading too much into the war event. That's all. War was coming with the demons and the angels. No one knew the precise date and time. But, now, today, we know."

She returns back and views the audience of angels. "O! I'm sorry. I always seem to read too much into every little event. I am still shocked about the pizza note and the two humans that were delivery directly here on top of Angel Haven."

The audience of angel continues to chant out loud, "Here! Here! Here ..."

"Yeah, you won't the only angel stunned with that unprecedented and historical fact that had occurred here yesterday on Angel Haven." He laughs and ponders beating black and blue Preston upon arrival here for that stupid demon decision.

On top of the auditorium floor, Jazmine continues to stand and waves her arms. "Angels, we are splitting into smaller sections. I will instruct all the senior angels here inside the auditorium with a more civilized discussion of demon dis-wingment. Please get up and follow your assigned squad leader! Please stay in a calm walking order! No flying allowed inside or outside!"

Inside the balcony, Teague stands from the rock chair and approaches Primus, stopping and stands beside her. He leans over and whispers into her cheekbone, "Time for you to go! You are not allowed to fight against Preston or any of his demons..."

"I know that."

He nods with a smile. "Good! You know that you need to go and stay inside your room inside the Training Tower during the war."

"Yeah, I know that, too!"

"All right!" He leans over and hugs her body, without kissing her cheekbone, and receiving an ice cream headache. Her last demon memory is still strong and causes his mental mind to swirl and twirl in a set of dizzy circles. He pulls back with a smile and swings Primus around to face an open window, pointing at the blue sky. "You can exit this way through the open archway and fly back towards your room."

"Okay!" She drops the shawl down from her body with a smile of soft laughter. He starts to immediately cough and then sneeze several times, spitting out a tongue of salvia spit down on the floor. Primus inflates her wings and dashes away from Teague, exiting the wide archway without damaging her wing tips.

Inside the balcony space, Teague spins around from Primus and dashes back down the staircase, coughing wildly, sneezing loudly while cleaning out his clogged sinuses. He races ahead and sits down in-between his friends Scooter and Veck on the front row.

Outside within the fresh mountain air, Primus continues to soar through the air like a bird and flies around in loose circles, before returning back into her private suite, giggling with amusement.

Inside the auditorium, rows of angels stand and then leave the auditorium setting, disappearing outside, moving into a smaller building with cheers and claps for the upcoming celestial war.

At 07:10 am, the atmosphere turns quiet inside the auditorium, without Primus, Jazmine slowly back steps from the front row and then halts, standing against the solid wall, viewing each angel face. She takes a deep breath. "The term skin is a covering on a small animal, such like, sheep, goats..."

"Goat skin!" Scooter wiggles on top of the floor and bumps into Teague, shouting out loud with fun.

Jazmine frowns down at Scooter, "Pigs."

"Pig skin!" Veck laughs out loud and elbows Teague.

"Oink!" Scooter laughs. Veck and Teague snigger with the other angels.

Jazmine nods, "Snakes."

"Snake skin!" Scooter yells with a smile.

She nods. "The term hide or rawhide is the covering of a large adult animal, cow, buffalo, or horse."

"What! Don't you have a comeback, Scooter?" Teague turns and smiles at Scooter.

Veck smiles. "Scooter, he got a set of raw hidden emotions."

Bandy leans over and frowns at the three angels. "Pay attention!" She sits back and stares with a stern face at Jazmine.

Jazmine continues. "Skins and hides come from a different animal which is used by humans for clothing, hand bags and other human products in the form of leather..."

Scooter teases. "I want a new set of leather luggage, demon designer brand, ya'll!" He laughs with the other angels.

Jazmine nods with a stern face. "The skin from a goat or a cow is used to make parchment for paper."

"Demon stationary, ya'll!" Scooter laughs with the other angels.

Veck shouts out loud with laughter. "This is the next hot item for sale next week."

Teague laughs. "The price is..."

"....three dollars and ninety-nine cents with tax and shipping, ya'll!" Veck chuckles.

"....and delivered to your front door step by me..." Scooter swiftly stands and spins around, slapping his chest with the clapping audience of angels. He swings back around and bows to Jazmine, slowly sitting back down, elbowing Teague and his angel friends with laughter.

Jazmine allows the noise to cease then frowns. "Young animal skin can be cooked to make pork rind..."

"Demon potato chips!" Scooter stands again and spins around, waving both arms in the air.

Veck swiftly stands and spins around to face the audience. "For sale..."

"...starting tomorrow evening," Teague stands and faces the audience, laughing with the other angels.

"So, come and get free samples here at the dance!" Scooter laughs.

"Boo-wah!" One warrior female angel stands and shouts out loud.

"Me, first!" A second male warrior angel stands and yells out loud.

"No way!" A third female warrior angel stands and screams out loud.

"Yuck-o!" A fourth female warrior angel sits and hollers out loud.

"Sit down, angels!" Jazmine frowns. Each angel sits down and faces Jazmine. She exhales with confidence. "A demon possesses a set raw-hide skin as seen by a pair of angel eyeballs looking like a piece of reptile scales. The under skin on the demon wing is very hard and thick, much similar, to dried leather from a dead cow."

Scooter quickly stands and waves both arms in the air, shouting out loud. "Moo! Moo! Moo..."

A plume of invisible pressurized hot air hits Scooter's chest like a slag hammer as he stumbles backwards from his upright pose. Teague stands upright from the floor and catches the arm on Scooter while stopping a body collision with more sitting angels on the second row. Scooter halts his folded movement and heaves out gulfs of sour air from his tight lungs.

In front of the forward wall, Jazmine had flung out her hand with forced air at Scooter for misbehaving. She sneers at the senior angel. "Sit back down and be quiet, Scooter!"

Scooter slowly bends down and sits back down in his spot beside Teague, exhaling with heavy breathes of slight pain.

She exhales with annoyance. "Some of the demon wings resemble a reptile or an ocean fish that naturally displays a set of hard protective scales. The pair of wings provides a strong barrier from man-made chemicals and each harsh environment element such as wind, heat, hail and lighting..."

Training Tower location

5th floor level

Bed chamber of angel Primus

08:31 a.m.

In the skyline of fresh mountain air, Primus slowly circles one more time through the wet clouds and then swiftly dives down towards the hard rock surface, stopping mid-air before hitting the ground, standing upright in front of the row of open window panes. She walks through the air with her inflated wings and enters her suite, dropping down on top of the hard surface, exhaling with worry. She moves ahead and scoots around the bed frame, stopping behind the rear mattress, reaching in-between the soft fabric. She grabs and then pulls out a long sword, back stepping from the bed frame, holding the blade parallel to the floor. Her eyeball catches the swift movement through the open archway into her room and as she grunts out loud, "Father!"

"Cupcake!" Caiden enters her room with a smile and stares at his daughter.

"I can fight in the war, Father. I'll been training with my angel weapon, too." She holds a heavy sword four inches up from the floor in front of her bed mattress while grunting with pain.

Caiden stops and sits down in a cross-legged pose with a pair of inflated wings that glitter in the sunlight, smiling with happiness from the opposite side of the room. He watches her lousy manipulation with the dull weapon. The sword is a training weapon for a young warrior angel with many years of muscle and tissue strength, not his delicate daughter of five feet and two inches in height and 95 pounds in weight.

Taken by the demon prince Preston at five angel years old, his daughter Primus had never engaged in a violent battle with another creature or sub-creature. Caiden had been relieved to hear the good news. Even though, he truly hates Preston with deep passion and will until Preston or Caiden is permanently dead down here on the Earth plane. Therefore, Primus doesn't know how to operate a sword, a battle axe, a crossbow, or an electronic microwave.

Caiden chuckles at his young angel daughter.

After the last demon Un-learneth memory loss has been removed from her mental mind, Caiden can teach his daughter everything about being a lady angel, where she has missed over the past fifty million years.

On top of the floor, he nods at her poor weapon performance with amusement. "You're very good, cupcake. However, you are my daughter. I don't want you in the fray as the humans say."

She strains her neck muscles and swings the blade side to side, grunting out loud, "I..." she exhales with pain, "... should do my part, Father."

Caiden chuckles, "Your part is to stay out of my way, cupcake."

She drops the metal sword with a dull thump on top of the hard floor and turns with a smile at Caiden. "I can mend wings."

"You're not a healer."

She smiles. "I can be the spotter for the warrior angels."

"Naw! You're not trained to spot." He shakes his skull in disagreement.

"I can scout for the group of warrior angels, then." She places both of her fists on her waistline.

"You'll get captured again." He comprehends the real warning here. Preston has demanded his daughter in exchange for peace with the village of faithful angels.

Preston is stupid and bold since he knows the war is coming between angels and demons. He just needs an excuse to start the war and Caiden needs a cause to end the war.

She slaps her chest with a stern face, "I can take care of myself, Father."

"I'm responsible for taking care of you which I can't do, if you get in my way, cupcake."

She strolls ahead, stops and sits down in a crossed-leg pose in front of her father to continue the debate. "Do you know how many fathers and daughters have engaged in this very timely intense and heated conversation over the millennium about fighting within a single battle for the cause of the family name?"

"Millions..." he chuckles.

"Zillions...." she nods.

He shakes his bone skull, "Only 106,546,367,669 individual souls had lived here on Planet Earth, since first born son Adam, not zillions, cupcake."

She frowns. "How do you know that figure for the world, Father?"

He grins. "I update the internet with the current figures every week." He cocks his chin and closes his eyelids, hearing a set of invisible words inside his mind, opening his eyelids. He nods with a smile. "Oops! Our welcome company has finally arrived."

She gasps with worry and whispers for her eardrums only, "Preston!"

He connects, links, and then mental talks to Teague, who is the first commander of the troops and Jazmine, who is the first general of the strategy regarding the flock of un-invited guests that continue to fly towards Sandia Crest of 10,678 feet high in the sky on the small mountain range and away from the village of Angel Haven.

Caiden swiftly stands upright from the floor with a smile and struts ahead to the row of glass-less window panes as his happy demeanor quickly turns into somber and serious mood with a flirt of deadly intent. He stops and stands in front of the open window while his inflated pair of wings flutter back and forth glittering in black and gold hue. He tries to view the pod of approaching demons with his angel senses.

Primus swings around from the archway with puzzlement and faces the back spine on her father, searching with her two angel eyeballs the skyline for demon leader Preston also. "Can you see Preston and his pack of demons from this far geographical distance, inside my room? How can you see them, Father?" She gasps in alarm and spins around with a smile, racing ahead towards the open archway. She desires to see Preston first, before the actually war fights begin, since Primus seeks peace with Preston and her father. Preston has to be reasonable with Primus, because she is truly an angel, not a demon while belonging with flock of faithful angels and not pod of fallen demons.

Caiden gasps in alarm and lifts up from the floor, soaring backwards through the air waves, landing in front of the open archway while reading her young angel mind with worry. He reaches out and catches her arms, whispering into her smile with worry, "Cupcake!" He hugs Primus and then pulls back with a stern face, slowly surrounding her upright body with his pair of wings. He starts to coughs out loud and then performs numerous sneezes from her nasty demon smell that permeates the air current, and then finally recovers, clearing his tight throat. "Give me a hug for great luck, cupcake!"

She leans over and performs a fatherly hug as he slowly draws his wings around her sweet embrace, coughing and then sneezing from her nasty demon smell. She whispers with worry. "Father, I wish great luck for you and all the other angels and me too." Her mind whirls with mental steps of her new angel plan.

Her first task is to locate and talk to Preston. Maybe, she can change his demon mind about the upcoming bloodshed and then leave the flock of angels alone here on their mountain. She tries to remove her arms from his body but her upright body is frozen in a hugging pose with both arms in a curved position. She yells out loud with frustration, "Father!"

"Primus, this is for your own good. You're my daughter. I told you. You are not going to fight in the war with the other more experienced fighting warrior angels, cupcake." Caiden coughs and then sneezes out loud slowly removing his wings from around his daughter, touching her body with his angel magnet moment.

Skin is an outer cover on a human.

And skin is also located underneath a pair of wings on a demon with a different nature, composition, and purpose, since a pair of demon wings protects the body against pathogens, water loss. Also, the demon wings function as insulation, temperature regulation, sensation, and a deadly weapon, composing multiple layers of ecto-dermal tissue and muscles, without any hard bones or delicate ligaments or soft internal organs.

Rows of fluffy feathers serve the angel with degrees of warmth, insulation, and beauty but hold a magnet force with other row of feathers. When the pair of wings on angel Teague had beautifully reached out, surrounded, and then touched Priam's wings creating a bright orange neon magnetic moment there on the Key West military base in the US State of Florida.

In the field of Earth science, a magnet is a force that pulls the ferromagnetic materials into an electron shell which attracts or repels other magnets. In any ordinary ferromagnetic material, the tiny magnets are scattered all over the place and each one of their magnetic fields cancel out each other out, thus creating no magnetism force.

A magnet normally does not stick together.

Within a pair of angel wings, the southern wing tip on the left side is lovingly or dangerously attracted to the right side of the other southern wingtip. Then the angel concave-shaped form colorfully electrifies a semi-circular balance, which is known as the magnetic flux.

The empty space in-between the two wing tips becomes an enclosed singular electron shell of organized atoms of tiny ferromagnetic particles, holding magically any or many man-made or nature objects as the tiny particles are composed of lead, zinc, copper, brass, nickel, iron, aluminum, and other earthy metals, floating around the atmosphere as the particles scatter inside the space between a pair of demon wings. When an angel becomes a magnet and then loses each one of their individual properties, the air field collapses and then forms into a visually strong colored electromagnetic shell.

Inside the bedroom setting, her father Caiden has gathered an electron shell around her body forming a protective magnet cocoon in the dull color of grey hue that represents the love of his daughter while naturally blending his black and golden tinted wings into her pale pink colored wings. An electromagnetic shell embraces her skull, her set of curved arms, going down towards her toes. Caiden has made Primus into his young pupa inside her bedroom chamber.

She can't move her body or any of her limbs. "I...I can't move my hands or my arms." She frowns in protest while understanding his magnet cocoon formation with his angel powers.

Teague had displayed the same ancient angel talent with Primus a couple of days ago.

On top of the floor, Caiden slowly back step and views the pink hue shell on Primus, chuckling with a smile. "This is only a temporary angel condition, until I can place my angel shielding around each open and glass-less door archway and each open window pane on this building and throughout the compound also. So, you can't escape from the Training Tower or your personal bedroom and join the war with me or Teague, Primus."

She glares at her father through the grey hue angel shield with worried love, not hate, turning to scan her bedroom setting as an array of pretty sun rays dance down on the rock floor like a prism with different colors from the rainbow. Her eyeballs still dart around the atmosphere and as she returns back and gasps at her father. "I can't believe this moment of my life. I can't move my body or my limbs from my body. And you have locked me inside my room, like a naughty kid, Father." Her body is covered in gray hue and displays both arms in a curved pose.

He grins with a nod. "I should've done this maneuver when you were five years old. Hindsight, it is a flawed disability even for an angel like me," chuckling.

"No angel or demon or human possess the hindsight ability, Father."

He reaches out and twitches her nose within the gray electromagnetic shell, laughing with amusement at his daughter. "Only you possess the hindsight ability using the Un-learneth tool, cupcake."

She exhales with deep sour breathes without shifting her body parts. "Yeah, I guess so. I had never mentally thought about it like that." She exhales with annoyance. "How long am I to be in my frozen state, Father?"

"You will stay within your temporary angel frozen state for fifteen seconds." He leans over and lightly kisses her smooth cheekbone with his love as she poses upright with both of her arms curved in the air. He coughs and then sneezes, back stepping with a grin at his daughter. "Fifteen seconds will provide me a swift exit from the compound and you, Primus." He chuckles and pivots slowly exiting through the open archway, waving his hand in the air with laughter. He swiftly erects a second golden angel shield inside her private doorway and throughout the Training Tower building to keep her and all the young children that reside inside the nursery safe and sound.

Inside her bedroom, on top of the blue tinted rock floor, Primus yells out loud without moving her body, "Father!"

His voice carries coming from an empty hallway into her eardrums and as his finger continues to aim and block each open window. "The angel and demon war will be short, swift, and sweet, cupcake. I promise. You can't leave from here, Primus. However, you can watch the bloody war from your row of blocked glass-less windows. The only one that can come through a window or a doorway on my angel shield is me," he chuckles with delight and swiftly moves down the staircase while continuing to shout in the air waves that invade her two eardrums. "This is my special angel mixture. However, I will return back here to the Training Tower, Primus. Then you will finish up that last demon memory using the Un-learneth tool. Then you and me and every angel will live happily ever after here in Angel Haven. I'll see you later, cupcake!" He exits the building and then blocks the open archway with his angel talents.

Inside her bedroom, Primus continues to pose in a frozen state but can move her lips and her eyeballs. She yells out loud with worry, "Father!"

Her father isn't going to let his daughter become get captured again by demon leader Preston. Caiden has gently reminds Primus with that specific statement at one hundred and one times during the day and night house, after he had received that ransom note that had been signed with a thick strand of red colored tomato sauce alphabetic word on top of an extra-large cheese pizza that had been delivered by the two humans, Palmer.

Demon leader Preston had sent their human friends by a human airplane to skydive down through the sky and then delivery a container of pizzas. The two humans had been whisked off the mountain peak and then memory-wiped with the encounter with a flock of faithful angels by ancient angel Jazmine, and finally safely delivered back to the Key West military base last night.

However, angel Teague could not wait for the upcoming bloody deadly war with the pod of fallen angels.

She nods with a stern face and counts out loud, "Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen seconds have expired," Primus shuffles her arms around with a smile. "I'm finally free!" She flings her arms and legs from each frozen spot bouncing up and down from the floor, spinning around and dashes to the row of windows. The interior space glows with a golden tint that could be mistaken for numerous rays of bright sunlight. Her father is very clever.

She leans into the angel shield that does not burn her nose bridge and scans the skyline for Preston. However, the war fight is not located here on Angel Haven but on the shorter range of mountains at the 9,702 foot high Sandia Sand Peak. She can't see the physical fighting with her pair of angel eyeballs since the Training Tower building overlooks the wrong direction with the angels and demons.

Her father is a very smart angel.

09:19 a.m.

Sandia Mountain Range

City of Albuquerque within the US State of New Mexico

(132 miles, south, from Taos)

Sandia Sand Peak 9,702 height

Sunny without clouds

Mostly dry air

Air temperature 63˚F

Precipitation 0%

Humidity 70%

Southwestern winds at 04 mph

A rough array of jagged peak tops continues to jerk up and down over seventeen miles throughout the Sandia Mountain Range while rising into a set of single cone-like sharp points against the pale blue sky. Each peak is made of hard granite and covered splatters of white and pink tinted rock.

The Sandia Sand Peak crest is 9,702 feet into the air waves without cloud coverage like the Sangre de Cristo mountain peaks of 14,000 feet.

Ancient angel Jazmine stands behind angel leader Caiden on top of the highest jagged crest at 9,702 feet height that lounges against a pale blue background. Each exposed angel with a pair of inflated and colorful wings straddles the next lower jagged point on a pair of booted feet. Or his or her angel body clings sideways onto the high peak slope while each pair of eyeballs continues to watch a clear eastern skyline for the approaching enemy. And each angel holds a silver tinted sword in a cupped right hand in silence.

Angel captain Teague stands down on the next lower peak on the right side of Caiden and Jazmine, scanning the skyline in silence.

Angel Scooter stands on the next lower peak on the left side of Teague and slaps his straight hand over his eyeballs for fun, yelling out loud with a smile each one of his nature comments. "I see groves of cool green trees and sheer rock faces sloping down each side on the mountain peak here at crest. And I have a clear unobstructed view of the eastern or the western skyline, which is clear of debris and demons, Teague."

Angel Veck wobbles below Scooter on top of an individual jagged crest, smiling at the pretty terrain. "Well, I see numerous people hiking trails and vehicle road pathways, and mountain bike trails for an adventurous fun activity, without the set of smelly humans. Each clear pathway is lined with lush, thick, tall, and green tinted fir, spruce and evergreen trees, including the nesting beetles."

"Where are the humans?" Bandy stands firm below Veck and reaches out, gently touching a flying hummingbird with one hand, feeding a friendly gray tinted deer with her other hand with food items. Her exposed limbs are covered in blue tinted mountain birds and other parked yellow tinted hummingbirds. At her booted foot, a friendly brown tinted chipmunk stands on its rear legs and paws the air for food from the angel also.

Veck turns and smiles down at his girl. "A strong wind of numerous swishing angel wings had produced the sound of loud trumpets that echoed throughout the skyline and from the clouds. Each human had mental thought that a pod of outer space aliens was attacking them, so each one had fled, driving away from the Sandia two crests in fear and panic," he laughs. "Now, we're ready to win the final, bloody battle fight."

Caiden opens his mind and enters into each angel, saying through his angel thoughts. "Attention! Attention here! The Sandia Crest and the Sandia Sand Peak are now closed due to dry weather and fi..."

"....flying blood proteins...." One angel laughs into each mind also.

Caiden continues. "We all stand tall and ready here on the crest. The temperature is a cool 62 degrees up here and no clouds of rain, only bright blinding sunshine with four miles per hour winds. A good day to fly! Down there on the land surface, the air temperature is 92 degrees, so if you fight down there with our known enemy be prepared to sweat and burn your tail feathers off along with experiencing shallow breathing and a dizzy headache until your body adjusts to the extreme heat. This is why we live on top of a mountain peak. The human picnic tables and hiking trails are..."

"....three dollars for day usage," Scooter invades the mental mind speech from Caiden with laughter. "And if you wanna hang out here with the trees and birdies all night, you gotta pay thirty dollars at the Forest Station in Tijeras. However, everything is clean and shiny including the bathrooms, except for a few spots of colorful graffiti symbols by a few nasty, smelly human teens..."

"Shut up, Scooter!" Jazmine stands against the back spine with Caiden and looks down with a sneer at the mature angel."

Caiden laughs and then continues. "We are located two miles about sea level and have a view of 300 miles of valley plains on a clear day without clouds or rain storms. So, we will easily spot the enemy as they fly from the east towards us. Now, every angel said a good-bye to each one of your visiting nature friends. We don't want any nature friends harmed or killed."

Each angle reaches out and communicates the danger within the simple mind of the animal, consisting of black bears, grey deer, brown tinted chipmunks, blue colored mountain birds, and yellow tinted hummingbirds. Then each animal flies or races off the mountain peak with an individual fearful animal sound.

At the 300 mile mark within the air waves, in the far distance, a line of rolling black, red, and purple tinted clouds soar ahead and cover every square inch within the pale blue sky. The sound of thunder loudly roars throughout the air waves. Sheets of heavy silver tinted raindrops pour down from the row of dark clouds. Individual white and yellow tinted lightning bolts dance brightly through the dark clouds.

A strong hurricane wind carries thousands of red tinted swishing wings with assorted leather and feather accouterments flapping out of sync, but moving swiftly from the eastern skies towards the western horizon at the Sandia Mountains. Each demon can feel an angel's presence there, not inside the tiny village of Angel Haven.

Demon prince Preston leads the pod of brave demons holding his curved golden tinted sword in a cupped left hand. Each demon fights with a dominant left hand while an angel performs a kill with the right hand.

Demon princess Colee flies on his left side and demon general Radium soars on his right. The paired demon couple Blaze and Barbie swiftly soars behind them holding a glowing golden tinted blade in a left fist also.

At the Sandia Sand Peak, on top of the lower jagged crest, angel Scooter spots the red fiery cloud like a swarm of bees first which is swiftly advancing from the eastern skyline behind the cloud of thunder and rain, moving towards the western air waves.

Scooter performs an angel-yell to Teague and points at the thunder clouds which hides the demons, "What's our fighting strategy, Teague?"

Veck sneers at the swarm of dark clouds and bounces up and down with nervous, "Any strategy will do as long as blood and tail feathers are involved, ya'll."

"We will perform the scrimmage strategy," Teague performs an angel-yell to each angel and swishes his sword through the air waves as the blade glitters in the bright sunlight.

Scooter laughs at the dark clouds, "I do believe that you watch too much college football, Teague."

Teague grins. "Don't let the rows of demons cross our angel scrimmage line which starts me and ends with Bandy down there. Does everyone harm me loud and clear?" Each angel grunts back and spies on the dark clouds of hidden demons, swishing a sharp sword in the air waves.

A scrimmage line within the high school football setting is an imaginary line running horizontally across the grassy game field with two fighting teams on either side waiting for the whistle sound to blow starting the physical action play to begin the fight for the small oval shaped pigskin item which is called a football.

Each angel does not hold a soft oval shaped football, but a straight, deadly sharp sword. The angel scrimmage line forms from the northeastern sky down to the southeastern plains on the Sandia Mountains, since angel leader Caiden doesn't want a demon beyond that imaginary line for any reason, until each one of their smelly, nasty, stinky reptile-type wings are accidentally or purposefully cut off during an angel decapitation method with their sword. Then each dead demon body will fall down into the wilderness in hiding from the animals as a human cannot see an angel or a demon. After the bloody fight, Caiden will collect each dead demon body and plans to grind up each demon body part along with the red tinted wings providing a set of poopy manure for the rock gardens on Angel Haven.

Last night, during the demon lecture, each angel had learned. A pair of demon wings serves as an anatomical barrier from pathogens for bodily defense, protecting the immune system of demon creature. The rows of demon feathers are composed of many layers of hard matter that cushions its body from stress and strain with many nerve endings, providing a set of demon senses for touch, heat, and smell. The demon wings contain feather follicles and sweat glands that release perspiration. The rows of demon feathers are layered into two structure levels, a superficial field of fine soft feathers on top with colors and a deep thicker region with hardier feathers for strength.

The dark clouds of thunder and rain swiftly advance towards the Sandia Sand Peak, pouring needed watery rain drops down on the dry valley floor, scaring the human citizens in the city of Albuquerque with panic and fear. Angel leader Caiden continues to stand on top of the highest crest and lifts his hand near his smile, wiggling his fingers. The rows of dark clouds dissipate and expose rows of flapping red tinted wings and glittering golden tinted saber that continues to advance towards the stationary and prepared flock of angels.

The first row of red tinted battle gear on each naturally colored demon displays a pair of sparkling red tinted feathers and waxed shiny leather part hitting the scrimmage line, sounding with musical tones from each weapon and every pink tinted tongue.

On top of the jagged crest, Scooter flies off the peak and hovers in the air, slicing through the demon's heart with a smile, pulling back out the beating organ. "The skin of a demon is called rawhide. The intact skin is pre-stretched like a diver's wetsuit over his red tinted demon body. When deep cuts..."

"...deep kills..." Veck twirls his blade into the eye socket on the attacking demon and pulls the tip back out, holding the eyeball, laughing with revenge.

Scooter lifts his blade and slides the arm on the demon. The demon drops down through the air and lands down into a short pile of wiggling, dying or dead demons within the woodlands. He laughs. "When deep kills are made on the rawhide skin, it retracts and widens the sliced hole that spills out all the organs and blood veins, like she-demon down there on the ground," he laughs again.

On the lower single crest, peak, Bandy waits the advancing female demon. "Good note to remember, Scooter!" She whacks the left wing on the she-demon as the demon wing doesn't retract but expands into a bright bluish-green pigment with another variation of flight, saving the Demon's life for fighting. Bandy gasps in shock and then performs an angel-yell back to Scooter. "Her demon wing grew back right in front of my angel eyes."

Scooter battles two more demons. "On a demon, the severely damaged skin will quickly heal and form pieces of new scar tissue which is often, ugly, discolored, and de-pigmented. So, you need to hit the more sensitive organs like the heart or the eyeball or the nose bridge," he slices off the tip of the nose bridge on the demon. The demon drops his saber and places both of her hands over her injured nose, crying with pain. Scooter stabs his bloody sword tip in the heart on the demon and then jerks the sword out from the body while laughing out loud. The she-demon speeds down towards the grove of trees and then lands in the same pile of dying or dead bodies.

Veck kills two demons and watches them descend down by gravity science towards the desert while laughing out loud. "Well, that explains the funky color from the prism band on each one of my dead demons."

Scooter slices the red leather wing on each side of her back spine. The she-demon drops down with an expired body towards the earth, landing on top of the growing piles of dead demons.

Veck maneuvers his blade and chops off each wiggling hand on the demon the demon drops his sword and watches his blood drain from his body, slowly falling down into the pile of dead demons, slowly dying.

Scooter battles three demons at the same time. "Too bad, they don't disintegrate when stabbed into nothingness like Preston did during the memory lane event into a pile of tiny red fragments."

Bandy fights with the he-demon and stabs his arm, pulling back her sword, hitting his heart. The demon drops down and screams in pain. She exhales with annoyance. "Yeah, too bad, I guess angel captain Teague gets to clean up each one of the bleeding dead demon dudes and dudettes, after he finds and beats up Preston."

A few miles in the air, in front of row of jagged crest, demon prince Preston slams his fist in-between the two eyeballs on the angel. The angel bows down at his fitted waistline in respect to Preston. Preston punches his golden saber down into the back spine on the dizzy angel. The angel's nerve endings jump from hot to cold as his final death overtakes the lump body.

Preston flies ahead with a sneer and halts mid-air, slamming his body parts into two angels, cutting off each angel limb. The two dead angels drop down and land in the same pile of dead demon while bleeding over the dead bodies, the pretty rows of golden tinted marigold, and the pods of green tinted plant bushes.

Tiny droplets of sweat fly off his angel feathers as his body skin remains dry from rain, hail, and heat. Teague swings his sword to the right and then to the left at three demons, slicing into the body parts, watching each demon skin grow back in twinkling new hues of scar tissue. He sneers and continues to fight each one.

At 09:33 am, back at the Angel Haven village, inside her privately block bedroom suite, Primus stomps side to side with worry in front of the row of golden tinted blocked window panes displaying a western sun for an early afternoon of pretty weather. She fumes inside her mind and her heart as she is locked and sealed inside her prison tower nervously waiting for the final outcome from the second War between the angels and demons.

The war is occurring on a different mountain site from Angel Haven as planned by her father Caiden. Her father Caiden is a clever angel.

The set of demon scouts had flown over each empty building on Angel Haven, discovering a village of empty objects, passing his daughter inside her protective prison tower also. Even Preston does not know of her whereabouts.

Inside her room, in front of the block window panes without glass but a golden hue, Primus stops and shakes her body, inflating her angel wings, slowly wrapping her wings around her cold body. The room is cold for some reason. So, her wings reduce the wetness and dampness from her nervous sweat. She conserves her heat that bleeds in fear, frustration, in case, something happens outside her locked and sealed prison tower. She can't escape out from the physical structure or can't break the angel shield spell inside her prison room or extinguish his might angel powers while her father Caiden battles with demon prince Preston.

Primus is going insanely mad while not being able to hear, see, or host this special invited angel-demon event, sneering inside her prison, worrying about her friends both demons and angels.

At 09:42 am, at the Sandia Sand Peak, the she-demon tears a piece of her dried and crusty rawhide skin from her own demon wing using it to fasten a cocooned, injured, and unconscious male angel onto the tree bark of an ancient oak shade tree. The piece of demon rawhide has a unique feature of sticky-like paste that represents a hook-shaped protuberance that the demon shapes with his hands attaching onto the cocoon structure. He has cemented an object (the angel) onto any structure (the tree) but he can continue to cement an object onto any building, whether man-made or natural with a permanent, deadly outcome.

The nesting beetles and the bright sunlight rays will quickly attack and then consume the necessary body fluids on the captured angel, before one of the other warrior angels notices their comrade missing from the war battle.

The she-demon back flies and then hovers, laughing at the poor angel, swishing her wings through the air, searching for her next victim.

The bumpy surface on each demon wing helps strength the two layers of demon feathers while the dense irregular connective tissues contains elastic and protein fibers that provides strength, extensibility, and elasticity. But, most importantly, this bumpy surface region contains the roots for the fur on some demons, as well as, all the smooth feathers, sweat glands, rawhide, and blood vessels.

On top of the jagged crest, angel captain Teague whips the demon blood from his naked neck and chin, laughing with amusement. "Yeah, and the demon also carries fresh sizzling blood proteins inside their rawhide leathery wings too."

Scooter battles a pesky she-demon with the set of pretty pink and neon green feathers and a biting attitude. He slices off her left thigh-high boot at her flesh thigh and then stabs his sword through her breasts, twisting his face to smile at Teague. "The epidermis on an ocean fish and other water amphibians consists of live cells permeable with respiratory functions that are made up of solid, protective bony scales."

"Hey, skull bones!" Teague laughs at the she-demon. She turns and grins without teeth at Teague. "Well, I just called that one wrong. I should've said, old woman." He engages the older demon with a sneer.

Scooter turns and watches Teague chase off the older demon, laughing out loud. "On Planet Earth, the reptilian class of lizards, snakes, and iguanas possesses a set of outer scales in different colors and textures."

Teague can't reach the old demon female and halts in the air, rearing back, tossing the tip of his sword into her eyeball that connects. She-demon screams in pain and drops down her sword, falling down towards the earth, wiggling in death. He dives down and jerks out the sword with laugh, yelling out loud back to Scooter. "Cartilaginous fish also possesses tooth-like denticles, which is embedded in their skin, in place of true outer fishy scales."

"O! That must be his mama," Veck punches the eye socket on the he-demon and then cuts off the protruding red tinted nose bridge with his sword blade, laughing out loud with amusement. The demon drops down and screams in a dying death, landing on top of the same tall pile of dead demons and angels.

"Sweat glands are common in mammals, humans, and angels." Scooter strikes the enemy with a clean shot at the side face temple on the demon with his sword.
"You didn't mention the nasty, smelly pod of fighting and bloody demons, Scooter." Bandy kills the male demon and then frowns down at the falling body. The dead body lands on top of the same pile of dead demons and angels.

Teague fights and laughs. "Bandy, she's the valedictorian of the angel class to day." Then he kills the male demon.

"Because a demon does not possess a set of sweat glands, but each one stinks to high heaven." Veck laughs and continues to fight the she-demon.

"Because, a demon possesses something greater within my two eyeballs," Scooter notes the odd shape on each demon wing. Jazmine had not bothered to mention this odd shape to each angel during the demon lecture last night.

"I know the odd shape within my eyeballs. It's the human food between their set of yellow stained teeth." Teague slices down at the naked neck on the female demon and watches the demon plummet down into the same tall pile of dead bodies.

Veck flies backwards and stares at an odd shape underneath the wing on the demon with worry, shouting out loud at Scooter, "Tell!"

"An ocean fish displays numerous mucus-secreting skin cells," Scooter grins with his new demon secret and fights with the older male demon.

"Tell us, Scooter!" Teague kills the smelly demon and then coughs out loud, sneezing from the drifting powdery wing explosion, invading his two nose holes like Primus' stinky demon stench.

Scooter cuts off the one of the demon wings with laughter. "The mucus-secreting skin cells contain poisonous glands and photophres which are cells that produce a watery, serous..."

"O! That's some serious fluid of toxin on their leathery skin. Got it!" Teague hammers the demon into dead and watches the sliced body drop down into the growing pile of death creatures.

Scooter smiles. "In a water amphibian, their mucus cells are gathered together to form a set of sac-like glands."

"O! That's some bags of poisons!" Teague fights with a new demon.

Scooter continues to fight with a female demon. "Each skin gland can secrete out a stream of irritating or toxic compounds through the air and then lands on your angel body which will burn and sting and might even kill you dead, Teague," he laughs and kills the demon, watching the body fall down with gravity into the woodlands.

Teague stops with a gasp in mid-air and twists his face towards Scooter. Scooter turns and grins at Teague. Teague returns back and kicks his leg into the face on the demon, performing an angel-yell to each fighting warrior. "Okay! Geez! Every angel, this is Teague. Continue to fight and kill, but definitely avoid the odd shaped sac underneath the demon's wings. Out, Teague!" The fighting demon faces into Teague's face. Teague stabs his sword into the heart on the demon and pulls out his sword. The demon dies and drops down into the pile of death.

Veck hovers in the air and swishes his wings, pointing at a re-grown wing modification on the injured demon with laughter, "The demon rawhide has changed color again."

Scooter slices his sword through the air and misses the next demon. "Normally, skin does not change in the dermis."

Veck jabs a finger at the sneering demon. "Look out! My demon is colored green, instead of red," he slices off each arm on the fighting demon, laughing out loud. "And, now, the green demon is dead."

Scooter kills two more demons. "The mammal class of chameleons and flounders are able to change the color of pigments by adjusting the relative size of their chromatophores."

"You're too smart, Scooter!" Teague smiles and fights with another demon.

"Yeah, I know." Scooter toys with the two smaller demons for torment and then stabs each one in the heart, watching the limp bodies drop down into the pile of death on the grassy woodlands.

"Hey, toady frog! Come over here and get me!" Veck waves a hand at advancing line of Demons.

Scooter poses in the air and in thought, smiling at a new line of demons, "O! I got one more thing to say!"

Veck frowns. "What do you wanna say now, Scooter?"

Scooter nods. "Like the category of flying birds and walking reptiles, the outer skin has a few more glands. Each one possesses pheromone-secreting cells..."

"O! The mammal smells good to the touch." Teague laughs and fights the new line of demons.

"Naw!" Scooter laughs. "Actually, when the animal is injured, it stinks towards the moon."

Teague kills the demon and scans the air waves with a sneer, "I just wanna smell Preston die!" He flies ahead through the skyline while viewing only a few lines of white and red hues that represent the remaining angels and demons. Then he gasps in alarm and stares at the highest peak, Caiden is missing but Jazmine is there fighting there in his spot. He spins around and searches the air waves for Caiden without spotting the angel leader. Some of the rows of demons have broken off and are fighting on the earth soil. Caiden might be there instead.

Teague swings back around with a sneer, searching for his enemy demon prince Preston.

***

At 10:10 am, back at the Angel Haven, inside her private bedroom, her angel eardrums hear a loud scary noise coming outside the blocked entrance door at the Training Tower building. She spins around from the row of window panes and paces rapidly, stopping in front of the golden shield feeling worried, even though she does believe in her father and his awesome angel powers.

He promised to his daughter that no one can come through his angel shielding, but him.

At her entrance archway, Primus slowly back pedals from the glittering protective entrance archway and nods with confidence, not drawing attention of her person from the pod of visiting demons at the front entrance door of the Training Tower building.

Throughout human world history, the main gate is the most dangerous spot within a medieval castle with invasion from a set of invaders which is usually used as a deadly trap by opening into a small courtyard at far end of door. The main gate usually holds set of iron portcullis that are sharpened and then dropped down deadly onto the invaders that are trapped inside the courtyard. The walls inside the courtyard hold an array of small secret holes which are called death holes, where the group of castle soldiers can fire out an array of sharp arrows and sharp projectiles down into each invader for the final kill.

Here, within Angel Haven, the Training Tower contains a beautifully curved entrance archway, so each kid angel can enter and then exit the wide doorway without injury while learning to fly and hover in the air with their wings skills of flight. A few feet in front of the tower, a courtyard displays rock coated furniture and numerous gardens of rocks, not flowers.

Each invading demon drops down from the skyline and lands on top for the pink and blue colored rock surface, scanning an empty compound without guards of angels, running into the nearest buildings into nothingness. Angel leader Caiden is a powerful angel but he can't fight and then shield each entrance opening on every building within the village. So, he has used his limited angel tricks and protected his daughter Primus and her secret chamber from each demon and Preston as long as Primus stays put and out of harm.

Throughout human world history, the castle steps had been designed for fear and fright as each stairwell curved up into a tower structure with a set of narrow steps in a clockwise direction for confusion to each invader. Advancing up the staircase, each invader held one hand onto a curved banister and the other hand with their weapon, preventing the swing of a deadly sword or two in a steady motion from the castle occupants. Each step displayed an uneven feature moving up towards the tower structure in alternating in tall and short patterns, so each invader tumbled backwards, instead of marching forward while advancing towards the castle occupants.

Here within Angel Haven, each tower staircase is grand and wide allowing a row of angels to stroll elegantly and gracefully up or down the rock coated steps, holding hands or long arms with each other, wearing a pair of inflated wings.

Outside the angel compound, each invading demon exits from an empty building in frustration and advances towards the last building, the Training Tower. A tight huddle formation of demons whisper and examine the angel-shield with disappointment. Some of the demons slowly lift off the ground and scout around the stationary structure while hunting for an entrance point.

Throughout human world history, a medieval castle isn't complete without a secret passage, mainly for the royal class of the castle occupants to escape the impending attack or receive food supplies during a battle siege or hide their persons in safety.

Here, within Angel Haven, the tower room contains a row of high and lower window glass-less panes that appear with a golden tint of color of angel protection. The horde of flying demons slow their speed and huddle in the air without finding a secret entrance into the security building, smelling an angel and then hears a loud yell. Each one looks up with a sneer and attacks the falling object with a group of demonic fury.

In front of the entrance archway, the golden tinted shield blinks off and then on, allowing an individual demon to enter the lobby space, dashing up the staircase and pose in front of a new golden tinted entrance archway that leads into a room with an angel.

Inside her bedroom setting, Primus stops over the floor and gasps in alarm, viewing the demons at the door. They want in as she wants out.

Outside the shielding, a dumb demon punches his fist into the golden glittering bedroom archway as his red tinted skin and matching fingers quickly melt into a pile of red sizzling goo. He screams in pain and stumbles away from the entrance door, tumbling down the staircase into a painful death.

A second brave demon touches the angel-shield with his sword tip. The metal tip melts down into a puddle of golden goo, since angel leader Caiden is a very good protector of his daughter.

Inside the interior rock coated walls, angel Primus continues to stand and smirks with safety, until her father arrives for the rescue.

From the highest window pane, Caiden smashes through the golden shield and creates a loud whistling sound. Primus screams out loud in fear and drops down onto the floor, covering her face with fear. His folded body with a pair of inflated wings swiftly drops down through the air waves and then lands hard down on the rock floor, stopping three feet short from the entrance archway. He does not move but rests on his broken back spine while continuing to blood over his body and the floor in his set of red tinted proteins from numerous deep skin cuts and slashes on his angel flesh, exhaling with heavy set of sour breathes.

Primus looks up from her hidden arms and gasps in horror, "Father!" She screams with worry and stands upright, racing ahead, sliding down over the hard surface. She sobs in fear and slowly extends both of her naked hands on top of his bloody face.

Caiden had entered her bedroom setting through highest open window, breaking his own angel shield, since only he can come through the angel-shield to his daughter.

Now, Primus has been exposed to the elements of sky, winds and demons. She must run and hide for her safety from each attacking demon and then somehow connect with her angel-telepathy directly to Teague.

"Primus..." Caiden continues to lie on top of hard rock floor in spreading puddles of his own bloody and slowly wheezes out a set of sour air molecules from his bloody mouth.

"Father!" She sobs with all of her sad tears at his fatal condition and views his bloody body that is more red than white.

He exhales with pain and closes his eyelids, whispering to her, "Cupcake, one chance..."

She gasps in alarm and leans down into his bloody face with curiosity. "What is my one chance, Father? I don't understand your words."

"You..."

"Me!"

"We're losing..." He wheezes nosily. "You..."

She gasps with worry. "Your body is severely injured, Father. I'll go and get help from Teague."

He reaches out and touches her naked arm with his bloody hand, blinking into consciousness, exhaling with heavy breathes of pain. "You and Teague, make me proud."

"Marriage! Do you want me to marry Teague?" She gasps in shock as Teague talks about marriage all the time.

He gurgles with bloody salvia and then spits out blood from his pair busted lips, swallowing the rest of the blood down his esophagus. His eyelids open and then close and as his voice is soft, "Yes..."

"Father!"

"Promise me..."

"Father!" She continues to sob with sadness and hot tears.

"Go and help Teague..."

She frowns between the tears. "How...how can I help, Teague?"

He inhales the fresh air and holds his breath whispering to her. "You possess one final demon memory. You must Unlearn-eth..."

She nods. "Jazmine told me there is one final demon memory left within my soul. Yes, you are correct, Father."

He wheezes out his final angel command. "Go, Primus! Go back into your final past demon memory and perform the Un-learneth concept. Then..."

"Then what, Father?" She ponders his dying command to honor her father and her fiancé Teague. "Then, what will happen to me, to you, to Teague?"

"We win." Caiden slumps into silence with a pair of open eyelids in permanent death.

She scans his two eyelids that do not blink in life. She scans his Adam's apple that does not move. She moves her hand to his waist bone for a pulse that does not exist. Caiden, her father of four days within her new angel memories is dead.

She exhales with angry and then inhales wit fury, swiftly standing upright from the floor, looking up into ceiling at heaven. She yells in fury and loss. "No! No! No!" She cries with tears and then squats back down on the floor, leaning over, searching for his sword, without finding his angel sword. She reaches down and touches his broken angel wing, moving her hands, touching his cold face. Finally, she touches gently his still hand and curses in fury from her loss again.

Primus looks up with tears and turns to see the archway with a pair of blurry eyeballs. Rows of nasty red tinted demons mouth drool, jump up and down, sneer, and snort at her. The golden tinted angel shield at the archway is slowly crumbling, exposing the cool air waves inside the hallway. She doesn't possess an angel and doesn't know how to swing a sword at one demon, much less a room of demons. But, Primus has the Accipio dream state tool which she can use as her final weapon against demon prince Preston for taking away her father and her angel life.

Four days and nights, Primus had performed the Accipio dream state which resulted in losing all her past demon memories with Preston and his pod of demons, except for one precious demon memory that still resides inside her active brain cells.

She continues to squat on the floor and cries over her father's dead face. Primus should've have lost the final demon memory, before the war, before the pizza note, before the angel festival, and before the night has ended.

The very first demon memory floods her mind, faster and furious, rather than the other past demon memories, because she use mind-control on the first encounter and then tucks the demon memory deep down within her psyche, so deep down into her sub-conscious that ancient Jazmine can't see or feel it either.

Ancient Jazmine continues to use her angel telepathy to monitor the person and the mind within Primus using the Un-learneth progress. And Jazmine is reason that the final demon memory has not surfaced, since Jazmine also holds back some important information about the Accipio concept from Primus and her father.

Primus feels something special and unique about first demon memory and Jazmine will not say what will finally happen to everyone who is involved within the Accipio concept either.

Her last memory is really her first memory, when Primus had met Preston on a sandy beach shoreline.

Within her first demon memory, demon prince Preston had been resting on top of the white tinted sands and continued to bleed red protein from numerous skin cuts and brown yucky wounds, since had been gratefully injured from the Garden of Eden war.

During the past few days, Primus had asked repeatedly to Jazmine about the final fate of Preston within the Accipio concept and the disappearance of her final demon memory.

Jazmine had always answered with an evil sneer, "Preston will die foreverly."

Squatting over her dead father's body, angel Primus sobs with worry while deeply feeling true love with Preston, even though he is a demon. She also loves angel Teague, too, even though he is an angel. Since her kidnapping from Key West and return back here on Angel Haven, Teague has been kind and tender with Primus but not always truthful about each fact. Teague only desires marriage, after she completes the Accipio concept.

Primus is an angel with one final demon memory that remains intact, making her a unique creature on Planet Earth and her decision will stop the war between the angels and demons, if her dead father's words are correct.

She back slides from her dead father and wipes off the sad tears, struggling over the floor, looking up to see the entrance archway. The golden tint is slowly ripping out of place. One demon tries to dive through but ends up in a dead state.

She returns back and stares at the far wall, posing a cross-legged position, inflating out her pink tinted angel wings. She places both cupped hands into the folds of her leg, exhaling with a series of deep breathes, relaxing her mind.

At 10:31 am, the last demon memory floods her mind. The last one that Caiden, Teague, Jazmine, Scooter, Bandy, and Veck have desired to be purged out from her demon body in order to return back into an innocent angel girl.

50 million years ago

Garden of Eden location

Early afternoon time period

White tinted beach sands and blue tinted ocean waters

43 degrees Fahrenheit of cold air temperatures

33 miles-per-hour howling cold winds

Dark sky of dark clouds without sunlight

Angel Primus instantly flashes from her mountain peak bedroom setting and sits on top of white tinted sandy beach with a pair of crossed-legs, feeling the cold air, blinking her eyelashes open.

The landscape is white tinted sand that looks dull and lifeless. The sunlight is dull and dark as the sun hides behind rolls of dark clouds. The wind is fierce and cold on her body.

However, Primus is really here within her past life as if she is living in the present in flesh, blood, and bones.

She swiftly stands and scans the open miles of dull sand grains and rough waves of salt water from howling cold winds, spotting an outline of red tinted demons. Each demon is tall and slender with a pair of matching inflated wings. The huddle encircles an object down on surface of the sand, demon prince Preston.

Primus uses her angel eardrums and hears each audible word as their soft conversation carries across the sands and waves like she is standing directly within the middle of the huddle among the smelly demons.

She sneers with revenge, steps forward and then halts, slapping her hands over her body, feeling her angel battle gear without an angel sword. Her loving and now dead father had not allowed Primus to possess a deadly weapon. However, that situation might change really soon for Primus.

Within her first backward demon memory, both demon Priam and Preston had been milking a cow on a dairy farm in the village of Duns within the country of Scotland, in the year 1706 AD. After angel Primus had vanquished her demon self, demon Preston had broken out from his red tinted demon shell outline, appearing in a flesh and blood body. He displayed his blonde hair and baby blue eyes while staring directly at angel Primus. Then she had lost the demon memory.

Over the four days, more of her past demon memories had become more violent and vocal from Preston. He had broken free each and every time from his red ghostly demon shell, appearing in his red tinted battle gear for a fight or two with angel Teague. Then his band of nasty demon mates consisting of Bandy, Blaze, Radium, and Morton had entered the Accipio dream state and fought with the angels.

Primus lightly sobs with sadness for her silly demon friend Morton, who is really dead like her father in the present, not in the past.

She wipes her tears of sorrow and slaps her hands over her legs, nodding with determination without a sword. Primus cautiously strolls ahead towards the huddle of demons, not really paying attention to the words that form a sentence, since she doesn't care about their past conservations, only for losing her final evil demon memory.

Within the huddle of demon, each one stands close and looks down at the dying body of Preston on top of the sands.

The male voice comes from a tall and slender outline of red that represents Blaze. "I'm beat and tired. I don't wanna do another tango with Teague..."

"...or Scooter or Veck either," the male voice whines from a tall and slender outline of red tint that represents Morton.

The female voice comes from a short and slender red tinted body that represents Barbie. "I agreed with that battle assessment. Come on, sugar! Let us leave from the wet beach scene and go find a warm cave from the cold air and storm clouds for the night."

"Ich dien Barbie," Blaze grabs her hand as they leap up from the wet sands and swiftly fly in a northern direction away from the ocean waters.

"Don't touch it!" The male voice comes from a tall and slender outline of red hue that represents Radium.

The female voice comes from a tall and slender red tinted body type that represents Colee. "I agree with Barbie. We should leave it here!"

"Come on! Let's go, Morton!" Radium cuddles with his guy Morton as they both leap into the air, flying towards the northern direction with Barbie and Blaze.

Colee looks down and kicks her boot, hissing at Preston, leaping up from the wet sands, flying behind Radium and Morton.

Over the wet sands, Primus continues to stroll ahead and watches each demon. The flying gang of demons disappears from the dark skyline. Primus is not supposed to interfere within their past demon memories, only end her first and final demon memory.

She stops and stands over a grounded outline of a red tinted person that represents demon prince Preston.

His body rests in a spread-eagle pose down on top of the white tinted sands and bleeds out red blood proteins running down from his broken nose, parted lips, both damaged eardrums, and numerous gashes on each cheekbone and a diagonal cut on his forehead. His right arm is twisted at an evil angle which exposes his white tinted bones. He displays two nasty broken legs with both feet pointing in the wrong direction. Both of his demon wings are ripped at each wing arch from the hypodermis attaching to the underlying bone and muscle at his shoulder blade.

She cringes at his ugly, injured demon body and then mouth gags from the revolting sight, twisting her face sideways, concentrating on the scene of dull looking wet sand crystals instead of that bloody heap of exposed white bones, red flesh, and gray organ tissues.

She re-focuses her eyeballs and stares down at the colorful figure of five year old child, wearing a pair of two light brown tinted ponytails which are bow-tied with a golden tinted ribbon each, displaying a white colored sundress, a pair of matching ballerina shoes with ribbon bows on a pair of bare feet. Her pair of angel wings shimmery in pink hue, without a golden veil, covering her skull, exhibiting the face of Primus.

On top of the wet sand, angel Primus exhales with sadness and holds a heavy heart, squatting down on her two kneecaps, reaching out with her trembling index finger towards the squatting angel child. Her arm slowly moves closer towards the kneeing child.

Teague is not present here to push Primus into her last angel duty of vanquishing her last demon memory from her active mental mind, since she is all alone on top of the wet sand from 50 million years ago within her first demon memory from the Accipio dream state. She only needs to apply one tap or one touch to lose the first and last demon memory. She exhales with sadness and extends her arm, holding an index finger towards the collar bone on the

A deep baritone voices rumbles at the back spine on Primus. "You cannot touch this one and then perform the unlearn memory wipe."

Primus quickly jumps upright from the sand and stands upright on top of the sand, exhaling with fear, swiftly spinning around with a gasp of worry.

Preston stands with a smile in person, displaying his wavy shoulder length blonde hair, a pair of light blue eyes, measuring in six feet and six inches of height and muscle in a tone of olive colored skin.

She identifies his present reality with a slight odor spicy leather and citrus fragrance that bombards the light breeze, filling her two nostrils with both warmth and security.

He is covered in red tinted blood including his own and his enemy's, wearing an array of pink and red skin cuts, a set of blue and black bruises on his face, his chest, both arms, and both legs, where his tee shirt has been ripped and torn by an angel's sword tip. His left hand cradles a bloody curved golden tinted sword that wears more red than metal.

She inhales a gulp of breath and screams out loud, pointing down at the five year old child. "What! Are you here to kill me now?" Primus spins around with fury and wipes off the tears of worry and sadness, shaking her curls in angry, staring down at the grounded demon that moans and groans in pain from his injuries.

Ancient angel Jazmine had been wrong not providing Primus with all the vital information about the Accipio concept.

Within her first demon memory or the Accipio dream state, true demon prince Preston is standing here in the wet sands, not inside the war battle, trying to kill Primus, before she loses the first demon memory that involves both of them here at a beach scene from 50 million years ago.

Preston performs a demon flash from that spot and then appears facing Primus, dropping his bloody sword down on top of the wet sand that sounds with a soft thump, lifting up a pair of bloody hands near his frown. "Primus, I would never, ever harm you, darling."

She looks up and frowns with fury, pointing down at the child. "Then, it is very obvious to me here. You are present here to stop me from..."

"No." He shakes his curls with a tender voice and face at Primus.

She kicks at sand grains with her boot in angry. "O! Can't you stop me from...?"

"No."

She waves both of her arms in the air and continues to kick the sand with each boot toe yelling at him in angry. "Why? Why are you present with me, right here, right now, Preston? Explain this to me, right now, right here, Preston!" She drops her arms and slaps her legs, drooping her shoulders in worry and. She has always trusted demon prince Preston as he has always protected her body from every one and everything. And she has always believed him and his words.

He continues to stare at Primus and reaches down, jerking off the wet, torn red tinted battle vest that contains patches of blood, his sweat, and the mountain pink tinted dirt. He exposes his bloody chest and exhales with frustration, dropping the dirty garment down on top of the sand, talking tenderly to her. "The memory, it ties us together. I had felt the pull during the war battle. And now, I am here with you."

She frowns with confusion. "Are you really real here from the war battle, Preston?"

"I am as real as you are here at the beach and ocean shoreline, Primus."

She jabs a finger and sneers at Preston, "You! You know me, the real me." She slaps her chest and growls with fury. "You knew the information all the time. Who I really was? Where I had come from? You also knew my origin," Primus points down at the kneeling child that continues to sit beside an injured Preston.

He smiles. "You are an angel, Prims."

She gasps in alarm and shakes her curls, slapping her chest again in shock. "And you also knew of my angel nickname. I don't believe any of this. I don't understand, Preston. How is that even possible for you to know me? We are millions of years apart. I don't understand any of this, Preston. Please! Please explain this thing to me!"

Primus has been betrayed by every individual. The flock of angels has forced Primus to vanquish all of her demon memories, but this one from 50 million years ago. And the pod of nasty demons desires her angel memories for some weird reason. Primus doesn't even know what demon prince Preston wants or the reason for his silly ransom note within a set of steaming pizza. However, Primus desires only happiness within her life.

Once upon a time, demon Priam had experienced happiness when she had lived in the Demon Den with demon prince Preston. She would see each little banshee child hug and then kiss their parents enjoying love as a demon family. She greatly desired a demon child and wanted to get married to Preston, because he had loved her and she had loved Preston.

Seven days ago, demon Priam had waited and then snuck outside the protected military building during the beginning of Curfew. She wanted to prove to both the demons and the angels that they could live together after the six pm hour, since Curfew had separated demon Priam from angel Preston. The only flaw within her demon life was missing her boyfriend Preston every night inside her lonely bedroom. So, if she had married Preston, then she would ever be lonely again. Then, Priam and Preston would have been together foreverly.

Currently, on top of the wet sands, in front of a dying Preston and a squatting child angel, Primus exhales with frustration and stares down at the sands. This terrible situation is her selfish demon fault for wanting happiness with the demon clan, but so wrong about Preston.

Primus sobs out loud but holds back her tears of confusion, hurt, puzzlement, and angry at Preston. He had lied, fibbed, and cheated Priam with 50 million years of happy angel memories. Now, her mental mind holds a few nice angel memories and one demon memory that covers the last 50 million years of her life.

On top of the sand, Preston exhales with sadness and stares down at her hair roots of light brow, tenderly saying. "I knew lots of stuff, Prims."

She looks up with fury and mouth spits in the air, jabbing a finger at his face. "Don't! Do not call me that!"

He lifts a hand near his smile and waves his fingers. The harsh cold wind ceases. The rolling clouds of thunder stops. The nasty thunder storm disappears from the beach setting and reveals a heated, sunny day on top of the wet sands and the ocean of calm waves, "What should I call you, Primus?" He drops his hand and nods to her.

She gasps in shock and scans the new setting with puzzlement. "What did you do here with the storm, Preston?"  
He softly chuckles. "I am a demon. I made it disappear and then replaced the storm clouds with the sunshine."

She frowns with annoyance and returns back, continuing to react in her angel fury to his demon calmness. "No! Don't use my true name, either!"

"All right, angel." He sits down on top of the sand beside his dying body and pulls off each dirty boot that is matted in colorful angel feathers and dried angel blood, exposing his clean two feet and two ankle bones, wiggling his naked ten toes through the cold breeze that feels good on his swollen feet from dancing with angels in the skies over the pink tinted Sandia Mountain Range.

She continues to react with her angel fury and stands on top of the sands, jabbing a finger at Preston. "You also knew about that un-learning thing and the Accipio dream state. I know you do. Don't lie to me, Preston!"

He looks up and nods to her, whispering his words through the harsh wind, "I cared for you, angel."

She slaps her chest and growls at Preston. "No! You had captured me and made me a demon, when I had been five year old. I really..."

"Do you not remember how I cared for you, angel?" He continues to stare into her beautiful eyes and feel her ugly wrath of hate that emits out from her red tinted aura of angel fury and angry.

She exhales with fury and calms her mind without pointing at Preston, whispering her words through the harsh air waves. "You tricked me. You somehow had followed me here to this shoreline beach setting. What do you want, Preston? I don't have time for this. I have to get back to where I belong with the flock of angels," she turns and stares down at the child.

He smiles at her back spine. "The question is: what do you wanna do, lamb?"

She returns back and stares at Preston, after hearing the tender endearment of her demon name. She had always loved that endearment, when Preston had called out that sweet nickname. She had felt loved and cared and happy during that short time of her demon life with the pod of demons.

She sobs with painful memories of former happiness and wipes off the rolling tears, shifting her boot heels down into the wet sand, nodding to Preston. Her long hair flies in the high winds. "What must I do?"

"If you really wanna perform the Un-learneth process..."

She wiggles side to side with nervousness and nods to Preston with a stern face, "Yes, I really want to perform the Un-learneth thing."

He turns and stares at the child, pointing the object, whispering with a stern face. "Then you must pull out the left golden satin ribbon from her cute pigtail."

She turns and studies the left golden satin ribbon with puzzlement. "I clearly see two golden tinted satin ribbons in her two pigtails."

"You must pull out the left ribbon from her left pigtail, if you really wanna perform the Un-learneth procedure."

She stares at the shiny golden ribbon like a live snake. "Teague told me that ribbon only showed what you wanted me to see while I was a captive demon within the demon den. Is that correct?"

He returns back and nods to Primus. "That golden ribbon had protected you from the angels and the demons, lambie pie?"

She returns back and hisses at Preston. "Why!"

The golden ribbon was a mystery inside her mental mind and within Jazmine's mind also, since Jazmine couldn't explain the function of the golden ribbon, beyond the fact that it was a golden satin material which had been used for an ornament of love and beauty on a little girl's hair.

He flips both of his kneecaps upright from the sand and stretches out his back spine, whispering softly to her. "You are an angel, Prims. Some of the demons there at the demon den had guessed your origin. Some of the demon didn't care about your origin. But I cared. I cared for my lambie pie."

"So, I just pull out one of the golden tinted ribbons from one of her girly pigtails. Is the method that simply unlearns my last demon memory?" She feels more doubts and fears than truth here with demon prince Preston.

"You must pull out the left golden ribbon, if you wanna see the truth."

She returns back and growls at Preston. "This is a trick. You are tricking me."

He shakes his curls and wears a sad face. "No. I am not tricking you, angel. You must pull out the left golden..."

"Okay, I heard you the first time," she waves both of her arms in the air and shouts out loud in fury "All right! Fine! But I'm afraid. I'm afraid to do that. Why am I afraid, Preston?"

"This is going to be okay, lamb. It is only a satin ribbon. I promise." He smiles.

She returns back and stares at the golden ribbon. "What happens if I do not pull out the left golden ribbon or pull the right one instead from her girly pigtails?"

He nods at her nose profile. "Then we are still connected within your first demon memory." He exhales with sadness. "Isn't this the reason you came back here 50 million years ago to lose your first demon memory, lambie pie?"

She inhales with worry and then exhales with a nod in silence, shuffling ahead through the thick wet sand and then halts with a stern face. She extends out an index finger towards the collar bone on the child and as her sensitive angel eardrums hears a sickeningly wheeze for oxygen molecules from his broken nose bridge. The terrible sound had imitated her father's dying wheeze, before he had passed into nothingness.

On top of the wet sands, demon prince Preston lies in red tint outline and is slowly dying. The five year old child continues to stare down in silence at the dying creature and reaches out to touch his bloody arm with her tiny naked hand. Somehow, this process had created her first demon memory, which still lingers inside mental mind.

Well, Primus is not going to touch a dying Preston on the wet sand for a second time and turns to sneer at Preston. He does not stand or attack or hiss or sneer back at Primus, only stares at her in silence too.

So, Jazmine had been correct with the Un-learneth concept. If angel Primus doesn't touch an injured demon Preston, then his twisted physical body will die from all of his bloody injuries, where each one of his wounds is beyond a healer's hand touch of demon or angel's magic.

On top of the wet sands, Primus continues to stand and returns back with a sneer, staring down at the child, extending her finger towards the smooth satin as it glitters like golden hue from the bright sunlight. The ribbon is tied around her ponytail which is located on each side of her skull.

Primus swiftly snatches off the left golden tinted ribbon from her ponytail and slowly back steps from the child while ending her first demon memory. Then she stops and stumbles down on her kneecaps into the soft sand, screaming out loud in horror. She drops down her two open palms in the wet sand and stares at the body on the sands.

The red tinted body quickly transforms. The outline of Preston rapidly vanishes and then is replaced with a tiny child. The child possesses a tone of pale colored skin and rests in a spread eagle pose on top of the sands, wearing a pair of light brown tinted pigtails on each side of her skull, displaying a white sundress and a pair of matching ballerina slippers on each one of her twisted feet.

Her mangled tiny body bleeds out all of her blood proteins from a cracked skull, her broken nose bridge, her two eardrums, cuts on both of her arms, bruises on her chest, and wounds on her legs. This thing is not a girl or a child or a physical body anymore. The thing has been viciously beaten.

"The body had been beaten and bleeding." He points down at the tiny angel child. "I had found you here on the edge of the beach shoreline. You were barely alive, Primus."

She whispers with tears of horror and continues to stare down at the child. "No! That's impossible!"

He crawls ahead and sits beside Primus as they both stare down at the wounded angel. He nods with a stern face. "You are seeing the truth here on top of the wet sands from 50 million years ago, Prims."

"No." Primus stares down at the child as the thing mews with soft words for help.

"I had reached out and touched you. Then I had read all your angel thoughts and memories, cupcake." He smiles down at the wounded angel child. "I knew instantly your name, your biological angel father, your betrothal to angel Teague."

"No." Primus stares down at the thing.

Over the past week, Caiden, Teague, and Jazmine had done some super cool angel things that a demon could not perform. So, Primus can do the same cool thing as she was born as an angel, not a demon.

Now, here on top of the wet stands, Primus clearly understands why she can't communicate mentally with demon Preston. Primus had not been his kind but a child angel without her developed angel powers.

Teague lies.

On top of the set stands, Preston continues to squat beside Primus and stares down at the child angel. "I am an old demon, angel. Teague, he told you right. I can read your mind and your thoughts. I can see your future with me, Prims."

"No." She stares down at the thing.

"Touch her!" He smiles.

"No!" She sits back and lands down on top of the wet sands, staring down at the child. "I don't wanna."

He sits back and lands beside her, staring down at the child angel. "This is what you came here to do, Primus. Reach out and touch her!"

She continues to stare at the child angel on top of the wet sands, "I touched the ribbon. I thought the ribbon was the key here. The ribbon shows the golden veil covering my face, where I was Priam, the demon girl. The ribbon has..."

"...the power. No, Prims. The ribbon is only an instrument to protect you from the other demons and from yourself. The ribbon holds no power. It is a soft, satin, golden tinted ribbon that little girl wears in her hair for love and beauty."

"Why isn't my first demon memory gone? I can still feel and smell and see and taste it down inside my soul," she stares down at the wounded angel on top of the wet sands.

"Your first demon memory is gone, Primus."

She exhales with confusion and scans the landscape of calm ocean waves, dry white tinted sands, and a blue sky. "No, I'm still here at the beach shoreline. I can see you. I can smell you. I can talk to you," Primus returns back and stares down at the wounded angel child.

"You can leave anytime you want, Prims. I'm not stopping you. I can't stop you. This had been your first demon memory."

She shakes her curls and stares down at the wounded angel child. Preston is tricking her to leave the beach for some reason. She whispers for her eardrums only, "No! Not yet!" She points down the wounded angel child. "So, this is me. What will happen to me? I don't remember this part of my angel memory."

He looks up and cocks his skull, smiling at the pale blue sky. "Do you hear it?"

She looks up and tilts her skull at the skyline, focusing on the array of sounds, eliminating each ocean splash and squawking seagull. Then she hears a faint voice that is carried by wind and gasps in alarm, "Father! The faint voice is my father. He is in flight and flies through the air."

"They come." He laughs at the skyline.

She looks down and stares at the nose profile on Preston, "Teague, he told me..."

"Teague told you what, Prims?" He looks down and frowns at her. "Teague, he wasn't here at the beach setting. You and I were only here on the beach. Teague was still fighting in Garden of Eden with the other angels and demons."

She stands upright from the sands and points down at the wounded angel, sneering at Preston "Teague, he told me the truth. You had taken me. You had captured me. You could have or should have given me back to my biological father or one of the angels. But you did not perform that charitable feat. Why didn't you do that, Preston? It doesn't matter now. Now, I hear the proof. I am here at the beach. And my father Caiden is coming for me..."

"...but he will not be here at the beach sands in time."

She kicks her boot tip at the sand that flies towards his face, "Liar! You are a liar!" She is sick and tired of Preston's mind games with no real answers to her real questions as the five year old wounded child angel continues to lie on the sands in pain, mewing from her massive injuries for help.

He lifts his hand and wiggles his finger, deflecting the plume of sand to the side without injury. "Teague, did he find any evidence of your injuries here on the beach? You and I are only here right now. Your first demon memory is real. I can hear the set of faint voices of angels also." His skull tilts up toward the skyward. "The flock of angels is located far, far away from the beach, Primus. The flock of angels is located way beyond the horizon, where the Garden of Eden is located, not here with me and you."

She exhales with frustration at his logic. "I know that too. But you took me, before Teague could have reached me."

He returns back and smiles at her, "Prims, I must apology to you. I didn't teach you about the difference between the demons and the angels, because you were too smart and brave. You didn't need me. Now, you have figured everything out for yourself," Preston turns and stares down at the wounded child. "Look over here! Do you see the spilling blood and the torn angel feathers?" She does not turn and view the wounded angel child but nods in silence.

He continues to stare down at the child angel and exhales with worry. "This body is you, Prims. This body contains your angel blood, your tissue, your cells, your angel feathers that all lie here down on the dry sands here at the beach shoreline. If angel Teague had found any angel body parts on you, then he could've tracked you back to me. An angel can trace you back to me."

She sneers. "You're lying to me again, Preston!"

He returns back and shakes his curls at Primus. "If Teague had found one of your stray angel feathers or your spilled blood protein on the sands or one of your biological foot prints here on the beach, then he could have tracked you back to me, anywhere on the planet, Prims. Caiden monitored all the demon dens throughout the planet. The demon clan is really the set of fallen angels from the Battle in the Garden of Eden." She exhales with fury and then inhales with angry, staring at Preston.

He nods. "But Teague didn't. He didn't find me, Prims. He didn't find any of your angel feathers, but he tried." He chuckles. "I give him credit for that search."

"You're playing tricks with me again. You're twisting the words to confuse me. You're saying Teague wasn't looking for me. That's not true. Teague was looking for me. You're wrong!"

"Teague and some of the angels started to search for you, lamb. They could not find you, not one of your angel feathers, Prims. I found you instead. You were dying, Prims. Turn around and look down at the little tiny five year old angel child with your own eyes, Primus."

She turns and sobs down at the wounded child, whispering softly, "They come ..."

"...not in time, Prims." Preston turns and stares down at the child-angel.

"They come."

He exhales with worry. "Go ahead and touch the child. You are older now and possess a set of good angel skills of telepathy and clairvoyance. You can see your own angel future now."

"No!" She returns back and sneers at Preston. "This is another one of your demon tricks!"

He shakes his blonde curls. "This is not a demon trick, Prims. This is your birth from your first day as a new baby demon."

She gasps in shock and turns to stare down at the angel child, sitting down beside Preston, removing each one of her boots and tosses on the sands. The beach day is heated and hot. The weather is nice and breezy while reminding her thoughts of Florida and the last demon den. She digs and then wiggles her set of naked toes down in the sands, returning back, smiling at Preston. "How goes the war battle go? Who is winning the event?"

He winks at her and wiggles his toes deeply into the sand also. "The flock of dang angels is winning the war."

She gasps. "We, the angels are winning. I don't see how that's even possible. I thought before my demon thoughts had disappeared out from my mind. I thought the demon clan had talked up the upcoming war beating all the angels," she softly giggles.

He smiles. "Some demons can talk, the talk but not walk, the walk."

"But you're the demon leader..."

"...for personal reasons..."

She smiles. "The container of hot pizzas was very clever idea hiding that message in the wet, red tinted tomato sauce. Teague was mad along with my father. How did you convince our two human friends Palmer and Dolly to sky dive from that flying airplane?"

He winks. "That's my demon secret, angel."

She laughs. "We didn't get to consume your set of gifts. Caiden blasted each pizza plus the box into a pile of colorful ashes."

He nods. "Well, that was a good thing. The pizza cheese was toxic."

She gasps. "What! Did you poison each one of the pizzas with bacterium?"

"No. The high altitude air currents had curdled the cheese which probably smelled really bad."

She hears the wounded angel and turns to see the child, returning back to see Preston, exhaling with worry. She returns back and stares at the child, slowly crawling over the dry sands, stopping beside the body. She studies each broken arm, the two twisted feet, and both of her ripped wings, smelling each festering wounds that carry white pus from each deep cut.

She exhales with worry and inhales with fear.

Preston carefully watches Primus, then slowly crawls over the dry sands, and stops on the other side of her, sitting down and stares at the wounded angel child.

She looks up and stares at Preston. He turns and nods to her in silence.

They both return back and stare down at the wounded angel child.

Primus reaches out with her index finger and touches the bloody arm on the child angel, and then experiences a terrible pain inside the child's mind.

***

On top of the wet sands, the wounded angel child could not move from her numerous injures and screamed out loud in pain, shouting out loud for her father Caiden, her friend Teague, her mommy, and any other angel for help.

Below the rolling purple tinted storm clouds, a semi-crooked row of flying red tinted demons had heard a faint voice down on the sands and then turned, diving down on the beach. Each one slowly stood upright and scanned the sands, spotting the wounded angel slowly moving ahead with a sneer. Each one stopped and surrounded the angel child, kicking sand into her wounds and broken body parts, cursing at the tiny angel with a death kill.

The demon leader Preston continued to fly in the sky and then dived down towards the beach sand, landing behind the group while watching the huddle of bloody and tired demons in silent.

"Leave it!" Colee continued to stand and kicked sand onto the dying angel while sneering with fury.

"No, Colee!" Morton stood beside Radium and Colee, reaching out, slapping the arm on Colee with fury.

"Kill it!" Barbie continued to kick sand onto the angel and growls with angry.

"No, Barbie!" Morton leaned over and slapped the arm on Barbie with worry.

"Then, you kill it, Morton." Blaze pointed down at the dying angel.

"No, that's a meanie act." Morton frowned down the injured angel.

"Morton, I love you, baby. But, it has to go. I'll kill it!" Radium reached down and touched the handle on his bloody golden tinted saber with a sneer.

"Don't do this, please!" Morton reached out and touched Radium's bicep.

"Do what, Morton?" Radium turned and winked to Morton. "Do you think I'm going to do something to it?"

Blaze exhaled with exhaustion and wiped the blood from his busted lip, "I vote to kill it, before its angel parents decide to show up here with us on top of this unpleasant beach scene. I'm beat and tired. I don't want another tango with Teague..."

"... or Scooter or Veck..." Radium laughed down at the child.

"I agree with Blaze and Radium. Come on, sugar! Let's leave and find us a cave." Barbie tucked her hand down into his crooked arm with a smile.

"Ich dien, Barbie!" Blaze turned and winked at his girl Barbie. They both leaped up from the sand and flew in a northern direction, soaring away from the beach and the Garden of Eden.

On top of the sands, Colee continued to stand and pulled out her golden dagger, sneering down at the wounded angel child.

Preston continued to stand at the side and growled at the back spine on Colee. "Don't touch it, Colee!"

Colee turned and sneered at Preston, holding her dagger. "I agree with Barbie. We leave and let it die!"

"Don't, Morton!" Radium gasped in sock.

Morton squatted down with worry and reached out, touching her bloody arm. "Don't do what, Morton?"

Radium turned and growled at Preston, "Don't touch it, Morton. Preston wants to touch it!"

"She's only a baby. Look at her tiny hands!" Morton gently caressed the limp, bloody limb with worry and care.

Radium continued to stand and growled with fury at the wounded angel, "A baby angel grows into a bigger angel and then into a bitchy angel. Kill it right now!"

"No!" Morton smiled down at the baby angel.

"Moron!" Colee turned and sneered down at Morton.

He smiled down at the angel. "Morton, my name is Morton, Cobra."

Colee looked down and stared at the child, "It's dying. Do you hear it wheezing for air molecules?"

Radium looked up and tilted his skull, pointing in the southern direction. "I only hear a set of faint voices."

Morton frowned. "They come."

"Let's go and leave it! I wanna go and find a warm quiet cave for the night." Colee replaced her dagger back onto the leather belt on her waistline and rubbed her bloody face with a pair of dried and cut bloody hands.

"I serve, Preston." Morton laughed down at the angel using the same slave phrase from Blaze.

Colee used to wait using her claw and hoof on her guy Preston inside their shared tree house. Radium laughed with Morton.

Colee slowly back stepped from the wounded angel and spun around, moving ahead with a smile to Preston. "Are you ready? I'm leaving from here, Preston."

Preston continued to stand and stared down at the angel. "No! I'm leaving a little later, Colee."

Colee stopped and folded both of her arms over her red tinted, torn tee shirt with fury, "Preston, I swear..."

He turned and growled at Colee. "You swear to what super entity, now, Colee! We have gotten kicked out of our paradise home for following that damn serpent, which was your idea, Colee," He jabbed a finger at the female, since he desired to blame someone else beside myself for losing the war with the flock of faithful angels that had descended down from heaven.

Colee leaned over and shoved his finger aside, reaching out, touching his exposed and bloody chest with a wink. "You liked the idea as I recalled during each one of our secret meetings in the middle of the early morning."

He snorted. "I liked it enough to become the leader of the revolt."

"You and Eve had fought side by side together. I'll never forget that picture," Colee recalled the first strike against the advancing angel as it tumbled down dead inside a fresh pond of water there in the Garden of Eden coming from Preston's sharp saber.

He mouth spat through the air that flew towards her smile. "Newsflash! We lost." He leaned back and then swiftly scooted around Colee, strutting ahead towards the wounded child angel, since he was done with fallen angel Colee and her stupid ideas of an angel rebellion that had failed, epically.

She spun around with a smile and performed a sexy walk while feeling each wound cut and black colored bone bruise in some places that the sun didn't shine, moving ahead towards the back spine on Preston. She was worried that a small flock of attacking faithful angels would show up here at the beach scene for a second war battle, while trying to find the wounded angel. She yelled out loud, "Preston..."

"You have my personal permission to leave the beach setting, right now, Colee." Preston sneered and stopped, starting down at the wounded child angel, standing beside Radium.

She halted with a smile and leaped up from the wet sands, inflating her pair of green tinted wings, twirling prettily in air currents, before landing back down beside Preston. She looked down and sneered at the wounded angel, "If you touch that..."

He turned and sneered at the nose profile on Colee, shoving her from his body. "Begone, Colee!"

She smoothly shuffled sideways away from Preston and stopped in place, swishing her green tinted angel tail in the air, fluttering her pair of green wings that contained streaks of gold and dark brown curvy lines much similar to a snake. She frowned at the back spine on Preston, "Fine! I'll out of here. Don't call me as they say!" She leaped up from the sands and flapped her green tinted wings, flying in the same direction as Blaze and Barbie.

On the wet sandy ground, Radium looked up and sneered at the back spine on Colee. "And don't you come back here, witch, as they say, too, Colee!" He looked down and sneered at the nose profile on Morton. "I never wanna see her green feathers in my nest anymore."

Morton shuffled sideways to Preston and stopped, leaning into the cheekbone on the leader, staring down at the wounded angel. "Please, don't kill it, Preston!"

"That is not my personal plan, Morton!" Preston laughed down at the angel.

Radium continued to stand and stared down at the child. "So, what are you going to do with it, Preston? Are you going to eat it in a raw and bloody fashion? Morton, get behind me, so you don't get smeared with angel blood," he laughed at the mental picture inside his mind.

Preston smiled. "I plan to help it."

"Why would you wanna do that? It's an angel, not a friend of me and you and us," Radium frowned down at the child.

Preston looked up and tilted his jaw line, staring at the pale blue skyline. His pair of sensitive eardrums was picking up in the far distance a set of faint distant voices coming from a band of the approaching angels. The flock of angels finally figured out the child was missing but the band would not arrive in time to save the dying child angel. However, Preston could save her and then he looked down with a smile at the child. "Well, it seems, to me, that we need some new leverage against the fighting flock of new faithful angels, boys."

Morton gasped in shock. "Are you going to use this dying angel child here on top of the wet sands, Preston?"

Radium laughed, "Yeah, Preston is going to use the dying angel child when they come here."

Preston laughed. "Yes, I am going to use the angel against the flock of faithful."

Radium stopped laughed and exhaled with confusion, scratching his goatee. "Do you really possess the power to heal that thing? Her physical body is pretty messed up, Preston."

"She's dying, Preston." Morton whispered with worry.

Preston grinned. "I possess powers that Colee can't even find," he laughed with Morton and Radium. Then Preston lifted up his dirty hand and wiggled his five fingers, materializing a tiny golden tinted satin ribbon in-between his set moving fingertips while staring down at the child angel.

Morton turned and smiled at the pretty object. "What's that?"

He curled the delicate satin ribbon around his dirty fingers and smiled at Radium. "This is a golden satin ribbon which will provide protection for her and me and us, boys." He laughed with Radium.

Morton frowned. "She is only a baby angel, Preston."

Preston nodded. "Yeah, her little advantage will work wonders for my personal plan."

Radium nodded. "Well, it's too dumb of me to every question your personal actions, Preston."

He returned back and growled down at the child angel. "Never do that, Ra!"

"With regard to our current and delicate ex-angel situation here, I wanna understand how you can control an angel. I didn't know how we could do that, Preston."

Preston gasped in alarm and viewed each worried face on his friends Morton and Radium. They had been defeated and then tossed out from their Garden of Eden home along with the other fallen angels that had participated in the war battle against the Creator. Now, each fallen angel must fight for survival using their physical life form along or against the other the wild animals here on Planet Earth.

He chuckled to each friend. "You can't possibility understand, Radium. I have acquired the power by eons of time. So, I can personally block out each one of her current existing baby angel memories within her mental mind and then create a set of new baby girly devil ones which is only associated with me." Preston was a very ancient and powerful ex-angel within the current and active flock of faithful angels.

Radium continued to study the wounded child with puzzlement and confusion, "Really! I didn't you could do. Can you really do that?"

He returned back to see the child and wiggled the object in his hand, laughing out loud with amusement of his goal that will miff out Teague. "The golden colored ribbon can do that for me."

"What ancient talent is that with a girly ribbon?"

"This ribbon trick is a very ancient and old and some not used really baddie angel power," Preston smiled down at the child.

"Why's that?" Morton exhaled with worry regarding evil leader Preston's bad intent and vile personality.

Preston grinned down at the child. "The Accipio method operates like a separate two-lane hiking trail with a grove of tall shade trees and a few water ponds. When an intelligent life form starts heading in a northern direction and the mind gets all mixed up and accidentally starts heading in a southern direction, then the life form performs an 'un-do' or an 'un-learn' technique with your previous learned footsteps or mental mind memories."

Radium gasped in shock and turned with worry at Preston, "I do believe this ancient and not used Accipio method is more dangerous to each one of us, rather than her tiny child self, Preston."

Preston continued to stare down at the child. "This method is not dangerous to the user, which is me. The wounded angel will never know her beautiful angel past but only experience a set of new memories with me, where she and I will learn together ..."

"... for eternity..." Morton smiled down at the wounded baby angel.

"... for eternity..." Radium laughed.

"What will happen here, if she accidentally or purposefully performs a single un-learn technique in front of you or me or him or our new friends, Preston?" Radium frowned at the nose profile on Preston. Radium was an older angel with vast good experiences also. However, he had just learned with a set of painfully results that a concept or a theory or a person or a thing or a snake can change and cause a wrong direction of trouble for every life form that once lived happily within the beautiful and peaceful Garden of Eden. He exhaled with unhappiness and worry, looking up to see the pale blue skyline that reminded him of his lost home.

"As long as the child angel stays with me, nothing will happen, to her." Preston laughed down at the child.

"Why is that, Preston?" Morton frowned down at the child.

Preston grinned and wiggled the ribbon in the air, "Because I'm going to save her damaged and bleeding life form. Then I'm going to take care of the angel for the rest of eternity."

Radium scratched his goatee with his newly developed nervous tick. "I don't know, Preston. Colee isn't..."

Preston looked up and sneered at Radium. "I don't give a shit about Colee. Have you got that?"

Radium looked up and nodded to Preston, "I got it!"

Morton looked up and nodded to Preston also, "Yeah, he and I got it, Preston!"

Radium had been forced to leave his homeland, the beautiful Garden of Eden, along with the Maker's first son Adam and daughter Eve. Every fallen angel was currently seeking out a place of warm shelter, an armful of fresh food, and some type of good protection coming from the raging vile and violent weather elements on top of a wildly developing earth planet. The best solution for each one of the defeated and defiled angels was to stick together and watch each other's back spine.

Radium exhaled with worry, "The pod of fallen angels is not very happy with you, right now, Preston. If the other fallen angels accidentally discover her origins..."

Preston laughed out loud and cut off the sentence structure from Radium. Preston had been a tough and independent faithful angel, who had brilliantly fought beside his friend faithful angel Teague, until the final outcome of the civil war against the Maker. Preston sneered at Radium, "Unhappy with me! Is that statement a death threat on my life force coming from your pair of busted and bloody lips, Ra?"

Radium reached up and gently touched his busted lips, chucking with nervousness at Preston and Preston's wild idea, "No, Preston! I'm too smart for that."

Preston nodded with an evil grin, "That's good to hear going inside my two eardrums." He sneered at Morton. "What about your thoughts or actions of my new idea, Morton?"

Morton laughed with a nod, slapping his chest. "I'm too dumb for that." Preston chuckled. Morton held up his index finger near his smile, "However..."

"Yes, Morton." Preston squatted down near the angel child examining each one of her medical wounds.

Morton squatted down beside Preston and stared down at the child. "You can't strut into our first den..."

"Den! What is a den, Morton?" Preston huffed with annoyance at the younger but mature ex-angel.

He smiled. "Ah! You had missed our first elder meeting, Preston. All the new cast of fallen angels is calling their group of beaten and battered bodies a new name, demans ..."

"Demons, not demans, Morton!" Radium squatted down beside Morton and laughed out loud shaking his long hair. "The cast of fallen angels is called a pod of demons, not demans. We are not named after any human. We do not make any reference to Adam, the man that lost the angel war inside the Garden of Eden."

Morton turned and frowned at Radium, "O! That's why the word sounds so funky!" He returned back and stared down at the child. "Anyways, the new cast with all the newly named demons is flying around and seeking out a series of interior hollow caves..."

"...like a pack of damn sleeping bats." Radium exhaled with annoyance, after the defeat from the faithful angel and then expulsion from paradise, facing a new wilder situation.

"The pod of demons that live inside a cave is calling our new home, a den. So, our home spot should be called a dennie." Morton smiled.

Radium shakes his long hair. "No, Morton. We are a pod of demons living inside a cold, dark den, not a faithful angel living in the bright floral gardens inside Eden."

"O!" Morton frowned.

"But I do see Morton's point of view. You can't just stroll into our new den with a new baby demon on your shoulder, Preston. There will be lots of curious questions..."

"... without lots of current answers from the angry pack of fallen angels," Morton nodded.

Preston continued to stare down at the moaning angel child and smiled. "Then she is a refugee from one of the dead fallen angels. There were lots of us killed today."

Morton frowned. "And there were lots of these faithful angels killed also."

Radium smiled. "Okay! So, is Colee suddenly going to become a loving mom to a homeless child?" Morton laughed with Radium.

Preston chuckled at that non-motherly event. "Colee will never become a mother to a homeless child or her own demon brat. But I do see your point, Ra."

"I can take care of little cute angel." Morton smiled with delight.

Radium gasped in shock and then whined with worry. "No, Morton! You take of me!"

Morton reached out and patted the arm on Radium. "Calm down, Radium! You're still my guy."

Preston sneered down at the child, "Not here, guys, demons!"

Radium smiled. "Morton brings another important point into our current conversation."

"Which is?" Preston turned and nodded to Radium.

He nodded. "Part of the flaw inside our ex-home of Eden, we were all created equal both men and women and man and man and woman and woman."

Morton smiled strokes gently on Radium's big strong bicep with his fingertips. "Radium is talking about us, me and him. We are created equal and we share everything equally more than a pair of blood brothers."

Preston shook his blonde tinted shoulder length curls and grinned, "I understand, Morton. But I don't get your point, Radium."

Radium pointed down at the child. "Our first den shouldn't be equal. I'm guessing you don't wanna to share your little angel find with any demon."

"No, I don't." Preston nodded with concern.

He nodded. "I propose you take it to the elder committee, since you're one, Preston. The new den should be split between a family unit with children and the others."

Morton frowned. "Are we labeled as the others, Radium?"

"Naw, Morton. We are a family unit, comprising you and me." Radium hugged Morton with a smile.

Morton grinned. "Good, I like your proposition."

"What proposition, Morton?" Preston chuckled at the two demons.

"O!" Morton laughed and winked at Radium.

Radium continued to hug Morton and then frowned with worry. "You and I are not going to fit into the family circle with Preston and the other demons, Morton."

Preston nodded with the weird concept and worried about his new plan. "So, where does that leave my newly created baby demon, boys?"

Morton looked and smiled at Preston, slapping his chest. "She can stay with me."

"Morton!" Radium frowned at the brown tinted hair roots on Morton.

"Radium and I will keep an eye on her, for you, inside the newly formed family den, Preston." Morton hugged and kissed his cheekbone.

"Not here, demons!" Preston shook his curls standing nervously around these two males.

Morton pulled back and winked at Radium, looking down, pointing at the child. "We'll become her two pseudo-demon daddies, Preston. We will tuck her two little hoofs in her bed..."

"Angels don't have hoofs, Morton." Radium laughed.

Morton turned and smiled at Radium, "Colee does." Radium and Preston laughed. Morton smiled. "Then we can read her a very scary story before bedtime and make her brush her mouth of fangs ..."

"Angels don't have fangs, Morton." Radium laughed.

Morton turned and grinned at Preston. "Colee does." Radium and Preston chuckled again.

Preston nodded. "All right, Morton! You and Radium can take care of my little angel...demon. I trust both of you."

"Thanks, Preston!" Morton leaned over and kissed Radium's lips.

Preston returned back and smiled down at the wailing wounded angel child, "Watch this, brothers!" He reached down and wrapped the golden ribbon around the left brown tinted pigtail, shuffling his hand, gently touching her collar bone which activated the Un-learneth procedure.

***

On top of the dry sand, in the bright sunlight of heated air, the mental mind on angel Primus quickly flashes into darkness. She gasps in shock and releases the bloody hand on the wounded angel child, tumbling her body backwards and then lands down on her fanny in the dry sand. She exhibits a series of quicken breaths from shock and then slowly sobs with wet tears in fear and fright.

Preston shuffles backwards from the wounded angel and parks beside her, hugging Primus with worry, whispering into her cheekbone. "Are you alright, Prims?"

Primus wipes her tears and then struggles free from his warm hug, spinning around, jabbing a finger into his face, shouting in fury. "I heard and saw everything in the first dream state. You didn't save me for..."

"For what?" He frowns.

She sits back on her two kneecaps and sneers at him. "You had used the Accipio method too."

"The Accipio method is a very ancient and old and not used..."

"Not used!" She slaps her chest and wears fury on her face, "It had been used on me for the past 50 million years by you. You had used it on me, Preston."

"Yes." He nods.

She jabs her finger at him again with a sour frown. "You had used the Accipio method to control me, to block all of my precious childhood angel memories. And it worked, too, on me." She recalls the truthful images and then yells again at him. "You saved me as a leverage piece from my true loving and caring flock of good angels. Now, I understand. Now, I see. Now, I was only an angel ransom note, in case, the flying flock of good angels ever came to here or there and eventually found me. Teague is right. You lie. You cheat. You steal. You are..."

"... an angel, like you, Prims..."

"What!" She gasps in shock. "What in the heavens are you talking about, demon? You are a..."

"...an angel." He nods with a smile. "I do believe that angel Teague has not told you the entire tale coming from the lost and destroyed Garden of Eden, some 50 million years ago. You heard, saw, and felt part of that lost legend during your first Accipio dream state. I and my defeated cast of fallen angels had escaped a death kill from the Garden of Eden."

She gasps in alarm. "What! I don't understand. What are you trying not to say, to me, Preston?"

He looks down and kicks the sand with a clean big toe, returning back to see Primus, exhaling with frustration. "I would like to start at the beginning of everything, if I may, Prims. This is going to take some time. You should sit down and calm down and become very comfortable..."

"No!" She swiftly stands and sneers down over his blonde tinted hair roots. "I will stand right here and tower over your head. So, you need to be very swift, before my angel boyfriend Teague and all of his good angel friends finally show up here and kill you, dead," she sneers again.

He looks up and smiles at her sneer, "All right! I am making the situation a little more pleasant," he exhales with a puff. "The Maker created everything. All of it including the land and sea and air currents around us and all of that above us. But you know that..."

"I know that," she growls and continues to stand over his face.

"The Maker created everything a long, long, long time ago. I really didn't know where the Maker came from or how his powers work, but the Maker did it. Then, the Maker created the winged life forms which looked beautiful and funny all at the same time. The winged life forms didn't have a name. The humans came along and named the beautiful and funny winged life forms. After the winged angels were formed and then freed, we all flew around the universe from one planet to other planet, exploring the universe as we didn't need food or shelter or air or homes to live and thrive. I and my friends were part of the winged life forms, including Teague and all of his buddies including Scooter, Bandy, and Veck. We all lived and thrived happily riding the outer space molecules with peace, joy, and happiness. I guess the Maker become bored and he started experiencing with animal life forms, depositing them down here on Planet Earth. The first batch were ugly and nasty, acid-spitting, fang-killing beasties."

Primus gasps in alarm and then slowly sits down, staring in silence with intrigue at Preston.

He continues to smile at her and narrates his story. "Then, the Maker killed off the first batch of nasty things and started a second batch of new experimental animals that morphed into the ancient land, sky, and sea dinosaurs that reside now days inside a human science books, where each set of bones still remain buried deep down in this dirt, who died here that fiery day, a long, long, long time ago, too.

"Anyways, the second batch of experimental animals displayed mellow, meek, and boring characterizes, also. Then, the Maker came up with a brilliant idea and removed the wings from his success batch of pretty and funny life forms and then he created a man without the wings and magical powers. He gave the man an opposite friend, a woman.

"The man became named Adam. His opposite friend was called a woman and became named Eve. The man and the woman needed a place to live from the dry, heated elements and wet, sandy beach soil, so the Maker created a beautiful, warm, pretty place here on Planet Earth, which was called the Garden of Eden. Since the beginning of time, the group of winged life forms had flocked, frolicked, and played together without a care in the universe as a group of fun friends throughout the universe, his creations, of course. After creating the delicate, fleshy man and woman pair, without any type of magical powers, the Maker had asked, not ordered, some of the winged life forms to come down to Planet Earth and kindly watch over them. Numerous winged life forms had heard the vocal calling throughout the outer space air waves and then swiftly flew away from the other planets, the black holes, the flying asteroids, and other celestial bodies coming here to land and then live down here on the newly developed Planet Earth. I had been friends with Morton, Radium, Colee, Blaze, and Barbie, since our creation together. We all had decided to come and explore the new Planet Earth and see the new creations and new critters coming from the Maker. You should have seen the unique gardens of bushes, groves of tall shade tree, pods of pretty colorful and fragranced flowers, and numerous towering waterfalls sloping down into three different fresh water rivers coming from numerous tall mountain peaks. The Maker had created a paradise. I and my fun friends had enjoyed all the goodies there in paradise along with hundreds of other angels..."

"What about Teague and his friends?" She frowns.

He nods with a wink. "I'm getting to that part. So, inside the Garden of Eden paradise, the angels flocked and frolicked around all the trees and down into the flower beds, without leaving the planet, for any reason or care. And the newly created pair, Adam and Eve enjoyed the new same place and enjoyed each other," he lifts both eyebrows with a deep chuckle.

"Preston!" She laughs.

He nods with a smile. "Now, I am guessing here as I truly don't really know. This is only speculation coming from numerous loose lips of heavenly gossip. The couple pair Adam and Eve didn't possess any type of angel powers or magical powers to protect their naked body. However, inside the interior non-wall of heaven, a terrible civil war had started between some bad angels and the Maker which had swiftly ended badly for one particular nasty angel, who had been cast out from our lovely heaven and then down here on top of the dry, heated, and lonely Planet Earth. Unless you had resided within the Garden of Eve with the fresh water ponds, the bed of pretty colorful flowers, the current of warm air, and the row of fresh vegetation, the outside world was a vile, vicious, and an unforgiving place in your mind and on your hungry body. So, that nasty angel had traveled for miles and miles and miles through the hot, arid, dry desert without a tree branch of fresh food and a brook of cold fresh water and then he had accidentally found the open and unguarded entrance gate into Garden of Eve."

She gasps in shock. "What about you and the others as the current living and breathing flock of angels? Why didn't you immediately destroy that nasty angel? Even thou, I do know his new name."

He nods with a smile. "You're very astute, Prims. Yeah, the flock of carefree, faithful, and powerful angels was located there inside the Garden of Eden while having a ton of fun. But their specific purpose there was to watch over the newly created pair of humans, a man and a woman, who lived there also."

"O dear! I can see the problem and guess the terrible ending for all, now."

"Yes, now, you can see the problem and guess the terrible ending for all. But, back then, no one else could see the problem or guess the terrible ending for the devoted flock of faithful angels. That nasty angel wandered into the Garden of Eden. Paradise didn't have an entrance door with a bolting lock," he laughs with Primus. "When that nasty angel appeared, he was happy to find fresh food and water, enjoying all the free goodies while surviving the harsh elements here on Planet Earth, 50 million years ago. The planet was still cooking and growing inside the volcanic pots of heated lava and downpours of acid rains.

"Back home inside heaven, the pearly gates had been bolted, locked down, and guarded by Saint Peter, Saint Michael, and the rest of mighty powerful arch-angels to protect the interior non-wall of heaven. However, the devoted flock of faithful angels here on Planet Earth had been too busy enjoying each other, producing tons of baby angels, eating all the fresh vegetation, swimming in the fresh river waters. When that nasty fallen angel had replenished his beaten and bleeding body, he continued to wander around paradise without a friend. Then he met a friend and started tattling about some really ugly stories regarding some snobby angels, who all continued to reside in heaven, except for his person."

She gasps in shock. "But, all these ugly stories were composed of lies, fibs, and falsehoods."

He nods with a stern face. "Yes, his ugly stories had been labeled as lies, fibs, and falsehoods coming from a slithering snake," he chuckles. "But, for a devoted faithful angel, who was enjoying their new freedoms, fun times, and fine wine coming from the fermented red colored grapes, each ugly story become a demon tale," he laughs. "The group of powerful arch-angels had been busy getting rid of all the secret spies that had followed that nasty fallen angel and didn't properly communicate with their angel leaders down here on Planet Earth. So, when that nasty fallen angel had showed off his true battle scars and continued to lie about the defeated civil war, some of the faithful angels became scared and decided to side with the slithering snake."

"Big mistake, there!"

He nods with a stern face. "Yes, that executive decision for a faithful angel had been a massive mistake! Some of the scared angels were fearful that the Maker would wave a hand and then destroy the beautiful Garden of Eden, here on his new developing Planet Earth. Then everyone would have to leave warm town and roam around the cold and dusty outer space waves again. The Garden of Eden place was a warm, cozy, and fun spot from the cold, boring universe. So, a group of scared angels started following the fallen angel, who had morphed into a brown and green tinted snake. The other non-scared faithful angels continued to debate with the snake. However, everyone and everything was still in balance here inside the Garden of Eve. Then, the snake got really smart and started following around the two newly created life forms coming from the Maker as the snake had figured out that secret too. The flock of devoted faithful angels had been too busy with their personal fun and was not protecting the newly created life forms there inside paradise.

"Pretty much, everything else is written down like it had played out inside the human's personal instruction manual, the Bible. Yeah, the snake had started hanging down from one of the tree limbs inside the Tree of Knowledge which was a forbidden law for each angel and both humans. An angel or a human could not touch or eat or play around the Tree of Knowledge. Everyone knew that golden rule. Everyone followed that golden rule. However, the newly created pair of life forms, the man and the woman, they were really a pair of newborn babies within the old and ancient universe. I don't know which pair of angels were assigned to protect Adam and Eve, but that angel pair blew their heavenly assignment and then created centuries of chaos and death for every single life form including angels and humans.

"So, Eve met up that snake. Then, that snake had teased and taunted Eve with his evil fun. Then she reached up and touched the smooth silky red colored piece of fruit, eating the juicy apple with a sweet moan, giving the eaten fruit to her man Adam. Well, all hell broke out then, to say the least," Preston laughs.

Primus reaches over and slaps his bruised arm, saying with a sour frown. "That split-second decision by first daughter Eve had turned into a terrible tragedy for all, including angels and humans."

He nods with a stern face. "Yeah, it did. After first daughter Eve had eaten that damn apple, the white tinted clouds had rumbled with tones of very loud thunder and then the earth had shook alerting all the angels of something bad. The Maker didn't make a personal appearance here on the planet, but his loud voice boomed down from the heavens into the Garden of Eden, yelling at both Adam and Eve for eating that piece of forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. The Maker told Adam and Eve to leave their paradise home immediately, as soon as possible.

"Now, I don't know who tossed the first sword and cut off the arm on the first angel. It wasn't me, Prims. But, some of the faithful angels really liked Adam and Eve and thought the Maker's punishment was really harsh and wanted to debate with the Maker while allowing Adam, Eve and all of the angels to stay put and continue to live inside the Garden of Eve. However, the current followers with that nasty snake leader didn't really think but only reacted very badly, attacking a row of unguarded angels, killing the entire row, including the males, females, teenagers, and children angels."

Primus gasps in shock and covers her parted lips, staring at Preston.

He nods with a stern face. "Yep! Then a new civil war between bad and good angels had begun inside the Garden of Eden, here on Planet Earth. The Maker and his row of arch-angels did not interference from in heaven while allowing the new battle to start and then end quickly. At the end of the short bloody fight, Adam and Eve had survived with their life intact as they had been protected by a group of faithful angels with a pair of white tinted angel wings. The snakes had slithered out from the paradise during the war while laughing at the entire mess, leaving behind his dumb followers, who had morphed their pair of white tinted angel wings into a set of blood red hue."

She gasps in shock and studies his red tinted wings, nodding in silence, returning back to see Preston.

He nods with a smile and shakes his red tinted demon wings. Each wing swiftly morphs back into a white hue. He grins. "Then, the Maker had pitched all of the surviving faithful and fallen angels out from their paradise home. Then the Maker quickly destroyed all the dead angel bodies and the entire spot of beautiful Garden of Eden, allowing his flock of selfish angels to roam and survive the harsh conditions here on Planet Earth."

"That doesn't seem fair act from the Maker, to me. I mean, I was a five-year-old kid..."

"... with a stupid father..."

Primus sneers. "That wasn't a nice statement to say, Preston."

"But, it was so true. Caiden was the leader of the entire flock of devoted faithful angels that had believed in first son Adam, who was the victim from his vicious girlfriend Eve. Eve had tempted fate and consumed the first bite. But your father Caiden could have led the angel children, teens, and women back into heaven, but he didn't do that for some reason. I don't know why he didn't do that. You should go back home and ask him that heavenly question," he nods with a sour frown. "The flock of faithful and fallen angels had retained their angel powers and could have survived here as a nest of new beasts. However, the uncivilized battle from the destroyed Garden of Eden actually had continued over the hot beach sands with Caiden. The leader of the good angels and all of his followers including angel Teague and all of his buddies continued to fight and beat and kill each one of the red tinted angels, where I had badly chosen the wrong side. Finally, the group of red tinted winged angels had been branded as a pod of traitors from heaven and then they had run away from Caiden, hiding within the woodlands at first and finally living inside a cave of darkness. The set of white tinted angels took flight up from the heated sands and then landed on top of the cool mountain peaks, making a new home, watching out for a single red tinted winged angel for a death kill." He exhales with a nod. "This was the hidden truth coming from the civil war between two opposing teams of angels within the Garden of Eden. We all were cursed to live and thrive and roam around here with our Free Will, for our disobedience, until our final death day. Yeah!" He huffs out loud with frustration.

"No!" She swiftly stands upright from the sand and frowns down at his hair roots, "I almost..."

He looks down and stares at his naked toes with a smile. "What did you almost do, Prims?"

She stomps a boot toe into the sand and wears a sour frown. "I almost believed you, Preston."

He looks up and laughs at her. "Well, I have told you the demon truth here," he exhales with a sour frown. "Look! I really don't care if you believe me or not, angel."

She tosses both of her arms in the air and wears a sour frown, dropping her arms, slapping her battle clothes. "I don't care, either. So, what is the next step here, demon? I don't fully understand the Accipio method and neither does angel Jazmine."

He winks. "Well, I do believe that ancient and wrinkled old angel Jazmine understands more than she is tattling to you, lamb," laughing.

She gasps with shock, "O really! What more is there to tell, Preston? I have learned through my angel vision from touching that dying child that you are an old and talented demon with a pair of red..." she exhales with frustration, "Look! I just wanna end this demon tale. So, tell me! What more do I need to do here with that child, or that sand, or that whatever, Preston?"

"There is one more last step of the Accipio method."

She exhales with relief and nods with a smirk. Jazmine knows more about the Accipio method and elects to withhold that precious information from Primus, in which, that situation will be addressed upon Primus' return back to Angel Haven.

Primus nods, "Because, I am at the beginning of my birth day as a baby demon. I quit driving the car towards the northern direction. Now, I have turned my car around and am driving towards the southern direction. However, I feel that I have returned back and drive into the northern direction. Why have I returned back to what, Preston?"

"There is a fork in the road, angel," Preston chuckles with amusement.

She rolls her eyeballs and then returns back, sneering at him. "I am hearing more riddles here! I don't want more riddles. I want the final answer. What is the fork in the road, Preston? I wish this stuff was written down somewhere for me to study." She plops down on top of the sand and exhales with defeat again, crossing her legs while feeling both dumb and numb.

Preston quietly sits down and digs his naked heels into the cool sand, staring at her face with a whisper. "The single road forks to the angel side or the demon side. So, you get to pick which side you desire to follow. This is the fork in the road that I had referenced before."

She stares calmly without angry or happiness at Preston. "So, it was you. You had written each one of these yellow tinted ancient paper notes that I had discovered inside the secret storage room there at the Key West USA military base, when I had almost missed the Curfew period during my foot race from Dolly's residential home, that late evening."

He shakes his skull, "No."

Primus nods with a firm tone. "Yes, you wrote that ransom note. Then you had planted all of the hand-written notes for me to find. Each yellow tinted paper parchment had told a tale about an individual who had lived outside the Demon Den and then survived Curfew."

He shakes his skull. "No, I did not. Did you notice a common character within each one of the yellowed tinted paper parchments? Who was real, not fake? That feature should tell you something was correct."

"No." Primus puffs out loud.

He exhales with annoyance. Primus isn't being told the truth of everything by the flock of faithful angels. He nods. "The single character is represented in each parchments was a female."

"So, it was a female. Why is that important?"

He looks down at the sand and shakes his curls. Primus might reject his new information. Or worse, she might start distrusting him. He looks up and nods with a stern face. "These paper notes were written by the flock of angels, who had observed a young girl with a head of light brown hair walking around during the daylight hours. The angel spies were looking for you, Prims."

She gasps in shock, "You did not!"

"I did." He nods with a smile.

"You killed each one of these angel scouts that had been sent there to the Demon Den by my father."

"I didn't personally kill them all. The den of demons does not like or trust an angel, who is scooping around an active and hidden den. That was Teague's fault, really. He's so stupid allowing that bad judgment upon his ring of lousy warrior angel spies. After we had found each of the angel spies, we then had collected each hand-written paper parchment from their cut off hand and then stored them out of eyesight from each nosy or curious demon."

"Why keep providing misinformation to each demon? Why did you store all of the paper parchments?" She frowns.

He waves his hand and nods with a stern face. "The information on the paper was true. It provided some good propaganda for the little banshees. Some of the adult demons didn't wanna believe in Curfew."

She frowns. "Teague told me that you set a group of children outside in the harsh weather elements during Curfew to see what would happen to the kids?"

He nods. "I wasn't part of that terrible demon madness. You were a small child playing inside the demon nursery like the other demon children, Prims. You are my lambie pie, Prims. I voted against that asinine demon act. But I was overruled. I didn't let anything happen to you, Prims. I guarded you with my life."

"You mean to say that both Morton and Radium were my two guardian angels," she laughed. Preston continues to talk about how he had cared and guarded her.

During the daylight hours at the Demon Den, she had been his companion. But during the nighttime hours, demon Morton had been watching over her, tucking her down into her bed linens, feeding her the kiddie dinner, playing a set of demon games, and reading a very scary bedtime story like a demon daddy.

Good thing, Primus isn't a crying demon.

"During Curfew, I can't live inside the family den. I don't marry. I don't have a family unit. I have only you. You are my lambie pie for fifty million years. You are the only family member that matters to me." He nods.

She sneers, "Your family member! I am not a branch of your family tree. I have my own angel family, who I have not seen for fifty million years. You kept me from my own angel family, demon."

He frowns with a nod. "I desire a family too. I desire you as my family. I desire. I didn't to keep or take you away from your angel family for so long. You..."

"You kept me. You captured me. Why didn't you just leave me outside the den in the harsh weather elements? No questions asked. No problems encountered from Teague or my father, Preston."

"I understand now. You get outside the building during Curfew by hiding behind the great big metal gear box then slipping underneath the downward steel door, before it closed shut. That's smart, lambie pie." He chuckles. "No one would see you there, since you're so petite and tiny." He frowns. "Why did you go outside after six pm at Curfew?"

"I..." gasp in shock.

"Ah! It was the stack of paper notes coming from the flock of spying angels. Did you know they were left by the angels? You decided to seek out the angels, is that correct?"

She shakes her curls. "No. I wanted to test the theory of Curfew."

"Well, you are the first lonely and bravest soul. You won't ever catch me out in the evening on Curfew." He chuckles at her successful plan.

"I get the idea from the parchments that told about surviving Curfew. I wanted to show you that you, me, and the demons could survive outside after six pm," she scoots closer with a smile to Preston.

"I shouldn't have listened to you." He shakes his curls with a sad face. "I am so sorry, Prims. You talked about these paper notes. I knew the true story. I just thought you had enjoyed reading them for entertainment purposes."

"The story gave me the great idea to test Curfew. I wanted to prove it. I did it. I did prove, Preston." She smiles.

He smiles. "You did prove for the flock of angels. Your theory is still a little flawed for us, demons, thou."

"I went out for two separate nights during Curfew, Preston." She giggles. He gasps in shock at her new shared information. Primus nods with a grin. "On the first evening night, I had showed you the paper notes there at the school yard when I had wanted us to meet at beachside. Then, before the steel door closed down shut, I swiftly rolled underneath the jagged points on the edge of the door. Then I stood upright from the sands and ran ahead towards your personal window, number fifteen. I had counted the window panes on the side wall during our lunchtime meal while we had sat at the picnic table."

He gasps in shock. "No, you didn't do that."

"Yes, I did. That night, I was sitting directly underneath your glass window with the steel shielding." She giggles with a smile. "Colee was there. You know that I never liked Colee."

"The feeling is totally mutual." He wraps his arm and pulls her closer into his body, wearing a smile.

"I also heard the tenor voice from Blaze with the alto voice coming from his girl Barbie inside your personal room."

Preston frowns. "So, that night, you were sitting in the wet dirt below my personal window pane with that very bad thunderstorm and all that yellow tinted bolts of lightning and loud thunder."

She nods with a smile, "Yes, I had slept during the night inside the hollow tunnel underneath the building foundation."

He gasps in shock, "So, you were located directly below my room floor."

She nods with a giggle. "Yeah, I was there all night long. Then I had gotten soaked from the flooding rain drops leaking down from the floor of wood planks over my head."

Preston leans over and kisses her cheekbone, pulling back with a smile of his eternal love.

She nods with a smile. "Yeah, I was there all night long. My body had gotten soaked from the flood of dripping rain drops leaking down from each wooden plank on top of my head."

He leans over and kisses her cheekbone pulling with worry. "I noticed that. You were sick with a very bad cold, a runny nose, a sore throat..."

"...and green snot, too ..."

"I was so worried about you, angel. Why did you do that, Prims? Did you wanna become sick?" Preston doesn't understand why Primus had left the safe and warm Demon Den.

"No! I don't wanna become sick. I wanted to prove that both demons and angels, meaning you and me could live together during Curfew."

"O!" He exhales with worry and looks down at the sand, wiggling his naked toes, confessing to her. "I had created that Angel and Demon myth, Prims. Everyone played along..."

"What!" She jerks away from his warm hug and then swiftly stands upright on the dry sand, spitting her mouth saliva down in his face, jabbing her finger at his nose bridge. "I can't believe this. Teague was right. You are a liar and a cheater keep me captured with your pleasure."

He swiftly stands and wears a worried brow, extending both arms in the air toward her, shaking his blonde tinted shoulder length curls. "Prims, we all had lived as a flock of peaceful and faithful angels there inside the Garden of Eden. Radium, Barbie, Blaze, even Colee, if you wanna believe that. We didn't wanna become a pod of nasty red tinted demons. First born son Adam was really fun to hang around without wisdom. Then his girlfriend Eve had eaten that damn apple and that nasty serpent had wanted to have some fun with the two humans."

She gasps in shock. "So, why did everyone pretend to like the two humans, if you were all angels?" He shrugs his collar bone in silence. Primus exhales with annoyance and plops back down in the sand, staring down at her naked toes.

He drops down to the sand with a stern face and scoots beside her, leaning into her soft cheekbone, whispering the words, "Inside the newly established demon dens, each demon was kinda acting out with a role. Some of the fallen angels were really upset about being identified as a demon. So, I had proposed keeping the name angels for fun, not fear. Some of the fallen angels had embraced the new name of demon inside the new dark, damp cavern. Thus, everyone was really happy."

"What about the Curfew concept?" She looks up and sneers at Preston.

He nods with a stern face. "Curfew is both real and really bad. Your father Caiden had created the Curfew concept to curtail our demon mischievousness with the humans during our entrapment here on Planet Earth, since 45 million years ago."

She nods. "I was told why the humans believe in vampires, mummies, werewolves, ghosts."

Preston hoots with laughter. "Ah! Those centuries were really good. I still recall some of the funniest activities with the humans especially at the event of Halloween..."

"Preston!"

He frowns. "I am sorry. I apology to you, Prims. You were too young to play those abnormal reindeer games. It was very memorable times for the pod of demons," chuckling.

"I thought Curfew was created for me."

He smiles. "I wouldn't go that far, Prims. Once Curfew had been implemented, these poor demon kids were left outside by their parents or guardians, who didn't care about angels or your father Caiden or his new demon rules. Caiden began spying on each Demon Den on a regular basis during both the daylight and nighttime hours. That was about the time when he had suspected that you were still alive living with a pod of demons inside one of our dens."

"I was living with you."

He leans over and hugs her, pulling back with a smile, nodding. "Yes, you were safe with me. I'll not make pretense that I didn't enjoy our time today, Prims."

She frowns. "Why didn't you take me back to my father?"

"Because, I enjoy breathing air. You can't breathe air molecules during that 'dead and buried six feet underneath the dirt," he softly chuckles.

Primus laughs with a nod, "I do see your point. Alas, it was another lost opportunity for me."

"Caiden had started the thunder and light show around the same time to scare us. The weather show only scared the demon children. I do believe Caiden thought, if he could rattle enough steel doors, then you would be safely returned back to him."

She exhales with annoyance. "My father didn't mention that either."

"I have suggested several times during our private conversation that you have been given only part or partial angel and demon information."

"Yeah, I have received partial information coming from both sides of the demons and the angels. So, please, tell me more, Preston!" She nods with a stern face.

He gasps in worry and slowly stands upright on top of the sand, spinning around, moving ahead toward the ocean waters. He plants both naked feet into the warm waves and stares into the deep blue water. "There is nothing else to tell."

She swiftly stands upright from the sand, follows him at the edge of the ocean water, and stops inside the warm waves, scanning the new landscape with a smile. "Where are we located? Is this a city or town or village?"

"We are located at the village of Mesopotamia. This is the next home for Adam and Eve with all these smelly and biting animals."

She nods. "There is only sand here."

"The basic elements of life, heat, water, sky, and sand for building a city. I happen to know it will prosper." He turns and winks at her. "The Persian Gulf has good fishing grounds, coral reefs, abundant pearl oysters, oil, and petroleum fields that are discovered later in the centuries."

She extends both of her arms towards the sands. "Is this place going to be your next home also?"

He exhales with sadness. "No. I can live anywhere that I chose as long as there is a steel piece on each window pane and entrance door, after six pm."

"Where will you go now?" She inquires sadly.

He stretches his arms and then cracks his knuckles. "I might move and live down under in the country of New Zealand."

"We had never visited there." She turns and stares at his nose profile.

"The weather is cool, since the location is near the South Pole. You really enjoyed the warmer weather which was better for your angel wings. You wouldn't have enjoyed it there, Prims."

She nods. "Yeah, I only love the hot temperatures. The mountain peak has lots of bright sunshine early in the morning and in late evening for my wings."

"I'm happy for you, Prims." Preston whispers with his terminal unhappiness, looking down at the foam and waters around his two naked feet.

"So, what's the last step to break the road block?" She is determined to finish the Accipio method.

"Interstate 65 towards the US State of Alabama is clear of traffic with a road block for the next one hundred miles." He chuckles and then exhales with sadness. "The golden tinted satin ribbon serves to block your angel mind while allowing the creation of each one of your demon memories which have been all destroyed by using the Accipio method. You don't possess any past demon memories to unlearn. You are truly finished. Congratulations! You have succeeded, Prims!"

She gasps in shock and spins around viewing the dying angel child on top of the blood soaked sands, jabbing a finger at the child. "So, this or that or it is really over with and done here."

He does not swing around but thumbs back over his collar bone to the dying angel child. "That is really you at the age of five years old on top of the sands in pain, Prims."

She turns and frowns at his nose profile. "And what has happened to your past 50 million years of demon memories, Preston?"

He smiles at the ocean waves. "I am a demon. All of my past and current mind memories of us will be intact forever."

"And what about each one of their past demon memories, with me, including Radium, Morton, Blaze, and Barbie?" She wonders with curiosity.

He continues to stare with a smile at the calm ocean waves. "It is the same for their mental mind. Now, we are all part of the demon history books. Within you, your set of personal past demon memories has been shattered or cut out of your gray matter..."

"Cut out! Why is my mental mind memories cut out from my gray matter? How is that possible? Why is that needed here, Preston?"

He kicks at the wave with his bare foot and wears a sad face, "I can't believe that your father Caiden didn't tell you this."

She kicks the water and dances side to side in angry, shouting at Preston. "Caiden is dead and turned into nothingness. My father is dead. The war begins. The battle between the angels and demons is still being fought there at Sandia Mountain at this moment. He died inside my arms," she stills in silence and then starts to sob with sadness and depression. Primus had finally found her biological father for four days. Now, he was dead and gone foreverly from her angel life.

He turns and stares with a worried brow at her, softly speaking, "I'm so sorry, Prims."

She looks up and wipes off the tears of sadness, meekly saying. "Go on! Tell me!"

He exhales with worry, "Well, you are still right now a demon girl, until you lose the first memory which includes me. Right now, you are still part of me. We are still a pair of demons, angel," he nods.

"Go on!"

"Well, since you are still a part of me, you still smell like a demon."

She slaps her chest with a nod, "I figured that one out all by myself. I still smell like a Demon."

He nods with a smile. "We, demons possess an odor like an angel."

She leans over and sniffs his arm, pulling back with a smile. "You smell like leather and citrus. It's a wonderful fragrance."

"That odor is wonderful smell to another demon, Prims, because you are still a demon girl. Right now, you are maybe ten percent of a demon girl and ninety percent of an angel girl."

She laughs with a nod. "And my demon smell smells bad to the angels."

"Big time!" He laughs with a nod. "I'm so surprised that your angel boyfriend Teague ain't wearing a gas mask with fresh air molecules," he continues to chuckle with Primus.

She reaches over and touches his bicep. "I bet my demon odor smells like a pit of stinky tar and oil." His arm is warm and exhibits a set of steel muscles that tings her empty mind with a faint memory of tender kisses and gently hugs coming from prince demon Preston.

He laughs. "You smell like a field of stinky tar and cow patties." He hugs her for the last time while storing each one of his demon memories from the past 50 million years.

"My goodness! Now, I understand. Teague had smelled your odor that smelled like my odor, after you and he had fought the bloody fight there in the US State of Texas."

They laugh and then sit together in the sand and ocean water while feeling the cool breeze.

"Yeah, we had fought the bloody fight on Preston Road," Preston smiles.

She leans into his chest. "Were you really there with us at the named Preston Road within the US State of Texas?"

He nods with a smile. "Yes, I really was. This is part of the Accipio method. You pull me into that specific mind memory when you perform the Un-learneth process for any demon memory."

"But you still retained my old demon memory. How can you do that?"

He exhales with worry and turns to face her. "Well, I remember everything about us, Prims. I recall our first time together here and our last time there at the Key West military base and all the demon times in-between. I will always retain and remember you and me."

Primus looks away and stares down at the sand, wiggling her naked toes. "I didn't know a memory carried a sweet smell along with an emotional feeling."

"A mental mind memory carries a tongue taste and a gently touch also. But you have already figured that one out, isn't that right, Prims?" He chuckles.

She looks up and stares at the dying angel child on top of the bloody soaked sands with puzzlement. "What about that thing laying over there?"

He turns and views the dying child, exhaling with sadness. "Right here and right now, you are at a turning point which is the final intersection of your angel and demon exchange memories, Prims."

"Is that why I see the color of black more than a blank, after each one of my past demon memories had been gone regarding you, Colee, Blaze, Radium?"

"Blindness is a more accurate term here. Now, you must decide which intersection you wanna drive down to clear off the road block." He wears a stern face and continues to stare at the dying child

"What am I to decide, Preston?" She slowly stands upright from the water and slowly strolls ahead towards the angel child with puzzlement and confusion within her mind and her heart.

He stands and follows beside her in silence. They both stop and stand beside the dying child.

Preston points down at the child and wears a stern face. "I had found you here in this dying state on top of the sands alone and bleeding. When I had touched your bloody and wounded arm, I had re-charged your energy and your life form while creating a demon life form, in which, I had re-named you as Priam."

"The proper name of Priam means ransom." She continues to stare down at the child.

"The name seemed to fit you. Well, it rather fit your situation that I had created."

She turns and sneers at Preston. "You had blocked all of my angel memories, Preston!"

He turns and nods to Primus. "You were only a baby angel of five years old. The act wasn't hard to implement. I did felt guilty as you grew older, thou."

"Preston!" She frowns. "Would you have ever told me what you did regarding the Accipio tool, my angel father Caiden or my angel boyfriend Teague?"

"No."

She nods with a stern face. "Then, my new demon name of Priam had fit perfectly, since I had been ransomed from the flock of angels for my cause to save the pod of nasty demons."

He rubs the rear of his skull with a nod. "Well, that Accipio method kinda in a way made us become one."

She returns back and stares down at the dying angel child. "That Accipio method made me into a demon life form. So, that means that my child angel form is dying right here on top of the sands? Is that correct, Preston?"

"Yes."

"Can you re-charge my young child angel life form that lies on the sands there?"

He shakes his curls and stares down at the child. "No, Prims. I am so sorry. I do not possess that ability but Teague can."

She frowns. "Teague, he's too young as an angel. Thus, he can't do that, either."

He laughs out loud and then inhales a set of heavy breathes. "Teague is very old, Prims. I've known angel Teague for many, many centuries." He chuckles. Teague has used evil deeds on Primus also.

She gasps in alarm and turns to view Preston. "Teague is eighteen angel years old."

He smiles. "Then Teague must calculate using some different celestial math tables from mine. He is an ancient creature that is the best term to describe his chorological age."

Primus looks up and scans the pale blue sky, mumbling at the clouds, "I'll ask him about that."

"I think you should." Preston grins. The flock of faithful angels has been keeping Primus in the dark also.

She looks down and stares at the child. "I'll be asking lots of new questions when I return back to the mountain peak."

"You're both smart and brave, Prims." He smiles down at the child.

"What do I do next here in the Accipio step, Preston? Jazmine, she couldn't or wouldn't or didn't wanna tell me."

"Jazmine doesn't want you to know. She should have told you the complete ritual process."

"I trust you, Preston. You always tell me the truth. Isn't that correct, Preston?"

He points down at the child. "The angel child is not wearing that golden ribbon. You can see the truth for yourself, Prims."

"I can see the ribbon is missing on my young self. What do I do next?"

"I had touched you when you were five angel years old. Then you had transformed into a demon life form, sorta. Then you had morphed into a unique creature that was part demon and part angel. I didn't ever want to displace your angel side, since you were so sweet and kind." He smiles.

"Thank you for that. I really appreciate it." She sobs with sadness. "Can you convert me into a one hundred demon then?"

"Yes."

She gasps in shock and views Preston. "How can you do that? Why didn't you tell me that? Why didn't you convert me into a one hundred demon from 50 million years ago, Preston?"

Preston shrugs his collar bone. "Fifty million years ago, it was not important. If I had not touched you back then here at the beach, then you would continue to be a one hundred percent angel. You would have stayed in your angel form. Now, here, if you touch the bloody arm on the child, then you will continue to stay a one hundred percent angel."

She gasps in alarm. "What happens to you, Preston?"

He shakes his curls with a smile. "Nothing is going to happen to me."

"Nothing! That's not correct, Preston. You have been exploding into a pile of red tiny fragments and disintegrating within each one of my unlearned demon memories that I had have visited for the past four working days."

"You've been shattering your own learned demon memories, Prims. You can't shatter or cut or take any of mine personal memories, only capture them," he winks at her.

She frowns. "They lied."

"Well, you are here and I am here. I can't touch that dying angel child down there on top of the bloody sands like before. You are still present in your angel form down there also."

Primus looks down and gasps in shock with worry, "Then I'm dying down there on top of the sands as a little kid. Then I'll die and cease into nothingness like my dead angel father, Preston."

He wraps an arm around her shivering body and pulls Primus into his warm chest, leaning down, kissing her soft hair. He caresses her soft cheekbone with a smile and whispers with love. "No, Prims. I will never let you die. I will always be here to protect and love you as long as I live. I promise."

She loves his set of sweet endearments and sniffs his leather and citrus scent, smoothing her set of raw nerves and fearful tensions coming from her active mind. She is safe and protected with Preston. She clears her throat and stares down at the wailing and non-wiggling angel child, "What am I to do next, Preston?"

He looks up and smiles into the pale blue skyline, closing his two eyelids, firmly speaking. "I am calling out to Teague. I can telepath him with your current beach shoreline location here at the shoreline. Teague can come here and save your baby angel body with his set of might angel powers like I did fifty million years ago."

She turns and gasps at his jaw line with love and surprise, "You...you would do that kind loving act for me."

He looks down and gently strokes her soft hair and then her neck muscles when she had been a little demon girl and had become upset by nasty demon woman Colee or another mean demon kid. He smiles, "Yes, Prims. I will do any kind loving act for you. I want you to be safe." She lightly sobs with her rolling wet tears splashing down on his naked and wounded arm. He chuckles. "You're supposed to be happy about this moment in your past angel life, not crying about it, Prims."

"I... I..."

He pats her forearm. "There, there, Prims. I am still calling out to Teague. He will be very relieved and happy to see you again. From what I understand, he does love you."

She jerks from his comfy hug and stands alone on top of the sand wearing a sour frown. Preston stands alone and senses her nasty mood, dropping down both of his arms by his side.

She crosses her arms and shouts out loud at him. "And then what happens to me, demon?"

He looks up at the skyline and as his demon eardrums follow the faint sounds of a band of approaching angels. He returns back and nods to Primus. "Teague, he comes here and saves you as a five year old angel. Then you'll go back and live inside the Angel Haven in the US State of New Mexico with your angel father. Your mother..."

"...is dead. I was told."

He exhales with sadness. "I am very sorry."

She growls. "Did you kill my angel mother, too, Preston?"

"If you trust me, then I did not."

She nods for acceptance. "I want you to trust me, too, Preston."

"I will always trust you, my little lambie pie," he smiles.

Primus flops back down on top of the sands while desiring for Preston to hear why she had caused this demon and angel mess, four days ago. He drops down in front of her and stares at her stern face in silence. She nods with a firm tone. "On the second night of my adventure, I slipped away from Curfew and hid behind the same scrub bush underneath your personal window during the thunderstorm. They came. Then I saw Teague. I didn't know who he or they were."

Preston gasps in shock. "You saw Teague."

"Yes. I wanted to tell you about my daring escape adventure, Preston. I wanted to brag about being outside all by myself within the big bad thunderstorm. However, I did learn that it wasn't safe after six pm during Curfew when they came."

He frowns. "Why did you go outside after six pm for a second time then? Didn't you learn about the dangers of Curfew from the first night getting soaked from head to toes underneath the floor boards in the rain storm?"

"I was collecting data and more information to take back to you about Curfew."

"What for?"

"I wanted to show you it was safe for all the demons and the angels to live together outside after six pm. I didn't mean to break the Curfew rule, Preston." She sobs with her big mistake that has created the angel and demon civil war.

"I don't understand, Prims." He shakes his curls with confusion.

"I wanted us to get married, Preston."

"Marriage!"

She crosses her arms and lightly sobs with sadness and disappointment. "Curfew had separated the demons and the angels at six pm in the evening hour. I didn't want to be separated from you, Preston. I wanted to be with you after six pm. I was trying so hard to prove that it didn't matter during Curfew. We could live together for the rest of our lives. Then we could get married and become a new demon family like the other demon families."

He nods. "Now, I understand."

"Do you really understand, Preston? Because, I don't understand any of this thing. Now, I have really messed up the harmony and peace among the demons and the angels." She sobs with tears of sadness.

"You were outside and hidden underneath the scrub bush in front of my window pane. How were you captured by Teague?"

She wipes her eye sockets and stares at Preston. "I didn't know at first. Then I had realized it was the golden ribbon. On the first night of dusk, the golden ribbon had dropped down from my hair roots and then landed on top of my shirt. I replaced it very quickly. Then Teague had seen the..."

"Of course, your demon aura...."

"My aura!" She gasps in shock.

"The golden satin ribbon shows everyone a façade of you or a false you or a fake demon Priam, not a true angel Primus. The golden ribbon had changed your aura to appear as a demon, not an angel," he smirks.

"And my pink tinted demon wings had changed into hues of pink with dots also." She nods with a smile.

"Exactly! Certain characteristics are embedded within a demon and an angel."

"There are pair of red tinted wings for a demon." She smiles.

"And it is a pair of white tinted feathers for an angel. I didn't change you physically, only metaphorically." He smiles.

"I saw my demon wings as pink coated, not red colored."

He nods. "The ribbon shows you and the others that soft pink tinted feathered image."

"What do you see Preston?"

He smiles. "I see you, the real you."

She gasps in shock. "How can you see that?"

He smirks. "I'm an ancient creature, Prims. I'm an old man when I am compared to your youth. I can see and do lots of neat demon tricks."

"So, you have mentioned before that Teague is an ancient creature like you also. He saw me as me."

He shakes his curls. "Teague cannot. The Accipio method has connected me and you. We are as one as the humans like to say." He chuckles. "Teague, he couldn't find your demon self for fifty million years, Prims."

She laughs. "Right, you are! I was part of you."

"And I was part of you," Preston smiles.

She nods. "And I was hidden from angel Teague. I think that makes him mad at you, not me."

"You mentioned that your ribbon had dropped off your hair roots. Do you mean the ribbon had slipped off your head and dangled around your neck?" Preston nods.

She giggles. "On the first time, the tiny lizard had jerked the ribbon from my hair."

He nods. "Hmm! Yes, that would have caused your angel aura to flicker from red hue into pink tone catching anyone's attention very quickly."

She smiles. "That's it. The first night away from the Demon Den during Curfew, I studied Teague on top of the beach sands. Then, he quickly moved in my direction. The ribbon had fallen down from my hair and landed down on my collar bone. My aura had flickered around me."

He laughs, "Ah! Teague had discovered you."

"No! I had placed the ribbon back into my hair and then I had hidden under the tunnel of the building foundation. Was I invisible?"

He shakes curls. "No, you were just lucky and well hidden."

"On top of the mud and dripping rain drops, Teague had left in a hurry like pronto!"

He grins. "Ah! I can explain that swift maneuver. Caiden didn't allow a band of angels to wander around each Demon Den during Curfew."

"Why not?" She frowns.

Preston exhales with puzzlement. "That is another one of his angel rules."

"Preston, please, tell me!" She frowns.

He inhales the fresh air and then exhales with worry. "Caiden, he had been afraid that some of the faithful angels might have wandered to the fallen angel side, if they continue to mix and mingle too much."

"Why would that happen? I don't understand. The Battle of Eden had divided the flock of angels permanently." She nods.

He nods. "Yeah, we used to be brothers and sisters there in heaven a long time ago."

"Well then, only one or two faithful angels might have come over to the demon side."

"We were brothers and sisters there in the heaven for zillions of years. When first born daughter Eve had eaten that damn red colored juicy fruit apple from the Tree of Knowledge, numerous faithful angels had gotten booted out from the Garden of Eden and also down from heaven."

She frowns. "Why did the Maker boot the angels out from heaven? That doesn't make sense to me."

Preston laughs. "On Earth as it is in heaven, there lies the human characteristics too including envy, lust, sin, jealousy, temptation, greed, fun, entertainment, friends, and family. Pick one or more!"

"I still do not comprehend the punishment method by the Maker." Primus shakes her curls.

"The faithful angels here are fated to live out each remaining angel life while watching over each fallen angel here on Planet Earth as his children continue to trash and abuse Mother Nature. This is our punishment. Teague and merry band of faithful angels are struck there on top of Angel Haven with no other place else to go, Prims."

She smiles. "Teague and his friends can leave and go to visit in heaven."

"No."

She gasps. "So, Teague and his friends are trapped here on Planet Earth ..."

"... along with all of the remaining fallen angels." Preston nods.

"Geez! Teague and all of his angel friends must hate your demon guts." She smiles.

"Presto!"

"Preston!" Primus laughs with a nod.

Preston exhales. "Then each morning, we would receive new members into the demon club consisting of angel family members, angel friends, and the secret angel spies."

"Ah! That would explain the accumulation of the yellow tinted paper parchments, before the American Revolution here in America." She smiles.

He nods. "Teague saw your shiny pink tinted aura as an angel shift occurred and sent your light upwards into the dark skyline. Then he tagged your person underneath the row of light green scrub bushes. He was extremely lucky..."

"No! I was the unlucky one. I had tried to move the big scrub bush underneath your window."

"Yeah, I had recalled seeing that bush tilted sideways for some weird reason but dismissed it. I thought Teague had done that for his fun and giggles. The assigned band of angels are like a scary fairy tale to the group of little banshees when a set of objects move across the grounds without an explanation."

She nods. "I jerked the root system out from the sandy ground while trying to create a hidey hole to spy on Teague. When I pulled out the thick bush stems, I hit the concrete stucco wall with both of my wings."

"Ah! That would explain your set of injured wings."

"During that manual work with my hands and my wings, my golden ribbon had tumbled off my head and landed down on the ground." She nods.

He nods. "So, your aura was like a shining beacon waving at Teague."

"He found me inside the tunnel and then used his angel telekinesis to paralyze my body and then drag me out from the hole. Then he wrapped both of his wings around my injured body."

He laughs with a nod. "That's the good old magnetic moment."

Primus exhales with a nod. "I was captured."

"And the new story begins."

"I snuck out from Curfew to prove that we could marry. Now, I had learned the hard way that we could never marry."

Preston smiles. "We can marry, angel."

Primus gasps in shock. "What!"

He nods with a grin. "You know the truth, part way. An angel and a demon can always marry. This is a common arrangement and then the happy couple lives inside the Demon Den for the rest of eternality."

She smiles. "Really! We can really marry."

He nods. "Now, since, all the truths..."

"... and lies..."

"The lies are squashed. The truth is finally told for all eardrums. Now, we can get married and live inside the Demon Den for centuries, you and me, Prims. But, the only thing stopping us is..."

"... Teague..." She signs with worry.

He nods. "Yeah."

"Can we have demon babies, too, Preston?" Primus smiles.

He nods. "Yes, we can a set of baby demons, too."

She gasps. "We can get married and have a set of demon babies."

"Do you remember the nursery rhyme that you liked to sing around the Demon Den, Prims?"

She starts to sing in sweet harmony. "Baa, baa, black sheep, have you any wool? Yes, sir, yes, sir, three bags full. One for the master, and one for the dame, and one for the little boy, who lives down the lane..."

"Very nice!" He smiles.

She gasps in shock. "Then you started to call me the nickname of lambie every time I had sung that song." Primus smiles.

"Do you remember that too?" He smiles.

She nods with a grin. "Yes! Yes! Yes! Why did you use the word, lamb? The nursery song is clearly about a set of adult sheep, not a group of baby lambs."

"Well, you were a baby sheep. The nickname sheepie poo would have gotten you laughed at. Then I would have gotten mad and destructive and deadly to each insulting demon that would not be breathing anymore." Preston sneers with any harm to his girl and then laughs with a nod. "And you possess an angel's singing voice, Prims."

"Does a demon sing?"

"... off key..." He laughs.

"... like Morton..." she giggles with a smile and then frowns, sobbing with sadness. "Morton, will he come back into the Demon Den at Key West in Florida, present day, if Teague comes here now and touches the dying child while rescuing me?"

"No, Prims. Morton is dead into nothingness like your angel mother and father."

"Morton had cared for me."

"He had cared very much for you."

Primus exhales with sadness. "After I had jerked out the ribbon, I saw that new vision here at the beach with my dying body. Morton had began caring for me while I looked like that all dying and bleeding down in the sands."

"Morton only saw you as a baby, needing only love." He smiles.

"Morton had loved me."

"He had loved you very much so."

She exhales with sadness. "I miss him."

"I do also." He nods.

"He was a good demon to me."

"He was a good demon very much so," Preston repeats with a sad heart.

She gasps in shock. "How is Radium doing after Morton's dead?"

He exhales with worry. "Radium, he is feeling better within that bloody battle between the demons and angels at the moment."

She frowns. "Will I remember you after the last Accipio act has been committed here on the beach?"

"No."

"Will I remember our talk here on the beach now?"

"No."

"Will I remember your laugh today here on the beach?"

"No."

"Accipio is really good." She sneers at the horrible tool of permanent memory loss.

He growls. "Accipio method is very good."

"Strange! I don't feel different, but I do feel different." She smiles.

" The Latin word un-learneth means that every person and thing and place and moment including a thought, a feeling, an emotion, a word, a sentence, an expression is ..."

"... gone..."

He looks up and views the pale blue skyline. The clouds swirl towards the west and the sun slowly sinks down into the Persian Gulf water. "Now, the time is late in the day."

Primus looks up and views the clouds, looking down at the sands and the ocean water, feeling the cold weather. "We have talked for hours."

"We have reminisced for hours." He looks down and smiles at her.

"We have remembered for hours." She sobs with sadness. She will not remember their talk, walk, chat, and laugh when she finally leaves the beach sands and then returns back to her angel home on Angel Haven without Preston.

On top of the dry beach sands, the injured angel child continues to wail, whine, and wheeze loudly as the sound catches the attention of Preston and Primus. Preston swiftly stands upright from the sands and stomps ahead towards the child. "It is time."

Primus jumps up from the sands with a gasp and stumbles over her big feet with worry, following behind Preston with puzzlement. "Time for what? What is the time? Why is the time important, Preston?"

He stops and stands beside the child, looking up at the skyline, closing his eyelids. The daylight is fainting as the horizon of reds, blues, and yellows slowly form before six pm.

She collides into his back spine and hugs his waistline, sobbing with tears. "Don't call Teague!"

He looks down at the child with worry. "You are dying down here, Primus."

"You can go and touch me again." She nods with a smile.

"No!"

"Please, touch the child angel again, Preston."

"No!" He continues to stare down at the wailing child.

She bursts into an array of wet tears and wipes off the tears with worry. "Hold me, Preston!"

He leans over and hugs Primus, tenderly stroking her messy hair, smoothing her heart, and her soul. "What's the matter, lambie pie?"

"I don't wanna leave you, again, Preston." She tightly hugs his tall frame with worry.

He stares down at her light brown hair roots with a stern face. "This is the reason that you came back here to the beach scene and complete Accipio method. You are almost..."

"I love you, Preston." Primus looks up and sobs with her tears of happiness with him.

He gasps. "Do you?"

She nods with a smile. "Yes, I do. Truly, I do, Preston. I love you with my heart, and my mind, and my soul."

He hugs her and then pulls back with a stern face, "Then we need to talk about this."

"No more talking! I am done talking. I love you, Preston." She nods.

His voice changes over her hair roots. "We need to think about this."

She pulls back from Preston and wipes off her wet face, stumbling backwards and then stops a few feet from him in shock. She points at his body with laughter. "You look like Teague. How can you look like Teague?"

Preston wears the face of angel Teague over his demon face duplicating the angel white battle gear and a pair of golden and blue tinted angel wings. Preston speaks like Teague to Primus. "I have lots of demon tricks, Prims."

"Your words sound like Teague too. I'm impressed. Can I do this also?" She laughs.

Preston still speaks like Teague with a smile. "No, only a demon possesses this trick, Prims."

She giggles. "But, how can you change your physical appearance?"

"I have not changed. This face is a façade or a curtain or a cloak over my actual physical body. I am still me. I look and talk different but it is only temporary." He winks at her.

"So, you are projecting a fake person over your real body."

"That's a pretty good explanation coming from a baby angel." He imitates Teague's laughter.

She bounces up and down with a smile and laughs with a nod. "Please teach me also!"

He shakes the black tinted curls like Teague and continues to speak in Teague's voice. "I'm afraid our time is done here, angel."

"Morton had changed into a red and blue clown for me when I had been sacred one night in my bed inside the Demon Den." Primus smiles.

He laughs. "Well, I am afraid to tell you this. But that was his real identity. The façade was his demon image with the pair of red wings."

She drops the smile and then nods with a stern face. "I miss Morton."

"I miss Morton, as well." He returns back into his physical body and nods with a stern face to Primus.

"I loved him too."

He pouts. "And I thought all this time that you only loved me."

"You!" She hugs his chest and smiles. "I loved you first, Preston."

"I'm very pleased to hear that. Morton would be very heartbroken, thou." Preston touches her face.

"Please, teach me that trick, too." She smirks.

"An angel does not possess that nasty deceptive ability."

She pulls back and frowns at Preston. "Why can't an angel do that projection talent?"

"It has something to do with living and breathing at ground level here on the planet."

"I don't understand. I lived here at ground level with you for centuries."

He smiles. "A demon has acquired that particular skill."

She laughs. "O! I get it. A demon had lived together all cooped up inside one of many Demon Dens."

He laughs. "It is more like hiding inside a dark cave or a dark building with the humans."

"Does the pod of demon really live with the humans?" She frowns.

"Haven't you noticed it, angel?"

"Haven't I noticed what, Preston?"

He growls. "The smell of each human."

She nods with laughter. "Yes, of course, each human stinks and smells, making me cough and wheeze from their first-time meeting."

"A demon will absorb those stinky odors that blend and mix with our skin while creating a special fragrance within our leathery skin and feathery wings." He nods.

She gasps in alarm. "I didn't know that. I had no idea. So, I possess a special mixture within my naked skin and on my feather angel wings that is a stinky odor."

"Your skin odor is only temporary which has been acquired through my Accipio method." He nods.

"But, I can smell my body odor." She lifts her arm and sniffs her armpit, pulling back, nodding to him with a smile.

He smiles. "You smell like a bouquet of carnations and irises. A demon smells that lovely fragrance coming from your demon body and your wings, Prims."

"Can't you create that lovely scent for me now like you had created that ribbon?"

He shakes his curls with a stern face. "The golden tinted ribbon is an instrument like a fake body projection. You were only a baby angel, Prims. Projection is a talent within a demon person that is used on the demon body or another human body as a defense mechanism from an enemy."

"Why didn't you project an image over me?"

He exhales with a nod. "Yes, I could have done that. But I was concerned about any and all side effects from my demon talents on a creature so young and tiny. This is the reason that an angel youngling stays with their mother and then lives inside the angel nursery is to protect their baby hind."

Primus chuckles. "Well, no mother or angel had bothered to explain the facts of youngling behavior to me."

"You were only five angel years old."

She frowns. "How did I escape from my angel playpen?"

"Do you remember the angel nursery?"

She shakes her curls. "No. I can't remember any of my past angel memories. And, yes, I did ask. My father wouldn't tell me. Wait! Instead, he chuckled out loud and repeated often: I will teach you to become an angel lady." She performs a raspberry sound and then frowns. "That was the best promise I had gotten, before his ..."

He nods. "Your father Caiden was protecting you and all of your angel memories as a loving father should, Prims."

"Well, I still don't remember with my parents, the angel nursery, or my baby wings. How did I fly through the air at five years old? I was told that an angel can't control their wings at that age. Did I perform an angel miracle?"

He smiles. "Some many questions..."

She punches his chest with laughter. "That you are going to answer for me."

Preston nods and reaches out, grabbing her arm, shuffling them beside the wailing angel child. They both look down and cringe at the bloody heap.

He leans over and whispers over her hair roots. "You were asleep inside your playpen..."

She gasps in shock and slaps his arm with a smile. "You!"

"You were asleep inside the angel nursery, when the war order came down from the Maker. Angel leader Caiden flew down from heaven and met with that rebel human male Adam. You had awoke from a nice nap..."

"Stop exaggerating, Preston!" She growls.

He chuckles, "Then you screamed and yelled for your mother as the angel nurse calmed you down by placing you near the pretty window that was open enough for a skinny little kid to climb up and fell down into the soft grass."

She frowns. "Is there really green tinted grass in heaven compound?"

"Yes, there is. Then you had seen the bigger set of angels moving into the clouds."

"Why would the adult angels move into the clouds?"

He laughs. "They were loading into cloud transportation."

She giggles. "The white fluffy cloud formation are used as a form of air transportation for an angel. Each one of us possess a pair of wing, Preston."

He nods. "Ah! But during a heated battle war, the cloud transportation is utilized to save the wear and tear on the angel wings coming from the heated atmosphere down to Planet Earth during their splash down."

She nods. " I do know my Earth science. Between the thermosphere is the exosphere and mesosphere. The word thermo means heat. The temperature at the thermosphere reaches 4,500 degrees Fahrenheit."

He laughs. "Yeah, that particular layer of outer space is very hot and sizzling like the solar sun for an angel."

Primus frowns. "And then I saw the bigger angels get into the clouds."

He nods. "You saw all of the older adult angels. So, you naturally thought your mother and father was going there also. Then you walked right into the open trunk, which is the rear compartment on the cloud transportation, without any notice from another angel. The trunk clamped shut with you inside which scared you into silence. I mean, it was civil war there in heaven and down here on Planet Earth. A cloud transport is very fast in space. So, each one of the rows of big puffy clouds land on the outside skirts from the Garden of Eden, not inside the garden while planning a surprise rear attack on that nasty serpent and his followers."

She gasps in shock. "I do not remember any of this. The trunk had opened. Then I had dropped down from the trunk and wandered outside the Garden of Eden." Primus turns and scans the harsh landscape. "I had literally wandered here near the ocean water on top of the heated sands."

"You wandered away from the landed strolling towards the rough ocean waters, instead of the floral gardens." He nods.

"Geez! I had made another glorious boo-boo there." She shakes her curls.

"Then you had been attacked by one of these experimental wild mammals ..."

She returns back and frowns at Preston. "What kind of experimental wild mammals?"

His eyeballs darts to the side and as he gasps in alarm. Preston reaches over and cuddles Primus into his chest, wiggling a hand, creating a white tinted shield over their folded bodies.

A few seconds later, a brown and green colored, iguana-looking, ten foot long Euchambersia slowly strutted over the dry sandy ground, sniffing the air molecules for its new lunch meal. The dinosaur mammal possesses a mouth of sharp teeth with a sac pocket of venom on the bottom of the jaw line that bit into its victim, before eating it alive. The mammal slowly moves away from the demon shield that holds Preston and Primus disappearing into a grove of thick trees, sniffing out its lunch meal and away from the creatures.

On top of the sands, inside the shield, Preston wiggles his hand and drops the shield, still cuddling Primus, pulling back with a chuckle. "I meant to say a dinosaur."

Primus turns and stares into the thick grove of trees with worry. "O dear! The pet Dino from the Flintstones television program had attacked my tiny body while I had wandered around the ocean shoreline."

He nods. "You were actually attacked by a vicious raptor with a set of long sharp claws. The smaller dinosaur wanted to tango with you but you didn't know how to dance."

She returns back and frowns at Preston. "How can you make a silly joke about my horrible event, Preston? I was attacked by the little bird with the big teeth and the long claws and then I had barely survived." She eye burns the child-angel in the sands.

"Well, in the skyline, I was running away from Teague and the defeated at the Garden of Eden. I was leading the retreat with my old friends from Eden, when my girlfriend Colee heard your tiny wailing down on the beach."

Primus gasps in alarm. "Colee wanted to eat me."

He laughs. "No. An angel does not eat anything but air molecules. Colee only created a mouth of sharp yellow tinted fangs and a pair of sharp black tinted claws and a set of red tinted foot hoofs for entertainment purposes, Prims." He chuckles at the mental picture of Colee.

"I really hate her now." She sneers.

"Here on top of the nasty weather and the wet sands, you were crying out loud in pain and hurt while laying without motion of the heated sands. So, we all dive down and landed on top of the sands, veering in your direction to investigate." He nods. "I didn't know your name, until I had touched your bloody arm with my angel healing powers. But, we were all certain of your origins displaying a pair of broken pink tinted feathers and a tiny white colored dress."

"Thank you for not leaving me!" Primus lightly sobs with a nod. Now, she knows the truth.

She had been the one to leave her protective heavenly angel nursery while searching for her two parents as a tiny innocent act that had turned into a terrible tragedy for both of her angel parents. Back at Angel Haven, Primus had been asking over and over again for the truth from her father without understanding his fatherly guilt.

Preston smiles. "You are most welcome, angel."

"Wait! Can you project a colorful picture of my dead angel mother for me to see on your physical body, Preston?" Primus smiles.

Preston shakes his blonde haired curls. "No."

She folds her hands and nods with a smile. "Please, pretty please, Preston!"

He continues to shake his curls with a stern face. "I did not meet your biological angel mother. Therefore, I cannot project her angel image over my body."

"But I didn't have an angel memory of her either. Bummer!"

"I bet your mother was pretty like you, Prims. You don't favor the likeness of your father Caiden in my opinion." He grins.

"Yeah, you're right. I didn't think about that family trait. I do look my mom. That answers another wandering, pondering question." She nods with a smile.

"Good!"

She frowns. "But I do have lots more questions. You have met my father and Teague..."

"...Scooter, Veck, Bandy, Jazmine, and all the other faithful angels, since the pod of demons have encountered them from time and time, before the Curfew rule."

"What do you mean before the Curfew rule? I don't understand."

"Curfew had been created to contain the antics from the pod of mischievous and angry demons that were running amuck as a set of free spirited and freely haunted on each human."

She nods. "Yeah, you had mentioned that before."

"That's how we met the flock of good angels. Teague is the commander of the scout troops that enforces the Curfew rule."

She frowns. "Yeah, you had mentioned that before too."

"We had learned about the remaining angels when the faithful ones had defected and lived within each one of the established Demon Dens."

She frowns. "Yeah, you had mentioned that before too."

He frowns. "Is there a problem here, Prims? You keep repeating the same sentence structure."

She nods with a stern face. "I am quickly learning and validating all the shared information from the flock of angels."

He laughs. "Ah! You're comparing my notes to their notes."

"Something like that!"

"Prims, didn't try to find a heartache when it doesn't exist?" He frowns.

She gasps. "What does that strange statement mean, Preston?"

"When the war order came down from heaven to attack the Garden of Eden, angel leader Caiden had to obey. Losing you how to be devastating for him. If I had been a biological father, then I would have torn the planet apart looking for my daughter."

"But you had found me in seven days." She frowns.

"No."

"Yes, I left you on last Wednesday at six pm. Today is Thursday. You had found me in seven days with your limited resources." Primus praises.

"Humans are not limited." He laughs.

She smiles. "How did you con human male Palmer and female Dolly to go into that airplane? Palmer was always scared of his own shadow."

"He found a bigger shadow." Preston laughs.

She gasps. "Preston, did you threaten that human boy?"

He shakes his curls with a smirk. "No, I cast a spell on the human male."

She gasps again. "You had cast a spell. Can we really do that?"

He nods. "Yes, a supernatural being can cast a spell. Spells are part of their supernatural body. When you cast a nasty or lovely spell, you then lose some of your supernatural powers and some of your own components of your physical body."

Primus frowns. "Why's that?"

"The depletion of your powers and your physical body occurs keeping the supernatural creature intact and their evil ways abated against the humans or another pod of supernatural beings." He nods.

"Demons are a pod of evil creatures."

"Demons are a set of fallen angels, who are trying to survival here on a hostile world with the rest of the faithful angels, who continue to chase after their own tail feathers above the skies and over the terrain," he laughs at the truth.

"Touché!" She laughs.

"Dolly and Palmer had returned..."

"... back there to Key West military base and then told all of our angel secrets." Primus gasps in shock.

He shakes his curls with a grin. "Their two active and independent human minds had been wiped blank regarding the flock of beautiful angels, home of Angel Haven, and the skydiving trip."

Primus sneers. "Jazmine did that. I didn't know how, but she did that."

"Ancient and old angel Jazmine performed more of her nasty angel spells on the two humans."

"Terrible! She is a very horrible and terrible angel." She nods.

"I and the other demons have known about village Angel Haven from the defected one. However, until the current civil war of angels and demon had broke out here, there was never a need to visit for any type of recreational hiking or hang gliding or gutting the wing off an angel." Preston laughs.

"So, what took you so long to arrive there at Angel Haven?"

He gasps in shock. "Uh! What took so long?"

She slaps her chest and smiles. "To come and get me, silly boy! You saw Teague during his flight off the wet sands of Key West military base. You had known the secret location of Angel Haven. You saw me from your broken glass window inside your room." Preston looks down and views his dirty hands. She yells with fury, "Preston!"

He looks up with a stern face. "I... I..."

"Preston!"

"You were back there with the flock of angels and your father Caiden and your boyfriend angel Teague. You were an angel, Prims. You belonged with the angels." He confesses.

"Preston!" She exhales with disappointment, sadness, and fear of losing him forever.

"I didn't know, if you cared for..."

She leans over and kisses his lips, pulling back with a smile, "Preston, I love you."

"Prims, you were only a baby angle, when we had met the first time. Now, you are an intelligent and brave and beautiful angel, after the past four days from the Accipio method. You have grown up and matured from that terrible process. Caiden would be proud as your father."

She leaps up from the sands and jabs a finger into his face. "So, you forgot all about me there at Angel Haven in a blink of any eyelash. You forget me." She crosses her arms and sneers at him.

Preston swiftly stands and shakes his curls. "No, Prims! Never, Prims! I have never forgotten about you. You were with your kind, kinder flock of angels. They would love, care, and protect you."

"They would love, care and protect me." She turns and spits down on the dry sands, returning back, sneering at Preston. "Yeah, they cared enough by forcing me to perform that Accipio method that wiped out all of my memories."

He slaps his chest with a stern face. "I had performed the Accipio method on you too. You should be mad at me, when the angels told you what I had done. I did keep you with me for fifty million years and away from your angel flock. I shouldn't have done that, but I did. You should be mad at me, Prims."

She sneers, "Do you wanna know what happened to me when I had met the loving, caring flock of good angels? Do you really?"

"Yes."

She stomps her naked foot in the sand and growls at Preston. "I was told and ordered and commanded to perform that Accipio method. I was given no choice, but to obey my father." She sobs with wet tears of sadness and angry.

"Prims, that was the only way for you to forget me."

She jabs a finger at his face. "You were not a threat to them. Believe me! I heard that statement over and over again. You were not a threat to me either. You're right. I was protected, guarded, and secured with them. I couldn't move or breathe on top of that mountain peak without Teague escorting me everywhere. I was an un-caged angel prisoner. My father even locked me inside the tower building, so I couldn't fight in the civil war."

He gasps. "Why would you wanna fight against a mature demon, Prisms? You don't know how to fight against anyone."

She waves her hand and nods with a stern face. "That's beside the point. No! I didn't wanna fight, I desired to talk with you."

"Well, I wanted to see you, also." He nods.

She nods. "That's good to know."

"Well, the Accipio method has served many purposes, Prims. For me, the method has tied you back to me. For the flock of angels, the method has un-tied me back to you."

"It sounds like you are tying a pair of shoe laces. I can do since five years old."

He nods. "That's what they wanted you to do, Prims."

She dances side to side in angry and wiggles her limbs in the air. "Right-o, buddy! Ding! Ding! Ding! You win the grand prize. They wanted it. The flock of good angels wanted me to lose you and all of our memories together."

"That's the purpose of..."

"You're not listening to me, Preston. They wanted..." She halts with sadness and then sobs with her tears, wiping off her eye sockets, whispering the truth. "They ordered me to lose all my memories."

He nods. "All of your memoires were a set of demon memories. You couldn't access any of your angel ones."

"I don't care about the old five year old angel memories, Preston." She sneers and continue to wipe of the tears.

"You do possess five angel years of life before your new demon girl life, Prims."

She stomps her feet and sobs with tears. "I wanted to keep all my memories even all my demon memories. These are my memories. The demon and angel memories all belonged to me." She bursts into wet tears and cries loudly.

Preston leans over and hugs Primus, smoothly stroking her hair roots, closing his eyelids in sadness too. He completely understands now.

Primus had been treated badly by the flock of angels, but he had used the Accipio method to save her life from an evil plan that had been formulated 50 million years ago which had created her long term demon memories by default with his demon life.

The flock of angels had selfishly used the Accipio method and then erased her past, the only past she had lived and loved. This had not been her choice but her force of a choice from her loving father and angel family.

He pulls her tightly into his chest and slowly sobs with his tears of sadness. The damage has been done. There is no going back for Primus or Preston.

Preston whispers. "I am so sorry, Prims."

"I am sorry too. I just wanted to be happy." She sniffs up the snot and tears.

"You can be happy, Prims. I can call Teague."

"No!" She yells out loud and jerks away from Preston, standing alone, sneering at his face. Then she stills and views his tears of sorrow and regret for her torture and her torment by her own angel family.

"What are you going to do, now, Prims?" He nods with a sad face and wipes off the tears.

"What are we going to do, now, Preston?" She smiles and wipes off her tears.

"We!" Preston gasps in shock.

She exhales with confidence. "Preston, I am not going back to live with the flock of nasty angels. I have learned too much that I don't like about them. They place a nasty spell on the human teens for fun. They didn't leave the mountain peak, except for demon torment. They're arrogant. They gossip."

"They fight with the demons."

She nods. "They fight all of my demon friends."

He frowns. "Prims, the flock of angels do what they must to survive and live here on Planet Earth. I want to you understand their evil intent, even if it does appears odd."

"You have mentioned that three times before. They must survive on Planet Earth. Can't the flock of good angels fly back into heaven?"

"Never!"

She gasps. "Never? So, Teague and his angel friends are stuck here on Planet Earth."

He nods. "Give the man a break here, Prims! Teague is stuck with you and me here on this polluted and carbon-filled trash pile as the race of greedy humans keep destroying the pretty rain forests and poisoning the water system along with murdering every kind of beast. Teague is smart. He wants you by his side as he lives and breathes for the rest of his days here on Planet Earth."

She nods. "I concede your point. But how about that dang smell?"

"What smell does an angel or Teague exhume into your nose holes?" Preston laughs.

She slaps her chest. "No! What about the smell from me as an angel?"

"You smell like a demon to me. And I love your smell, Prims." He leans over and sniffs her sweet fragrance, pulling back with a wink of happiness.

"How about Teague's angel smell?"

He laughs. "I do not care about Teague or his smell or his sword."

"Teague is a good swordsman." She nods.

He slaps his chest with a nod. "I'm better."

"He's a good protector."

"I'm best."

"He's a good angel." She laughs.

"I'm the better angel." Preston winks.

"Yes, you are all of that and above," Primus laughs and then frowns. "And what about Radium? He hates me. I caused Morton's death."

He sneers. "No, you did not, Prims. Teague and his band of nasty angels had killed Morton. You didn't carry a sword. You don't own a sword. You have never used one. Radium is a warrior demon and he knows the difference between the innocent and guilty."

"And what about nasty demon girl Colee?" She sneers.

He laughs. "Colee is a she-devil. She was born that way and will stay that way. Everything is her way or the highway."

"How you seen her lately?"

He nods. "Yeah, she had tried to wiggle like an earthworm back into my life using her poor sympatric routine, after your untimely and surprised angel capture. It didn't work. So, Radium got really mad and kicked her tail off the Key West military Naval base. She has been wandering the forests for days now."

"Why does she have a green tinted demon tail?"

He laughs. "No, I meant her fanny."

She nods. "I saw Colee in that vision here. She had displayed a cat-like, green colored demon tail that was parked on her fanny here at the beach."

Preston laughs. "Yeah, inside the Garden of Eden, each fallen angel that followed that nasty snake had created that as part of the new demon myth. Before Caiden had arrived with his flock of faithful angels, the un-faithful angel had selected a mascot..."

"The mascot was a tail?"

"Yeah, the flock of goody-goody angels who didn't wanna join our band had sent in a set of spies among our un-faithful troops, so we had created a physical mascot as a secret sign that was known only between each true demon."

"So, did it work?"

He laughs. "Yes, it worked out very nicely. We got rid of numerous annoying ..." he exhales. "Never mind."

She giggles. "So, where is your non-furry tail located on your physical body, demon?"

"After a few centuries of fun with the race of stupid humans, the pod of demons pitched the tail and updated their social image with the current clothing style." He grins.

"Did I get a tail too?"

He nods. "Yes, my lambie pie, I had created a tiny baby coral ball of bunny fur on your dress."

"Did you really?" She gasps in alarm.

"Yes, I can show you, some day." He smiles.

"Can you really do that, Preston?" She frowns.

He raises both eyebrows with mischievous and an evil smile. "I possess lots of demon tricks, Prims."

"I love you, Preston." Primus leans over and hugs his torso, laying her skull onto his chest.

His skull turns sideways and leans down, touching her hair roots, whispering for her eardrums. "I love you, Prims."

She struggles sideways and pulls back, smiling at Preston. "And what is going to be my name now?"

He nods, "Prims or Primus, I like that name much better than Priam."

"That's a fake name. Prims is a real name and a real girl which is me. So, where will we go to live now, Preston?" She looks up and scans the sky for the band of advancing angels.

"I believe we can end all of this right now, Prims." Preston looks up and scans the dark sky also.

She looks down and stares at his face. "What! How can we end all of this right now, Preston? The time is almost the Curfew rule. They come here to capture you. We must leave right now."

He smiles. "Yes, I came here and captured your heart. We can end the Angel and Demon War. We can live together forever, Prims." He leans down and kisses her lips, pulling back with a smile.

"Will I become a demon?" She nods.

"Yes, I will make you a one hundred percent demon. How does that sound?" He smiles.

She frowns. "How will I become a one hundred percent demon, Preston?"

"You'll love it. We go and get married. Then we go and get our own Demon Den. Then we live happily together, every day and every night, foreverly..."

"And we will create a child."

"Yes, we will have a bunch of little baby demons. I love you, Prims."

She exhales with worry. "Well, I have lived with the Curfew rule for fifty million years. I can live with the Curfew rule for the rest of time with you and all of my little demon babies."

Preston looks up and scans the semi-darken skyline. "I don't think we have to worry about the Curfew rule anymore."

"Of course, we do. The time is getting closer to six pm. We must leave the open beach and find a place of shelter, Preston." She turns and scans the wild landscape for a new cave mouth.

"I have inkling." He continues to scan the stormy skyline.

"My father had used the Curfew rule to search for my person and then penned all the demons indoors and..."

"... other stuff," he looks down and smiles at her. "Now, that has all changed. Everything has changed, Prims."

She returns back and smiles at Preston. "I have changed. I don't posses any more of my past demon memories. I don't remember what had happened after I had left the Key West Demon Den other than the numerous encounters with Teague and the other angels at the Angel Haven village."

He nods. "These are the start of your good memories."

"I clearly recall meeting my father for the first time and attending the Festival of Flight, the celebration dance. But my fifty million years of memories are..."

"Lambie pie, we will work together and create all new memories with me and you. There will be no more Curfew rules or other demon dens, if you request so."

"What! I liked living in the family den with the other demons. I just wanted you to be there too with me."

"I'm glad to hear that." Preston smiles.

"Preston, I don't wanna see Teague, again."

"Do you know what you're saying with me?" He frowns.

"I do, Preston."

"Do you know what you are asking of me, with me, for me and you?"

"I do, Preston."

"Do you know what this means for me?"

"I do, Preston."

"Well..." Preston smiles.

"Well, what?" Primus frowns.

"You seen to have the I do part correct." He laughs.

"I do wanna spend the rest of my eternity life with you ..."

"... as a demon..."

She nods. "I do as a demon."

"What about the smell from each demon?" He laughs.

She frowns. "A demon didn't smell to each other."

He leans down and hugs Primus as the daylight turns down into a red, pink and blue colored sunset. The dying angel child mews loudly and grabs the attention from Preston and Primus. He releases Primus and shuffles backwards, swiftly moving ahead towards the injured child and then stops beside the dying body.

Preston points down to the child. "I must touch the angel child."

"What will happen to that thing?" Primus points down at the ugly thing.

He squats down and drags Primus beside him. "The child will be restored back into full health as a cute little five year old angel girl."

"Where is the golden ribbon? I need the ribbon before I can perform that act."

"No, there is no need for the golden ribbon. I want you to see the real world and the real set of demons." Preston nods.

"The real set of demons, are they different from me?"

"The demons are the same. You will be different to them."

She gasps in alarm. "Then they will know that I'm really an angel."

"Yes."

She gasps in fear. "Then I'll be..."

Preston hugs her and stares down at the dying angel child. "You are with me, Prims. Absolutely nothing will happen to you. I promise. Do you believe me, Primus?"

She stares down at the child. "Yes, I do believe you, because I trust and love you, Preston."

"We'll get married today."

"Really! Will we really get married today?" She smiles down at the child.

"Within the hour, I promise."

"Where will we get married, Preston?"

"First event, you must touch the angel child."

She gasps in worry and smiles at Preston. "Will I get all my demon memories back?"

"No, Prims. Your demon memories are foreverly lost." He continues to frown down at the wailing child.

She gasps in alarm. "Wait! After I touch the child, I will be transported back into heaven. You can't come back into heaven. I don't wanna do this, Preston."

Preston turns with a wink and softly chuckles at her frown. "No, you are not allowed back into heaven like me and Teague, either. But you are very close to correct. You will be transported back to Angel Haven with Teague and his fighting angel friends and my fighting band of demon friends."

She gasps in worry. "How will I find you among the fighting demons, Preston? I don't wanna do this thing."

He reaches out and grabs her hand, nodding with a smile. "I am holding your hand with my love. Do not let go of my hand! Then we will both transport and stay together, always and foreverly. No one will separate us again, Prims."

Primus nods with a smile and looks down at their cupped hand, turning to view the wailing child, reaching out. She taps the bloody collar bone on the screaming angel child.

Both Preston and Primus drop down from the skyline like magic and then land on their kneecaps on top of the hard rock surface without a pod of pretty soft flowers in front of the single wooden railing that keeps an angel kid from tumbling off the 13,000 feet mountain peak down into the flat desert floor.

He yells out loud in pain and then quickly stands in more pain, leaning down to grab Primus, scanning the new and unfamiliar landscape of Angel Haven with worry. He stands her inside his chest for protection and continues to monitor the quiet air waves with caution. Preston asks. "Prims, are you alright? Is your angel body hurt?" He looks up and views the war that has drifted off the Sandia Mountain peak into Angel Haven with worry.

"No, I'm fine." She continues to suck in and out fresh molecules of oxygen from that scary ride through the atmosphere before landing back at her angel home while scanning the environment for Teague and his angel friends of Scooter, Bandy, and Veck. She looks up with a gasp and views the fight as each wing tip flashes side to side in victory or defeat. "The war has moved from the Sandia Mountain Range to here inside Angel Haven."

Preston growls at the intense fighting in the skyline. "The demons must be winning the civil war. Else, the flock of angels would not be retreating back home to their village for safety, which is a stupid plan. The band of demons will follow them and then kill all of the angel children. Bad blood runs thick through each demon vein right now."

Within the pale blue skyline, angel captain Teague continues to fight against three brave and smart demons while trying to fly backwards away from Sandia Mountain peak and move back toward his angel home. He has received some very bad news of a band of demons there tormenting the angel kids.

Teague finally kills the last of the three demons with his sword and as the blood proteins cover his battle chest and naked arms with their blood, feathers, and bones. He hovers in the air over the landscape of Angel Haven and looks down with a gasp, seeing a pair of red tinted demons on the rock surface. "The time is Curfew, ya'll!" He shout out loud with his angel yell at his fighting angel friend Scooter.

In the same air but miles apart, angel Scooter kills two demons and halts in the air currents, wiping off the blood and body parts with a sneer.

Veck and Bandy destroy the set of demons and fly ahead toward Teague.

Teague motions down at the rock surface of pink hue inside Angel Haven. "I see two more demons. And since it is Curfew hour, let's go and have some fun with the pair." He leads the dive down to the mountain peak with his friends on his tail feathers.

On top of the pink tinted rock surface, angel Primus continues to scan the village and views each building with a smile of happiness. "Wow! That Accipio method is powerful. You were right, Preston. I touched the child which was me and we both landed back here on Angel Haven."

Preston spots a flock of angels in the skyline and wears a stern face of worry. "We must find Teague and then end this war right now.

She continues to scan the empty compound with a smile. "You could've sent an email of modern communications telling Teague to end the war from us while we are exchanging our marriage vows, Preston. I know Jazmine has a problem with the solo thing. She would have gotten the electronic message both figuratively and literally and then she would have passed it on."

"Teague has to be told in person."

She exhales with annoyance. "Teague is not going to listen to you, Preston." Teague will not harm Primus but demon prince Preston.

He views the flock of angels and recognizes angel captain Teague. "You're so right. Teague will only listen to you, Prims." Preston spins around her and leans down into her face. "Teague must listen and end the war. Then each demon and angel will feel safe, secure, and happy for once in their miserable life and live for loving future like us, Prims."

"Yes."

"You must tell Teague..."

"... to end the war between the demons and the angels and then make peace."

"You got it, kid!" He laughs. "The war isn't as important as..."

"As what, Preston?" She frowns.

"As you are to me, Prims."

"I don't understand, Preston." Primus shakes her curls with confusion.

Preston exhales with a nod. "You must tell Teague that you have chosen me also," she struggles side to side with worry and wiggles from his hug, standing alone with worry. "So this is why we are back here, not the war, but..."

"... you ..."

"Me!" She gasps in shock.

He moves ahead and hugs her, whispering into her face with worry. "Prims, you must tell Teague what you wanna do and where you wanna go, and who you wanna become. Only then he will leave you alone."

She nods. "So, this war is really about me. This Curfew rule was about me. These parchment notes were about me."

"Yes." Preston nods.

"I didn't want any of this." Primus shakes her curls and stares to cry.

"And my current demon girlfriend didn't want me to save a little angel either." He smiles with happiness.

"But you did anyways." She smiles between the tears of worry.

"Sometimes, you do what is right, not what you want."

"I want you, Preston." She leans over and hugs him, lightly sobbing with both happiness and relief but dreads seeing Teague and breaking his heart.

"That's right with me, Prims." Preston chuckles with a grin and cuddles her, staring at a band of faithful angels that have landed directly in front of them.

Within the cold and calm air waves of a bright sunny day, Teague flies in surprise and gasps in shock, viewing the flat desert of numerous folded and crumbled dead creatures consisting of disintegrating demon and angel bodies. This is why a human never see an angel. A dead angel slowly dissolves into nothingness. Within a few more hours, all the dead supernatural creatures will become part of the pink soil and then will disappear into the air currents.

His body dives down from the row of thick, wet clouds and as his eyeballs dart and survey the village. Then Teague gasps in shock again and then snorts with fury, turning upright in the air waves, slowly landing down in front of the wooden railing, where a pair of red tinted demons cuddle in love. He stands upright and sneers at Preston.

His angel friend and warrior brother Scooter lands down on the right side of Teague. His other two angel friends Veck and Bandy settled on the left side of Teague.

From the Training Tower, Jazmine flies from the highest window which is Primus' bedroom suite and soars through the air with a sneer at the sight of demon prince Preston, and then lands down beside Scooter.

A row of sneering angels stare at Preston and the tiny body of a female demon.

Teague shouts out loud with a sneer. "Caiden! Where is he? Where is Caiden?"

Within the cuddle of Preston, Primus recognizes his smell and his voice, feeling his heated envy, hatred, and jealousy coming out from angel Teague more than the other angels. Over the four days and night, she had re-learned numerous tales of Angeldom which had also imitated the Demon Lore that came from the fallen angels. How interesting!

Primus releases Preston and spins around, sneering at Teague. "My father is dead."

Teague gasps in shock with the other angels and turns to view Jazmine in silence for confirmation. She turns and nods at Teague in silence with the death acknowledgement.

On top of the pink tinted rock surface, Preston continues to hug Primus when a line of demons land down and protect their demon leader consisting of Blaze, Barbie and Radium. Each demon stands and growls at the line of angels.

"Caiden is dead by them!" Teague jabs a finger at Preston along with a growl of fury.

"My father is dead by you," Primus jabs her finger at Teague.

"What!" Scooter gasps in shock. "What has gotten into your brain cells, angel?"

Primus exhales with frustration and sadness, waving both arms through the air. "All of fighting is a waste of time and energy and resources for everyone including me and you and my dead father. The pod of demons did not want a war. They want peace like the flock of angels, Teague."

"Primus, please!" Teague reaches out with both hands at her and shakes his black tinted curls.

She back steps into the chest on Preston and shakes her curls with a stern tone. "No more, Teague! I want to have peace and harmony with the demons too. And I want all of my personal demon memories back too. But that can't be changed, can it, Jazmine?"

"Each one of your vile and nasty demon memories must be lost in order for you to become an innocent angel again." Jazmine sneers at Primus and turns with a sour frown to view Teague, nodding with a growl. "I told you before that she would resist her angel duty, Teague. She has gotten her father Caiden killed, because she wouldn't or didn't want to finish the Accipio method and remove her last demon memory."

"Shut up, Jazmine!" Teague turns from Jazmine and stares with worry at Primus.

Primus slowly steps away from Preston and moves closer to Teague, nodding with a stern face. "Please, stop the war, Teague. You are the leader of the flock of faithful angels now. They will obey your command."

Jazmine sneers with fury for failing her lover Caiden, her angel student Teague, and most of all for failing her person, since she has underestimated the little wicked demon girl. She growls with angry, "Primus, how did you escape from the Tower building? Why are you here with that demon male?"

Preston leans down and whispers the words into the cheekbone on Primus which is heard by each angel and demon. "Tell him, Prims!"

Teague gasps in shock. "He called you Prims."

Jazmine laughs with annoyance. "They are..."

"I love Preston." Primus nods with a smile to Teague.

Teague gasps in shock and shakes his curls, extending his hand to her with worry. "You are injured in the head, Prims."

She nods with a stern face. "I love Preston. I am so sorry, Teague."

"This is over, Teague. You lost. I lost. We all lost here." Preston nods with a stern face and stands a few feet behind Primus without forcing another war between the demon and the angel.

Scooter nods with a stern face. "Primus is correct. Our angel leader Caiden is dead. You are our leader, so lead us, Teague."

Teague turns and stares at Scooter, looking down at the rock surface, then up at the skyline and finally returning back to see Primus. "I only wanted..."

"We want the same thing, Teague. We all want eternal happiness." Primus smiles.

"We do also. We want happiness without war and only peace." Bandy cuddles into Veck and nods to Primus. Veck turns and nods with a smile to Scooter. Scooter nods to Veck and then Teague. Teague turns and nods to Jazmine.

Jazmine continues to stand and sneers at Primus.

"Peace, Teague!" Preston extends his hand around Primus towards Teague with a nod.

Teague continues to stand and sneers at the extended hand from Preston.

Scooter reaches out and shoves Teague towards the pre-offered handshake and the final honor of peace between the fallen and faithful angels as each supernatural creatures is trapped and must survive together here on Planet Earth. "Peace, Preston!"

In the demon line, Barbie cuddles with her demon guy Blaze and nods with a smile to Teague. "And no more Curfew!"

Teague exhales with a head nod. "And no more Curfew either for the pod of nasty demons." He slowly moves ahead towards Primus and stares at the open palm on Preston. Preston gently shuffles Primus ahead and moves towards Teague, holding out his extended hand.

"Die!" Jazmine yells out loud and pulls out a small dagger from her battle vest, leaping forward at Primus with the deadly weapon.

Preston quickly lifts up his forearm and protects Primus, feeling the sharp blade, cutting deeply into his bicep.

Teague gasps in shock and whips out his sword, stabbing the tip through the back spine on Jazmine, slicing through her heart organ and exposes the bloody tip in front of her chest.

Jazmine halts in place and speaks two soft words, dropping her dagger down on the rock surface. "I was..."

"... wrong..." Teague sneers with fury and then jerks out his sword while watching a dead Jazmine tumble down on top of the rock surface.

Preston bows down at waistline and cuddles his wounded forearm, cursing out loud in pain.

Radium steps over with a sneer and cuddles Primus while watching the line of deceptive angels with caution.

Primus stands in place and watches Teague.

Teague wipes the bloody blade with his hand and extends the same bloody hand to Preston, laughing out loud. "Peace, Preston!"

A tall demon swiftly dives down from the sunny skyline and reaches out, grabbing the collar bone on Primus, encircling both of them through the air waves without hitting the rock surface in the village. The flying demon stands upright in the air and jerks Primus into her set of big breasts, using her demon strength, locking Primus in place. The demon female flies upwards towards heaven.

On top of the rock surface behind Preston, his demon warrior Radium bends his kneecaps and leaps up from the rock surface, flying after Primus.

"Colee!" Preston looks up and yells with angry, leaping up from the rock surface, flying after Colee and Primus.

On top of the rock surface, angel Teague jumps up from the surface and flies through the air waves after Preston, holding his sword.

In the skyline, above the pink desert soil, demon Radium reaches Colee first and then hovers in the air waves, tugging the forearm on Colee, stopping the female demon. Colee tries to fight with one fist and hits the nose bridge on Primus.

Radium sneers down at dizzy Primus, "I get to kill the little angel first, Colee."

"No, you don't. I get to do it." Colee continues to hit on tiny injured Primus and yell with fury at greedy Radium.

Primus continues to bite, kick, and punch using both of her hands and feet at Colee, who is a strong, stubborn, and mean she-devil.

Radium and Colee dance and twirl in the air waves. He reaches over and yanks Primus from Colee, cuddling Primus in his chest.

Colee is exposed to the element of sky and wind, extending an arm, trying to touch Primus, laughing out loud.

Preston flies through the air and brutally tears his sword straight through demon female Colee, slicing her body in half coming up from her tail bone into her skull plate as each one of her bloody parts of bones, skin, organs, and wings, limbs all separate and then prettily fall down in a steady stream of red tinted blood proteins and torn tissues towards the flat pink soil of the valley desert.

Preston looks up and sneers at Radium, who cuddles Primus. "Do not ..."

Radium grins with hateful fury at Preston. "Sorry! I did." He releases Primus as her body splits into two body parts. Her captivated skull separates from her neck muscles tumbling down, twirling over and over away from her headless body. Her skull smashes down first on top of the soil and creates a small plume of pink dust.

Within the skyline, Preston gasps in fear and follows each body part on a dead Primus, hitting the dry dirt, yelling in painful angry. "No! No! No!"

Teague flies through the sky with growls of rage and rams his sword tip into Radium's exposed chest, and then halts in front of the demon, jerking back his sword, displaying a pumping bloody organ from Radium in the open sky. A dead Radium slowly falls down and then splatters into numerous body parts on top of the dry dirt.

Teague slowly spins around and growls at Preston, jabbing a finger at the demon. "You are a son of bitch, god damn demon."

Preston whips out his sword and jabs the tip at Teague, yelling in fury. "You are a sorry motherfucking asshole angel."

"Die, Preston!" Teague snarls and whips his sword in the air with fury.

Preston swishes his saber side to side and laughs out loud with revenge. "You first, Teague!"

Then, their individual shiny swords clash violently like loud thunder within the pale blue sky, on a bright sunny day.

The end
