crossrail link 'to get go-ahead' the â£10bn crossrail transport plan , backed by business groups , is to get the go-ahead this month , according to the mail on sunday . it says the uk treasury has allocated â£7.5bn ( $ 13.99bn ) for the project and that talks with business groups on raising the rest will begin shortly . the much delayed crossrail link bill would provide for a fast cross-london rail link . the paper says it will go before the house of commons on 23 february . a second reading could follow on 16 or 17 march . `` we 've always said we are going to introduce a hybrid bill for crossrail in the spring and this remains the case , '' the department for transport said on sunday . jeremy de souza , a spokesman for crossrail , said on sunday he could not confirm whether the treasury was planning to invest â£7.5bn or when the bill would go before parliament . however , he said some impetus may have been provided by the proximity of an election . the new line would go out as far as maidenhead , berkshire , to the west of london , and link heathrow to canary wharf via the city . heathrow to the city would take 40 minutes , dramatically cutting journey times for business travellers , and reducing overcrowding on the tube . the line has the support of the mayor of london , ken livingstone , business groups and the government , but there have been three years of arguments over how it should be funded . the mail on sunday 's financial mail said the â£7.5bn of treasury money was earmarked for spending in â£2.5bn instalments in 2010 , 2011 and 2012 .
