finnan says irish can win group steve finnan believes the republic of ireland can qualify directly for the world cup finals . after saturday 's superb display in the draw in paris , ireland face minnows the faroe islands in dublin on wednesday . the versatile finnan , who starred against the french , is confident the group is ireland 's for the taking . `` there is a chance for us now to go on , win our home games and why not win the group , even though it 's a tough one , '' said the liverpool player . switzerland , ireland , france and israel are all now tied on five points from three matches - although the republic look to have a slight edge after claiming away draws in basel and paris . `` in basel we did not play great football , but when you to go to these places the other teams are going to have the majority of the game . `` in paris , we looked good throughout the team and a point was the least we deserved because we had a number of chances . `` looking back , we had an opportunity to get the three points , but we are happy with a point and that will give us confidence going into wednesday 's game . `` on paper , we have got the toughest matches out of the way and we have set standards for ourselves . `` automatic qualification is there . it would certainly be good to avoid a play-off , but on the back of a couple of good results i do n't see why we ca n't win the group . '' manager brian kerr was keen to mention the contribution of stephen carr and finnan on ireland 's right flank at the stade de france . finnan 's normal position is right-back but he looked assured in a more advanced position against the french . `` as i play on the right for my club and being a natural right-back , it was something he ( kerr ) looked at because france play strongly down the left-hand side . `` so i was happy to play and stephen carr and i enjoyed the game , particularly as the defence and midfield held together well and nullified their attacks .
