ruddock backs yapp 's credentials wales coach mike ruddock says john yapp has what it takes as an international . the 21-year-old blues prop is the only uncapped player in wales ' six nations squad , gaining a chance in the absence of ospreys loose-head duncan jones . `` john is a young man with a big future . he has been playing with the blues for two years and has racked up mileage on his playing clock , '' said ruddock . `` he has international size , is a big , physical lad and a good ball-carrier with a high tackle-count . '' ruddock 's assessment was backed up by yapp 's coach at the blues , former wales and lions prop dai young . `` john 's been on an upward curve all season and is going from strength to strength , '' young told bbc sport wales . `` his ball carrying gives us good go-forward , he impresses in defence and his work-rate is excellent . `` he 's working hard on his scrummaging technique , which he is keen to improve to become a destroyer on the loose-head . `` to be fair to him he 's not quite there with the scrummaging yet , but nobody can fault his effort , commitment and attitude . `` john 's a very strong man and is eager for the challenge , if he 's pitched in he wo n't let anyone down . `` he 's developing quickly , but i hope he is n't pushed too quickly in a way that would hurt his development . '' ruddock hopes that the selection of yapp and dragons lock ian gough - out of the international reckoning since falling out with former coach steve hansen - will send a message to other players in wales . `` john and ian have been rewarded for impressing during the heineken cup competition , '' said ruddock . `` both of them have played well , and we want to send a message out that consistently playing well gets you in the squad . `` we believe this is an exciting squad representing traditional values of welsh rugby , and based on the performances in the november internationals . `` we have strength and experience up front , and well-recognised talent , pace and skill behind . `` the management team just want to get hold of the players and get out on the training pitch at the moment . `` they are all due in on sunday , and that 's when the hard work starts .
