blinx sequel purrs nicely the original blinx was intended to convert many platform game lovers to microsoft 's then new xbox console . its sharp graphics and novel gameplay , with the main character able to pause , slow , rewind and fast-forward time , were meant to lure many fans to the new machine . but poor design meant the game became a very frustrating affair with players often stranded half-way through a level without the required tools to finish . thankfully , the sequel has fixed many of the original faults . this time around you do not play as blinx but instead you are given the chance to create two unique cat characters and two pig characters . the character generator is very detailed and a few minutes of tweaking and adjusting will create a unique personality to unleash on the game . as the game progresses you swap between the two rival factions , pig and feline , assuming the role of your created characters . the thrust of the game sees the two factions competing to recover pieces of a missing time crystal . as in the original , your feline persona can control time , but this time the pigs get to control space . there are a number of puzzles which require control over time to solve while the pigs can create things such as warps , space bubbles and void traps in order to progress . the control over space and time is achieved through a number of vcr-style icons and is quite intuitive . annoyingly , the puzzles are a little too obviously flagged up and most gamers will find it more of a chore than a challenge to solve them . the game has also tried to emulate franchises such as jak and daxter and ratchet and clank on ps2 and so there are a number of combat elements . these are a little predictable and tend to drag the general polish of the game down to a more dulled affair . but the game 's excellent graphics , easily the best-looking platform game around , sound and dollops of humour make it an attractive game for younger platform fans . blinx 2 is out on xbox now .
