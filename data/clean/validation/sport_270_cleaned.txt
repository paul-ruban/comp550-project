strachan turns down pompey former southampton manager gordon strachan has rejected the chance to become portsmouth 's new boss . the scot was pompey chairman milan mandaric 's first choice to replace harry redknapp , who left fratton park for rivals saints earlier in december . `` i think it 's a fantastic job for anybody apart from somebody who has just been the southampton manager , '' strachan told the bbc . club director terry brady held initial talks with strachan on saturday . the former scotland international added that joining southampton 's local rivals would not be a wise move . `` it 's got everything going for it but i 've got too many memories of the other side and i do n't want to sour those memories , '' he said . `` everything 's right - it 's 10 minutes away , there are good players there , a good set-up , a good atmosphere at the ground . `` there 's lots to do but it 's not right for somebody who has just been the southampton manager . '' since redknapp 's departure , executive director velimir zajec and coach joe jordan have overseen first-team affairs . the duo had gone five matches unbeaten until sunday 's 1-0 defeat at home to champions arsenal , but the club are still in a respectable 12th place in the premiership table . strachan left st mary 's in february , after earlier announcing his intention to take a break from the game at the end of the 2003-04 season . his previous managerial experience came at coventry , whom he led for five years from 1996 to 2001 .
