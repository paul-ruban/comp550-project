johnson uncertain about euro bid jade johnson is undecided about whether to contest next month 's european indoor championships in madrid despite winning the aaas long jump title on saturday . the 24-year-old delivered a personal best of 6.50m to win the european trials but had to wait until her final jump after four failures . `` i do n't want to go if i am not going to get a medal , '' said johnson . `` i will have to see how i am jumping in the next competition and i 'll have to have a conversation with my coach . '' johnson , who finished seventh in last year 's olympic games , has not competed indoors since 2000 . and the commonwealth and european silver medallist believes her lack of experience in the early part of the season has knocked her confidence . `` it 's the stress , '' said johnson . `` i am not used to feeling this , this early . i am just used to training . `` but if i 'm doing this kind of thing , then i will have to see how it goes . '' johnson next competes in the high-class birmingham grand prix on 18 february .
