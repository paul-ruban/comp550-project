wales get williams fitness boost wales are hopeful that openside flanker martyn williams could be fit for saturday 's rbs 6 nations championship opener against england in cardiff . williams was expected to miss the match with a disc problem in his neck , but has been making a speedy recovery . `` he will have tests in the next 48 hours and we are pretty optimistic he is getting there , '' wales ' team physiotherapist mark davies said . `` it has been frustrating but he is on the mend , he has made good progress . '' last week williams , along with fellow flanker colin charvis - who is unlikely to play for at least a month while he recovers from a foot injury - was all but ruled out of the millennium stadium clash . with williams initially thought to be struggling , the signs pointed towards wales coach mike ruddock handing a first cap to former wales under-21 skipper richie pugh . cardiff blues flanker williams , 29 , offers considerable experience and if he is declared fit then ruddock might be tempted to include him in the back row . charvis will be reviewed by the wales medical staff next monday , but davies admitted that there was only an `` outside chance '' of him being fit to face france in wales ' third championship game on 26 february . wales ' other injury concern is pugh 's fellow neath-swansea ospreys player sonny parker , as the centre has a trapped nerve in his neck . `` sonny 's injury is still an issue , '' davies said . `` it is still painful and irritable . we will run the rule of thumb over him in the next couple of days . '' ruddock will name his starting line-up for the england game at 1830 gmt on tuesday evening , as wales target their first victory in cardiff over the world champions since 1993 .
