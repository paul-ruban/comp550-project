england coach faces rap after row england coach andy robinson is facing disciplinary action after criticising referee jonathan kaplan in his side 's six nations defeat to ireland . the rugby football union ( rfu ) will investigate robinson after deciding not to lodge a complaint against kaplan . robinson may even have to apologise for his comments in order to avoid sanction from the international rugby board . robinson had said he was `` livid '' about kaplan 's decisions on saturday to disallow two england `` tries . '' the england coach went on to claim that `` only one side was refereed '' . after reviewing tapes of the match , the rfu decided not to formally complain to the irb over the standard of kaplan 's refereeing . instead the rfu said in a statement they would , `` set out any concerns the england team management may have in a confidential manner '' . an irb spokesman said on the matter : `` we take all breaches of the code very seriously . `` should the rfu resolve the issue to our satisfaction , as happened last month when the scotland coach matt williams apologised for remarks made , it would be the end of the matter . '' kaplan has vigorously defended his performance in england 's 19-13 defeat at landsdowne road and admitted he was `` very disappointed '' with robinson 's remarks . and the south african has been appointed to take charge of scotland 's match against wales on 13 march . the rfu recently fined northampton coach budge pountney â£2,000 and imposed a six-week ban for his criticism of referee steve lander after a premiership match .
