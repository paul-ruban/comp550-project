greene sets sights on world title maurice greene aims to wipe out the pain of losing his olympic 100m title in athens by winning a fourth world championship crown this summer . he had to settle for bronze in greece behind fellow american justin gatlin and francis obikwelu of portugal . `` it really hurts to look at that medal . it was my mistake . i lost because of the things i did , '' said greene , who races in birmingham on friday . `` it 's never going to happen again . my goal - i 'm going to win the worlds . '' greene crossed the line just 0.02 seconds behind gatlin , who won in 9.87 seconds in one of the closest and fastest sprints of all time . but greene believes he lost the race and his title in the semi-finals . `` in my semi-final race , i should have won the race but i was conserving energy . `` that 's when francis obikwelu came up and i took third because i did n't know he was there . `` i believe that 's what put me in lane seven in the final and , while i was in lane seven , i could n't feel anything in the race . `` i just felt like i was running all alone . `` i believe if i was in the middle of the race i would have been able to react to people that came ahead of me . '' greene was also denied olympic gold in the 4x100m men 's relay when he could not catch britain 's mark lewis-francis on the final leg . the kansas star is set to go head-to-head with lewis-francis again at friday 's norwich union grand prix . the pair contest the 60m , the distance over which greene currently holds the world record of 6.39 seconds . he then has another indoor meeting in france before resuming training for the outdoor season and the task of recapturing his world title in helsinki in august . greene believes gatlin will again prove the biggest threat to his ambitions in finland . but he also admits he faces more than one rival for the world crown . `` there 's always someone else coming . i think when i was coming up i would say there was me and ato ( boldon ) in the young crowd , '' greene said . `` now you 've got about five or six young guys coming up at the same time .
