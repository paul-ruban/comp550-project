nintendo adds media playing to ds nintendo is releasing an adapter for its ds handheld console so it can play music and video . the add-on for the ds means people can download tv programmes , film clips or mp3 files to the adaptor and then play them back while on the move . the release of the media add-on is an attempt by the japanese games giant to protect its dominance of the handheld gaming market . nintendo said the media adapter will be available from february in japan . the nintendo ds is the successor to the hugely successful gameboy handheld game console and went on sale in japan on 2 december . the ds has two screens , one of which is touch sensitive , and also has on-board a short-range wireless link that lets people play against each other . the launch of the media adapter , and the attempt to broaden the appeal of the device , is widely seen as a response to the unveiling of the sony psp which was built as a multi-purpose media player and game gadget from the start . sony is thought to be preparing pre-packaged movies and music for the psp . the add-on will also work with the gameboy advance sp . nintendo dominates the handheld gaming console world thanks to successive versions of the gameboy . more than 28 million gameboy advance handhelds have been sold around the world . the dual-screen ds is also thought to be selling well with more than 2.5 million expected to be sold by the end of 2004 . nintendo said it had no plans to sell the media adapter outside japan . when it goes on sale the adapter is expected to cost about 5000 yen ( â£25 ) , roughly the difference in price between the ds and the higher-priced sony psp .
