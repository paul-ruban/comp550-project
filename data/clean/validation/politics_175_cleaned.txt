chancellor rallies labour voters gordon brown has issued a rallying cry , telling supporters the `` stakes are too high '' to stay at home or protest vote in the forthcoming general election . the chancellor said the vote - expected to fall on 5 may - will give a `` clear and fundamental '' choice between labour investment and conservative cuts . speaking at labour 's spring conference in gateshead , mr brown claimed the nhs was not safe in conservative hands . he said tory plans to cut â£35bn tax would `` cut deep into public service '' . to a packed audience at gateshead 's sage centre , the chancellor said the cuts proposed by shadow chancellor oliver letwin were the equivalent of sacking every teacher , gp and nurse in the country , he told activists . laying into the conservative 's record in government he said : `` i give you this promise - with labour , britain will never return to the mistakes of erm and 10 % inflation , 15 % interest rates , â£3bn in lost reserves , 250,000 repossessed , one million in negative equity and three million unemployed . `` never again tory boom and bust . `` this will be the central dividing line at the election , between a conservative party taking britain back and planning deep cuts of â£35bn in our services , and a labour government taking britain forward , which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals , schools and public services and , i am proud to say , spend by 2008 â£60bn more . '' turning to the economy , the chancellor pledged to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power . he said after seven years labour had transformed from a party not trusted with the economy to `` the only party trusted with the economy '' . it was now a `` party not just of employees , but of employers and managers '' , he said . in the speech - which prompted a standing ovation from an audience clearly `` warm '' to mr brown - he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years . he also highlighted plans for 100 % debt relief for the world 's poorest countries , a national minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds and the creation of a network of children 's centres and flexibility in maternity leave . the prime minister is to take part later on saturday in an interactive question and answer session , fielding queries sent in by e-mail , text message and telephone as part of labour 's attempt to engage the public in their campaign .
