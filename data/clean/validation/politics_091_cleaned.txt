vouchers 'to cut winter deaths' pensioners are being promised energy savings by the liberal democrats , as snow and cold temperatures continue . the party says the plans could save the average pensioner â£100 every year and cut winter deaths . the government gives â£200 for winter fuel to households with people over 60 , or â£300 where people are over 80 . the tories promise to keep the payments . the lib dems would allow people to swap these winter fuel payments for discounts on home insulation . shadow local government secretary ed davey said : `` the current scheme has helped some older people , but this new liberal democrat approach will go much further to end the scandal of tens of thousands of old people dying from the winter cold every year . '' the vouchers are designed to let pensioners choose from a list of approved energy supplies who would compete for business by offering discounts on home insulation schemes . the plan would boost energy conservation , says the party - and insulation could save â£100 every year for pensioner households , so using the money more `` intelligently '' than at present .
