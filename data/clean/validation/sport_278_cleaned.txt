robben and cole earn chelsea win cheslea salvaged a win against a battling portsmouth side just as it looked like the premiership leaders would have to settle for a point . arjen robben curled in a late deflected left-footed shot from the right side of pompey 's box to break the home side 's brave resistance . chelsea had been continually frustrated but joe cole added a second with a 20-yard shot in injury-time . nigel quashie had pompey 's best chance when his effort was tipped over . the fratton park crowd were in good voice as usual and , even though portsmouth more than held their own , chelsea still managed to carve out two early chances . striker didier drogba snapped in an angled shot to force home keeper shaka hislop into a smart save while an unmarked frank lampard had a strike blocked by arjan de zeeuw . but pompey chased , harried and unsettled a chelsea side as the south-coast side started to gain the upper hand and almost took the lead through quashie . the midfielder struck a swerving long range shot which keeper petr cech tipped over at full stretch . pompey stretched arsenal to the limit recently and were providing a similarly tough obstacle to overcome for a chelsea team struggling to exert any pressure . velimir zajec 's players stood firm as the visitors came out in lively fashion after the break but , just as they took a stranglehold of the match , the visitors launched a counter-attack . drogba spun to get a sight of goal and struck a fierce shot which rocked keeper hislop back as he blocked before arjan de zeeuw cleared the danger . the home side were also left breathing a sigh of relief when a glen johnson header fell to gudjohnsen who had his back to goal in a crowded pompey goalmouth . the icelandic forward tried to acrobatically direct the ball into goal but put his effort over . but , just like against arsenal , portsmouth let in a late goal when robben 's shot took a deflection off matthew taylor on its way past a wrong-footed hislop . and cole put a bit of gloss on a hard-fought win when he put a low shot into the bottom of the pompey net . hislop , griffin , primus , de zeeuw , taylor , stone ( cisse 76 ) , quashie ( berkovic 83 ) , faye , o'neil , kamara ( fuller 65 ) , yakubu . subs not used : berger , ashdown . kamara . cech , paulo ferreira , gallas , terry , johnson , duff , makelele , smertin ( cole 73 ) , lampard , robben ( geremi 81 ) , drogba ( gudjohnsen 58 ) . subs not used : cudicini , bridge . paulo ferreira , robben , lampard . robben 79 , cole 90 . 20,210 a wiley ( staffordshire ) .
