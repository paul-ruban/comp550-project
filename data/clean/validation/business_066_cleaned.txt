german business confidence slides german business confidence fell in february knocking hopes of a speedy recovery in europe 's largest economy . munich-based research institute ifo said that its confidence index fell to 95.5 in february from 97.5 in january , its first decline in three months . the study found that the outlook in both the manufacturing and retail sectors had worsened . observers had been hoping that a more confident business sector would signal that economic activity was picking up . `` we 're surprised that the ifo index has taken such a knock , '' said dz bank economist bernd weidensteiner . `` the main reason is probably that the domestic economy is still weak , particularly in the retail trade . '' economy and labour minister wolfgang clement called the dip in february 's ifo confidence figure `` a very mild decline '' . he said that despite the retreat , the index remained at a relatively high level and that he expected `` a modest economic upswing '' to continue . germany 's economy grew 1.6 % last year after shrinking in 2003 . however , the economy contracted by 0.2 % during the last three months of 2004 , mainly due to the reluctance of consumers to spend . latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and ifo president hans-werner sinn said any improvement in german domestic demand was sluggish . exports had kept things going during the first half of 2004 , but demand for exports was then hit as the value of the euro hit record levels making german products less competitive overseas . on top of that , the unemployment rate has been stuck at close to 10 % and manufacturing firms , including daimlerchrysler , siemens and volkswagen , have been negotiating with unions over cost cutting measures . analysts said that the ifo figures and germany 's continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the european central bank . eurozone interest rates are at 2 % , but comments from senior officials have recently focused on the threat of inflation , prompting fears that interest rates may rise .
