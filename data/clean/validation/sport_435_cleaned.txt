mirza shocks kuznetsova sania mirza continued her remarkable rise with victory over us open champion svetlana kuznetsova at the dubai championships on tuesday . the 18-year-old indian , who is already a huge star in her home country , won 6-4 6-2 in front of a delirious crowd . it was mirza 's sixth straight victory following her first wta tournament win in hyderabad last month . earlier , daniela hantuchova built on her improving form with a 7-6 6-2 win over sixth seed alicia molik . mirza needed attention to an ankle injury after the second game against kuznetsova . she quickly slipped 4-0 down but staged a dramatic comeback that thrilled the large indian contingent in the crowd . `` i really did n't expect that after my ankle turn , '' said mirza . `` i played a great match and i think ( the crowd ) did it again . i knew that i had to play an all-round game and that 's what happened . `` i did everything well but i was n't missing the ball - i do n't know how that happened . '' mirza plays silvia farina elia or jelena jankovic next . hantuchova has risen from 31 in the world at the turn of the year to number 22 , having reached the quarter-finals and semi-finals at her last two events . `` it was such a tough first-round match and i am glad to come through , '' said hantuchova . `` she was serving so well . i just decided to hang in there and keep fighting . '' the slovakian will meet elena likhovtseva in the second round after the russian struggled past tunisian wild card selima sfar 2-6 6-2 7-6 . likhovtseva needed nine match points before seeing off sfar , who got a point penalty for swearing in the third set . seventh seed nathalie dechy and elena bovina were among other first-round winners on tuesday .
