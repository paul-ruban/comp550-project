kennedy questions trust of blair lib dem leader charles kennedy has said voters now have a `` fundamental lack of trust '' of tony blair as prime minister . he said backing his party was not a wasted vote , adding that with the lib dems `` what you see is what you get '' . he made his comments at the start of a day of appearances on channel five in a session on the wright stuff programme . questions from callers , a studio audience and the show 's presenter covered lib dem tax plans , anti-terror laws and immigration . mr kennedy said during his nearly 22 years in parliament he had seen prime ministers and party leaders come and go and knew the pitfalls of british politics . `` 1983 was when i was first elected as an mp - so tony blair , michael howard and myself were all class of '83 - and over that nearly quarter of a century the world has changed out of recognition , '' he said . `` we do n't actually hear the argument any longer : 'lib dems , good people , reasonable ideas but only if we thought they could win around here - it 's a wasted vote ' . `` you do n't hear that because the evidence of people 's senses demonstrates that it is n't a wasted vote . '' but he said mr blair had lost the trust of the british people . `` there is a fundamental lack of trust in tony blair as prime minister and in his government , '' he said . `` what we 've got to do as a party - what i 've got to do as a leader of this party - is to convey to people that what you see is what you get . '' mr kennedy also used his tv appearance to defend his party 's plans to increase income tax to 50 % for those earning more than â£100,000 , saying it would apply to just 1 % of the population . he said the extra revenue would allow his party to get rid of tuition and top-up fees , introduce free personal care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax . mr blair has already spent a day with five and michael howard is booked for a similar session .
