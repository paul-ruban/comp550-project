buyers snap up jet airways ' shares investors have snapped up shares in jet airways , india 's biggest airline , following the launch of its much anticipated initial public offer ( ipo ) . the ipo for 17.3 million shares was fully sold within 10 minutes of opening , on friday . analysts expect jet to raise at least 16.4bn rupees ( $ 375m ; â£198m ) from the offering . interest in jet 's ipo has been fuelled by hopes for robust growth in india 's air travel market . the share offer , representing about 20 % of jet 's equity , was oversubscribed , news agency reuters reported . jet , which was founded by london-based travel agent naresh goyal , plans to use the cash to buy new planes and cut its debt . the company has grown rapidly since it launched operations in 1993 , overtaking state-owned flag carrier indian airlines . however , it faces stiff competition from rivals and low-cost carriers . jet 's ipo is the first in a series of expected share offers from indian companies this year , as they move to raise funds to help them do business in a rapidly-growing economy .
