february poll claim 'speculation' reports that tony blair is planning a snap general election for february 2005 have been described as `` idle speculation '' by downing street . a spokesman said he had `` no idea '' where the reports in the sunday times and sunday telegraph had come from . the papers suggest ministers believe the government could benefit from a `` baghdad bounce '' following successful iraq elections in january . a british general election was last held in february in 1974 . in that election , edward heath lost and failed to build a coalition with the liberals . harold wilson took over and increased his majority later in the year in a second election the latest speculation suggests the prime minister favours a february poll in order to exploit his current opinion poll lead over conservative leader michael howard . but that strategy could prompt criticism he was seeking to `` cut and run '' after less then four years of a parliamentary term . the papers report that alan milburn , labour 's head of elections strategy , has played a key role in the plan for a february election , which would include a new year advertising blitz . new labour 's campaign , both newspapers said , would be centred around the slogan `` britain is working '' . a labour party spokesman said the election date was ultimately a matter for mr blair , but he was unaware of anything to suggest it would be in february . most commentators have been expecting an election on 5 may . the last election was in june 2001 .
