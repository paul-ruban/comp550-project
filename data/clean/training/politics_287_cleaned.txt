boothroyd calls for lords speaker betty boothroyd has said the house of lords needs its own speaker and that peers should lead the way on reforming the upper chamber . baroness boothroyd , who was the first woman to be commons speaker , said she believed tony blair initiated reforms without a clear outcome in mind . `` now we have to take care of it ourselves and make the best of it , '' she told the bbc 's breakfast with frost . in 1999 labour removed all but 92 of the lords ' 750 hereditary peers . that was billed as the first stage of reform of the institution . the lord chancellor hinted further reforms could be unveiled in the next labour manifesto . `` i think we need to look very carefully at the relationship between the lords and the commons , '' lord falconer told bbc1 's breakfast with frost . `` how it interacts with the commons is a very , very important issue . `` we need to address the issue in the manifesto , but you will have to wait for when the manifesto comes . '' the lord chancellor currently has the role of house of lords speaker . he is also head of the judiciary and a member of the cabinet as constitutional affairs secretary . lady boothroyd said she believed it was unacceptable for the lord chancellor to have the role of speaker . `` i would really like to see a speaker of the house of lords , '' she said . `` i do n't go for the idea of somebody - a lord chancellor - who is head of the judiciary , a senior cabinet minister and speaker of the lords . `` i want somebody there who is going to look after that house and do a job there .
