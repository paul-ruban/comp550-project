'' if they do not respond or their explanations are rejected , they will be provisionally banned from competition . they will then face a hearing in front of the greek federation , which will ultimately determine their fate . their former coach christos tzekos has also been charged with distributing banned substances . under iaaf rules , the athletes could receive a maximum one-year suspension . kenteris and thanou already face a criminal trial after being charged with avoiding a drug test on the eve of the athens olympics and then faking a motorcyle crash . no date for the trial has yet been set and again tzekos is also facing charges . the iaaf issued an official warning to the trio last year after they were discovered training in qatar rather than in crete , where they had said they would be . all athletes must inform their national federations where they are at all times , so they can be available for out-of-competition drugs tests . but kenteris and thanou then went on to skip tests in tel aviv and chicago , when they decided to fly back to greece early . then just before the olympics , the pair dramatically missed another test in athens and withdrew from the games .
