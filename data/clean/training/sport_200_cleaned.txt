ferguson urges henry punishment sir alex ferguson has called on the football association to punish arsenal 's thierry henry for an incident involving gabriel heinze . ferguson believes henry deliberately caught heinze on the head with his knee during united 's controversial win . the united boss said it was worse than ruud van nistelrooy 's foul on ashley cole for which he got a three-game ban . `` we shall present it to the fa and see what they do . the tackle on heinze was terrible , '' he said . clubs are permitted to ask the fa to examine specific incidents but information is expected to be provided within 48 hours of the game . the clash occurred moments before half-time when a freddie ljungberg challenge left heinze on the ground on the left touchline . henry , following the ball , attempted to hurdle the argentine but his knee collided with the back of heinze 's head . the striker protested his innocence - and referee mike riley deemed the collision accidental . ferguson was also upset by arsenal 's overall discipline during the heated encounter between the two arch-rivals and praised his own side 's behaviour . `` edu produced a terrible tackle on scholes that was a potential leg-breaker , '' he said . `` there were 24 fouls in the game by arsenal , seven on heinze , five on ronaldo , six by vieira - and it was only his sixth foul that got him booked . phil neville got booked for his first challenge . `` i am proud of my players for the way they handled that pressure . `` we have always been good at being gracious in defeat . what happened on sunday overshadowed our achievement , but then they do it all the time , do n't they ?
