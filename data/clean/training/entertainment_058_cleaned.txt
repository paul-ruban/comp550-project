berlin hails european cinema organisers say this year 's berlin film festival , which opens on thursday with period epic man to man , will celebrate a revitalised european cinema . of the 21 films in competition for the golden and silver bear awards , more than half are from europe with france particularly well represented . festival director dieter kosslick says this strong showing signals `` a new consciousness for european films '' . `` they 're on an incredible winning streak , '' he told the reuters agency . `` this is n't to say there are n't any good american films , '' he continued . `` it 's just that there are more good european films . '' however , mr kosslick refused to accept that widespread opposition to the iraq war had turned audiences against hollywood imports . `` there is no anti-american mood , '' he said . some 350 films will be screened at this year 's festival , with a further 300 shown at the european film market that runs alongside it . more than a dozen celebrities are scheduled to attend , among them will smith , kevin spacey and keanu reeves . but mr kosslick says more would be coming had the academy awards not been brought forward to 27 february . `` i 'm not worried that we wo n't be able to fill the red carpet with stars , '' he said , though he admitted the festival may be moved to january next year to avoid a similar clash . the 10-day berlinale runs until 20 february .
