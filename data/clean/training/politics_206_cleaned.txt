blair 's hope for blunkett return the events leading to david blunkett 's resignation must not `` swept under the carpet '' , the tories have warned . on wednesday tony blair said he hoped the former home secretary would serve again in government in the future . mr blunkett quit in december after a probe linked him to the visa application of his ex-lover 's nanny . mr blair said he left `` without a stain on his character '' but tory dominic grieve branded the way mr blunkett 's office operated as `` scandalous '' . mr blair told bbc radio 4 's today programme : `` i know david very well and i believe him to be a man of real integrity and real ability and i was very sad for him as to what happened . '' he said mr blunkett still had an immense amount to offer the country but he was not making any `` guarantees or definitive statements '' about future jobs . but shadow attorney general mr grieve said : `` while i do n't rule out the possibility that mr blunkett may return as a minister , i do n't think it 's something that can simply be brushed under the carpet . '' senior labour backbencher martin o'neill , who chairs the commons trade committee , said he believed the prime minister would want one of his `` praetorian guard '' - a reference to the elite body guard of roman emperors - back alongside him . but colleague ian gibson , who chairs the science and technology committee , said there was a `` question mark '' as to whether mr blunkett could serve at cabinet level again .
