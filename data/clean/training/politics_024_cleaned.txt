brown visits slum on africa trip chancellor gordon brown has visited kenya 's biggest shantytown as he opened a week-long visit to africa . mr brown 's trip is designed to highlight how the uk wants to make africa 's problems a priority of its chairmanship of the g8 this year . he will see an hiv/aids orphanage in tanzania and a women 's credit union in mozambique before chairing a meeting of the commission for africa in cape town . at slums in narobi on wednesday , he said education needs had to be tackled . speaking outside the olympic primary school , mr brown said : `` it is simply not acceptable in the modern age for the rest of the world to stand by and have hundreds of millions of children not getting the chance at education . '' he pointed to international plans to invest $ 10bn for education in africa over the next decade . the school is on the edge of kibera , where 800,000 live often in huts made of mud , scrap metal and cardboard . mr brown 's aides say he wants to find out more about the kenyan government 's education policies , which included introducing free primary education in early 2003 . the chancellor has already unveiled proposals for a g8 aid package which he has likened to the marshall plan used by the united states to rebuild europe after world war two . the trip follows claims of infighting between mr brown and tony blair detailed in a new book . conservative leader michael howard is expected to seize on those reports at prime minister 's questions at 1200 gmt on wednesday .
