leaders meet over turkish eu bid tony blair has met italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and german chancellor gerhard schroeder to talk about turkey entering the eu . the downing street talks covered a range of other topics ahead of an eu summit in brussels later in the week . mr blair is an enthusiastic proponent of talks to bring turkey within the recently-expanded eu . italy and germany also favour an early start to talks , but there is scepticism in france and elsewhere . some are worried that turkey 's large and rapidly growing population and low average income might make integration into the eu difficult . some are concerned that a change of government could lead to turkey reneging on key human rights reforms it has recently enacted . and many in france would prefer turkey to admit that world war i-era killing of armenians constituted genocide . there are also issues in france and the netherlands over the possible problems of integrating the first major muslim nation into the eu . but mr blair and the labour government have been the staunchest backers of turkish accession , provided it sticks with human rights and economic reform . mr blair 's official spokesman said : `` the prime minister has regular meetings with both of them and particularly in advance of european councils . `` the key issue at this week 's council will be that of turkey , but they will also discuss a range of other matters .
