parker misses england clash tom shanklin will start in the centre for wales against england in cardiff on saturday after sonny parker failed to recover from a trapped neck nerve . shanklin was first-choice wing in the autumn tests , but prefers centre and will face england debutant mathew tait . dragons three-quarter hal luscombe takes shanklin 's wing berth . up front , mefin davies plays at hooker , open-side martyn williams is fit to start and lock rob sidoli replaces veteran gareth llewellyn . davies wins the vote ahead of robin mcbryde , who sits on the bench having recently returned to action for the scarlets following a neck injury . sidoli is back for the first time since last season 's six nations , the blues second row back to form after a niggling groin problem . williams , sidoli 's team-mate at cardiff , is set to win his 50th cap , replacing the injured colin charvis after making a quicker-than-expected recovery from a neck disc problem . `` initially when i had the diagnosis it was a case of trying to get fit for the italy game next week , but fortunately my recovery has been a lot quicker than we all hoped , '' williams told bbc sport wales . `` i have n't started a game since 1 january and would have preferred to have a couple of games in the lead-up to this , but the good thing with the injury is that i have kept up my fitness levels . `` i feel quite fresh and i just ca n't wait to play again . '' williams says he expects a torrid time from an england loose-forward trio of lewis moody , joe worsley and andy hazell . `` they are three top-class players , especially worsley and moody . they have been there and done it , '' williams added . `` they were back-ups behind richard hill , neil back and lawrence dallaglio , but now they have come forward and proved what good players they are - there are no weaknesses there .
