eu software patent law delayed controversial new eu rules for the patenting of computer-based inventions have been put on hold due to a last minute intervention from poland . poland - a large and therefore crucial eu member - has requested more time to consider the issue , especially as it relates to the patenting of software . critics say the law would favour large companies over small , innovative ones . they say it could have massive ramifications for developments such as open source software . polish ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions changed so that it excludes the patenting of software . the planned law has ignited angry debate about whether the eu should allow the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods as currently happens in the us . so , for instance , us-based amazon.com holds a patent on 'one-click shopping ' . critics claim the law , which the eu says is needed to harmonise with the us , is little more than a law on ideas . `` patent rights , it is claimed , protect inventors but in this case it is exclusively the interests of the big companies that are protected , '' eva lichtenberg , a austrian green member of the european parliament said in a statement . `` smaller , innovative firms can not afford the patenting and legal costs that the directive would inflict on them , '' she added . the european parliament has already clashed with the european union on the issue and there have been accusations that the process to decide the issue has been undemocratic . the directive has been subject to several previous delays .
