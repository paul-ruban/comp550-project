hoffman hits out over modern film hollywood legend dustin hoffman has hit out at the quality of current films and theatre productions . the star of rain man and tootsie said the film culture was `` in the craphouse '' at a press conference on tuesday . the 67-year-old also said he stopped working a few years ago because he lost his `` spark '' for acting . hoffman is in the uk to publicise his new comedy , meet the fockers , which also stars robert de niro , barbra streisand and ben stiller . he said : `` you go to the cinema and you realise you 're watching the third act . there is no first or second act . `` there is this massive film-making where you spend this incredible amount of money and play right to the demographic . `` you can tell how much money the film is going to make by how it does on the first weekend . `` the whole culture is in the craphouse . it 's not just true in the movies , it 's also true in the theatre . `` broadway , and now london is the same , special effects are in great demand . it 's not a good time culturally . '' hoffman also said he stopped working a few years ago and moved into directing and writing . he said : `` i just lost that spark i always had . `` a couple of years ago i did n't like the parts i was getting . `` studios were n't interested in the kind of films that people of my generation wanted to see . `` i thought i would stop and just try writing and directing . i was n't aware of the depression that set in . '' recently , hoffmann has returned to film , with roles in i heart huckabees , finding neverland and now meet the fockers , which is the sequel to meet the parents . meet the fockers opens in the uk on friday .
