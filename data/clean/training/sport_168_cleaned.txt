'' adriano has scored 14 goals in 20 serie a appearances this season . and chelsea boss jose mourinho had claimed that he was in milan talking to adriano on the day he is alleged to have held a clandestine meeting with arsenal defender ashley cole . mourinho said he was `` just practising my portuguese with him because i do n't need strikers '' . rinaldi told bbc sport : `` i have to say that nobody from chelsea or any other london club has contacted me . `` if they want to , that 's fine . i can tell them what the situation is . `` if chelsea are interested then they must make an offer .
