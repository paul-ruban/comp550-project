mourinho defiant on chelsea form chelsea boss jose mourinho has insisted that sir alex ferguson and arsene wenger would swap places with him . mourinho 's side were knocked out of the fa cup by newcastle last sunday before seeing barcelona secure a 2-1 champions league first-leg lead in the nou camp . but he denied his club was suffering a dip in form which league rivals arsenal and manchester united could exploit . `` they can not speak to us about blips because they 're not in a better position than us , '' mourinho said . `` do they want to change positions with us ? we are top of the league by nine points and in the carling cup final . `` the only thing they can say they are in a better position than us in is the fa cup . `` in the champions league all three teams can either go through or go out but the one team that is in the best position is still chelsea . '' mourinho said it was important to keep his team 's results in perspective . `` do n't try to put pressure on me because i am never under pressure , '' he warned . `` we have lost one important game this week - at newcastle - and we 're out of the fa cup but i do n't think a defeat in a first-leg tie is a real defeat . we are just 2-1 down at half-time . '' asked if his chelsea honeymoon was now over , mourinho replied : `` i have had 20 years of honeymoons with my wife . `` the day that this club is not happy with me is the day that i go . ''
