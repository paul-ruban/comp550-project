dvd review : harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban this third harry potter film brought a change of director and a dramatic visual shake-up that really shines on dvd . gone are the warm , bright colours found in the two earlier films , alfonso cuaron brings in a bleak and cold feel that is simply gorgeous - and looks even better here than in the cinema . it is all part of the progression of harry 's story into darker areas , but you 'll spend time just marvelling at the beautiful hogwarts landscape . this is the first potter film where you get so lost in the screen adaptation that you forget the book . it is the third year at hogwarts and studies are interrupted , as they always are , by a calamity that only harry , ron and hermione can put right . it sounds corny . but harry is no longer the winsome hero , he is a moody teenager and daniel radcliffe pulls it off very well . emma watson is ever better as hermione , and the young stars are joined by the usual myriad famous actors including gary oldman and emma thompson . the film itself is the reason to buy this dvd . but it is laden with behind-the-scenes extras , including funny , if shallow , interviews with all the main cast . but what seems like a long list of features can be swiftly whittled down to the few that you are going to watch . younger viewers will go for the games which include a magic you may have missed memory test , and crookshanks chasing off after scabbers . adult viewers will ignore those and go straight to the deleted scenes . you will understand why they were deleted but it is fun to see more footage - and not have to hunt through endless menus to find it , as we did on the first harry potter dvd . the most interesting pieces are an interview with jk rowling in creating the vision and conjuring a scene , a short featurette about the making of the film 's big moments .
