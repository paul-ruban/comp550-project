johnson accuses british sprinters former olympic champion michael johnson has accused britain 's top sprinters of lacking pride and ambition . `` at the moment , the biggest factor on the mind of british sprinters is to be number one in britain , '' the world 200m and 400m record holder told five live . `` athletics at the moment is all about international competitions and they need to show a little more pride . '' however , linford christie countered : `` it 's easy to criticise when you have n't gone through the system here . '' johnson was involved in a verbal spat with britain 's darren campbell earlier this year . the american had cast doubt on campbell 's claims he had torn a hamstring in the wake of his failure to reach the olympic 100m and 200m finals . and the american remains highly critical of aspects of british sprinting . `` the only time you see british sprinters getting upset or riled is when there is a debate as to which one is better than the other , '' he claimed . `` athletes here have to compete more outside the uk . their focus has to be on being the best in the world and not just on being the top british sprinter . '' speaking at an elite coaches ' conference in birmingham , johnson also argued that although there has been more investment in the sport in britain , it had not necessarily reaped the rewards . `` you ca n't fix everything with money , '' he admitted . `` you contrast the situation here to that of some us athletes who have no funding . `` those who are n't funded might be hungrier and more motivated because their road to success is a lot more difficult and challenging . `` so when they get to the top they are more appreciative .
