hollywood hunts hits at sundance the sundance film festival , the movie industry 's top destination for uncovering the next independent hits and new talent , opens on thursday . the event will see screen executives decamp from hollywood to park city , utah , for 11 days to search for low-key movies that could make it big in 2005 . open water , napoleon dynamite , garden state and super-size me were all snapped up at last year 's festival . but stars like keanu reeves and pierce brosnan also have films showing there . the festival is being opened by a screening of quirky comedy happy endings , starring former friends actress lisa kudrow and maggie gyllenhaal , on thursday . kudrow 's friends co-star , david schwimmer , plays a divorced drunkard in duane hopwood , while brosnan stars as a hit man in comedy the matador . keanu reeves appears in coming-of-age tale thumbsucker while kevin costner and michael keaton are among the other big names whose films are involved . robert redford founded sundance in 1981 and it has gone on to showcase future successes such as reservoir dogs , the blair witch project and the full monty . but it has received criticism that it has become more commercial and mainstream over the years . `` as much as the press argues that sundance has completely changed , it has n't changed that much , '' festival director geoffrey gilmore said . `` it 's still a place for discovery . it 's a place for common ground among film-makers and audiences more than it is the celebrity stuff . '' other films generating interest before this year 's festival include hustle & flow , about an aspiring rapper , the squid and the whale , an autobiographical film by writer-director noah baumbach , and comedy/drama pretty persuasion . it also has two new international cinema competitions .
