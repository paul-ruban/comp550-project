takeover offer for sunderland fc bob murray , chairman of sunderland fc , has launched a â£1.5m ( $ 2.8m ) bid for the club after buying broadcaster bskyb 's stake in the business . mr murray is already sunderland 's leading shareholder , holding a 37.6 % stake , and now hopes to take full control of the championship side . mr murray said the club would find it easier to attract more investment by having a single majority owner . sunderland delisted its shares from the stock market in august . a lifetime sunderland supporter and board director since 1984 , mr murray agreed to buy bskyb 's 4.76 % holding in the wearside club on tuesday - taking his stake to 42.3 % . under stock market rules , mr murray is required to make an offer for the remaining shares that he does not already own at the same price paid for the bskyb holding of 31p a share . should the offer be fully accepted , mr murray said he expected to pay a maximum of â£1.53m for the remaining shares . he also stressed that fans who wanted to keep in touch with the club 's financial affairs could retain a small number of shares , enabling them to attend annual meetings . `` the football sector is experiencing significant changes and uncertainty , '' mr murray said in a statement . `` the recent speculation surrounding malcolm glazer and manchester united has shown the unsettling effect possible where there are a number of disparate interests , '' he added . `` i believe that this offer will strengthen the company and remove the potential for that type of uncertainty . '' sunderland were relegated from the premiership in 2003 but are currently pushing for promotion . the club managed to reduce its losses last year from â£20.6m to â£1.2m after selling a host of leading players . however , the club 's turnover dropped sharply from â£42.5m to â£28.5m over the same period , because of a fall in broadcast revenues . bskyb bought its stake in sunderland in 1999 as part of a five year media partnership deal . the deal expired last month .
