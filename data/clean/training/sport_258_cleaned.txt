spain coach faces racism inquiry spain 's football federation has initiated disciplinary action against national coach luis aragones over racist comments about thierry henry . if found guilty aragones could lose his job or face a fine of about â£22,000 . the federation had initially declined to take action against aragones after comments he made during a national team training session in october . but its president angel maria villar changed his mind after a request by spain 's anti-violence commission . aragones insisted the comments , made to henry 's arsenal club-mate jose antonio reyes , were meant to motivate the player , and were not intended to be offensive . `` i never intended to offend anyone , and for that reason i have a very easy conscience , '' he said at the time . `` i 'm obliged to motivate my players to get the best results . `` as part of that job , i use colloquial language , with which we can all understand each other within the framework of the football world. `` england 's players made a point of wearing anti-racism t-shirts when training before their friendly against spain in madrid last month . but the storm increased following racist chanting by spanish fans at england 's black players during the game , which spain won 1-0 . spain 's minister of sport jaime lissavetzky was quick to give his backing to the federation 's decision . `` everyone who has a public function has to consider their declarations , and make sure they do not give a negative image , '' he said . `` we are going to have zero tolerance in questions of racism .
