early elvis recordings go on sale some of elvis presley 's earliest recordings - including takes of all shook up - are going under the hammer on sunday at a los angeles auction . the six unedited reel-to-reel tapes - which were owned by the engineer who recorded them - are valued at up to $ 50,000 ( â£29,000 ) . highlights of the two hour-long collection will get their public debut at bonhams auction house on saturday . the rca tapes date from september 1956 to september 1957 . the `` pre-masters '' include a take of jailhouse rock , religious songs , material for his first christmas album , and banter between presley , members of his band and engineer thorne nogar . `` we 've had them for a lot of years , and i think the people should enjoy them , '' nogar 's son stephen , 57 , said . `` and frankly , we could use the money . '' nogar , who died in 1994 aged 72 , always used to make two tapes of sessions as a back-up in case rca producers wanted to make late changes to songs . `` he called them his ass-saver tapes , '' his son said . the quality is said to be noticeably crisper than that of a new vinyl record . because the family does not own the copyright to the music , the tapes can only be sold for `` personal enjoyment '' and they can not be copied for commercial gain .
