Fockers retain film chart crown Comedy Meet The Fockers has held on to the number one spot at the North American box office for a second week . It took $ 42.8m ( Â£23.7m ) at the weekend , making its overall takings more than $ 163m ( Â£90m ) in 12 days , according to studio estimates . It took $ 19.1m ( Â£9.9m ) on Christmas Day alone , the highest takings on that day in box office history . The sequel to the Ben Stiller comedy Meet The Parents stars Robert De Niro , Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand . The success of Meet the Fockers could help produce record box office revenue for 2004 , said Paul Dergarabedian , president of the industry 's tracker Exhibitor Relations . `` We 've had a much stronger than anticipated final week of the year that helped the industry end on a high note , '' said Mr Dergarabedian . Meet the Fockers also broke the box office records for the most money taken on New Year 's Eve , when it made $ 12.2m ( Â£6.2m ) , and New Year 's Day , when it took $ 18m ( Â£9.4m ) . The previous New Year 's Eve record was set in 2000 by Cast Away with $ 8.5m ( Â£4.5m ) . The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King had held the New Year 's Day title with $ 12.8m ( Â£6.7m ) . However , Christmas takings were down 26.5 % on 2003 's figures - which was blamed on Christmas falling over a weekend this year . This weekend 's top 12 films took an estimated $ 125.4m ( Â£65.8m ) , a 4.3 % increase on the same weekend last year . But there were no major releases last week to provide competition to Meet the Fockers or Lemony Snicket 's A Series of Unfortunate Events , which finished in second place with $ 14.7m ( Â£7.7m ) . The Aviator , starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes , ended up in third position after taking $ 11.2m ( Â£5.9m ) . Comedy Fat Albert - co-written by Bill Cosby - moved down the chart to fourth place after taking $ 10.7m ( Â£5.6m ) .
