barclays shares up on merger talk shares in uk banking group barclays have risen on monday following a weekend press report that it had held merger talks with us bank wells fargo . a tie-up between barclays and california-based wells fargo would create the world 's fourth biggest bank , valued at $ 180bn ( â£96bn ) . barclays has declined to comment on the report in the sunday express , saying it does not respond to market speculation . the two banks reportedly held talks in october and november 2004 . barclays shares were up 8 pence , or 1.3 % , at 605 pence by late morning in london on monday , making it the second biggest gainer in the ftse 100 index . uk banking icon barclays was founded more than 300 years ago ; it has operations in over 60 countries and employs 76,200 staff worldwide . its north american divisions focus on business banking , whereas wells fargo operates retail and business banking services from 6,000 branches . in 2003 , barclays reported a 20 % rise in pre-tax profits to â£3.8bn , and it has recently forecast similar gains in 2004 , predicting that full year pre-tax profits would rise 18 % to â£4.5bn . wells fargo had net income of $ 6.2bn in its last financial year , a 9 % increase on the previous year , and revenues of $ 28.4bn . barclays was the focus of takeover speculation in august , when it was linked to citigroup , though no bid has ever materialised . stock market traders were sceptical that the latest reports heralded a deal . `` the chief executive would be abandoning his duty if he did n't talk to rivals , but a deal does n't seem likely , '' reuters quoted one trader as saying .
