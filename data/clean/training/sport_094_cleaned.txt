lewis-francis turns to christie mark lewis-francis has stepped up his preparations for the new season by taking advice from british sprint icon linford christie . the 22-year-old is set to compete at sheffield this weekend and will then take on maurice greene and kim collins in birmingham on 18 february . `` training in wales and getting advice from linford christie is broadening my mind , '' said lewis-francis . the sprinter has also shed weight since winning relay gold at the athens games . `` last year i was 91kg , now i am 86.9kg - hopefully my times will come down , '' he said . `` this has been brought about by eating the right foods and cutting out the snacks . it is just discipline and being more focused about what i am doing . `` i am still keeping up my weights work and i can see the improvement in my running . '' despite playing his part in britain 's successful 4x100m relay team , lewis-francis still feels the frustration of missing out on the individual 100m final at the 2004 olympics . `` that was heartbreaking , but i had made it to the semi-final and for me , on a personal level , that was an achievement . `` i just have to be patient and build up for the next olympics . that is my goal and whatever i do between now and then will be geared to making the final .
