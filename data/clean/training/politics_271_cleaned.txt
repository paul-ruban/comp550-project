tory leader unveils spending plan tory leader michael howard says his party can save â£35bn in government spending by tackling waste . the money would be ploughed back into frontline services like the nhs and schools with the rest used to cut government borrowing and reduce taxes . the tory leader has also shrugged off the defection of one of his mps , robert jackson , a former minister , to labour . mr howard said that these things happened in politics and it would not affect the outcome of the election . `` let 's be realistic - the election is not going to be decided on the basis of what mr jackson did '' , he told bbc 1 's breakfast with frost programme . however the defection on saturday has cast a shadow over the launch of the conservatives ' spending plans . fuller details are due to be unveiled on monday . the bulk of the â£35bn saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services , mr howard said . the â£12bn left over would then be spent on reducing government borrowing , he added . however , the remainder would deal with some of the `` unfair taxes '' . `` almost every independent expert says if you get another labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes , '' mr howard insisted . `` because borrowing is going up , it is out of control , that is bound to lead to higher taxes or higher interest rates or both . `` so part of the â£12bn we are going to apply to filling the government 's black hole , reducing the borrowing . `` the rest will be used to reduce these unfair taxes which are bearing so heavily on the people of our country today . '' mr howard is expected to say that around â£6bn will be available for tax cuts when he makes his announcement on monday . the cuts will be paid for out of the savings identified by business trouble-shooter david james . home office spending could be cut by â£1.6bn , according to the final instalment of his year-long review . savings of â£153m at the foreign office and â£336m at the department for culture media and sport , have also been identified . in all , almost a quarter of a million jobs and 168 public bodies would go under mr james ' proposals . mr howard said : `` all this adds up to a bottom line and the bottom line is at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair , who will waste more and tax more , and a conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less . '' however , chief treasury secretary paul boateng said : `` none of the tories ' figures add up so they ca n't make these savings and ca n't pay for any tax cuts , which means the only guaranteed cut from the tories is â£35bn of cuts , hitting frontline public services hard . '' liberal democrat leader charles kennedy added : `` people will not be taken in by michael howard 's claims of â£35bn worth of savings . `` this ca n't be achieved without drastic cuts in local services in their own communities . '' a poll for the news of the world newspaper suggests the conservatives are on course for their worst election defeat in a century . labour will hold key marginal constituencies , winning a majority of 160 , the populus survey suggests . and the liberal democrats will take three key seats from the conservatives , leaving the tories with just 163 mps , two less than they returned atlabour 's 1997 landslide and their worst showing since 1906 .
