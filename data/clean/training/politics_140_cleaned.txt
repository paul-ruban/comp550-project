uk helps raped rwandan women britain is to give a â£4m grant to help women survivors of the rwandan genocide who were raped and often deliberately infected with hiv/aids . an estimated 25,000 girls and women were raped during the 1994 genocide . about 800,000 tutsis and moderate hutus were killed by hutu militias after the assassination of an ethnic hutu leader . the five-year department for international development funding will enable more survivors to have access to anti-retroviral treatment . the plight of the infected women was overshadowed for a long time . it was overshadowed by rwanda 's emergence from the 100 days of slaughter , during which time the mass killings took place , and the women 's fate was largely a taboo subject . but many of the women were widowed and they now not only have their own children to care for but , in many cases , orphans too . as the women die , the number of rwanda 's orphans rises . until recently , very few of the women have had access to anti-retroviral treatment . that is now starting to change . this funding is intended to make anti-retrovirals and other care available for some 2,500 women . mary kayitesi blewitt , founder of the survivors fund ( surf ) , one of the organisations through which the funds are being channelled , said it was a recognition , before it was too late , that the survivors should be a priority for help .
