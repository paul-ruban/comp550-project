e-university 'disgraceful waste' a failed government scheme to offer uk university courses online has been branded a `` disgraceful waste '' by mps . the e-university was scrapped last year , having attracted only 900 students at a cost of â£50m . chief executive john beaumont was paid a bonus of â£44,914 , despite a failure to bring in private sector backers . the commons education select committee called this `` morally indefensible '' but the government said the e-university project had `` improved understanding '' . a department for education and skills spokeswoman said the venture had been `` ambitious and ground-breaking , but take-up had not been `` sufficient to continue with the project '' . she added : `` uk e-universities was not the only organisation to have lost out on private sector investment in the collapse of the dotcom boom . '' the select committee found that those responsible for founding the e-university in 2000 had been caught up in the `` general atmosphere of enthusiasm '' surrounding the internet . initial business plans forecast a quarter of a million students joining within a decade , bringing in at least â£110m in profit . but virtually no market research was carried out and just â£4.2m was spent on worldwide sales and marketing of courses . some â£14m went on developing the technology to make the e-university work . this was used by just 200 students , the rest preferring to work through existing university websites . with no significant private investors and no direct accountability to a government minister , the e-university had had `` too much freedom to spend public money as it wished '' , the report found . committee chairman barry sheerman said : `` uk e-university was a terrible waste of public money . `` the senior executives failed to interest any private investors and showed an extraordinary over-confidence in their ability to attract students to the scheme . '' the report warns that the government should not be scared off investment in innovative but potentially risky schemes by the failure of the e-university , but `` should learn the lessons from this disaster '' .
