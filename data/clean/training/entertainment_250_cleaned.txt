Prince crowned 'top music earner' Prince earned more than any other pop star in 2004 , beating artists such Madonna and Elton John in US magazine Rolling Stone 's annual list . The singer banked $ 56.5m ( Â£30.4m ) from concerts , album and publishing sales with his Musicology tour and album . He kept Madonna in second place , as she earned $ 54.9m ( Â£29.5m ) while embarking on her global Re-Invention Tour . Veterans Simon and Garfunkel were in 10th place , their comeback tour helping them earn $ 24.9m ( Â£13.4m ) last year . `` Prince returned to centre stage after a decade in the commercial wilderness , '' the magazine reported . The singer 's 2004 tour took $ 90.3m ( Â£48.5m ) in ticket sales and he sold 1.9 million copies of his latest album Musicology . Although she grossed more than Prince last year , Madonna remained in second place because of the `` monumental '' production costs of her tour .

They were ahead of Sir Elton John , who took fourth place and almost $ 42.7m ( Â£23m ) from performances including a debut on the Las Vegas Strip . Other seasoned performers in the list included Rod Stewart , whose sold-out shows and third volume of The Great American Songbook covers album helped net him Â£35m ( Â£19m ) . The highest-ranking rap act in the list was 50 Cent , who at number 19 took $ 24m ( Â£13m ) to the bank .
