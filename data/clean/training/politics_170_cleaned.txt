hospital suspends 'no welsh ' plan an english hospital has suspended plans to stop treating welsh patients who have waited more than three months . hereford county hospital had earlier said that from the new year patients waiting longer than this would be taken off waiting lists for hip and knee operations . gps in wales had feared patients could be pushed to the back of another queue . but after talks with powys health board the hospital called off its plan until health chiefs meet early in january . hereford hospital trust caused an outcry when it sent out a letter telling patients that for financial and administrative reasons it planned to turn down some orthopaedic patients . shocked health officials in powys said this meant they would be left with the prospect of patients and doctors having to find new appointments in other hospitals . andy williams , chief executive of powys local health board , had said it was `` a totally unacceptable way to behave '' . mr williams had said he did not think it was a welsh-english issue , but said hereford hospital was `` struggling financially and trying to pass the problem back to powys '' . he had told bbc radio wales : `` i have written straight back to the trust ... to insist they withdraw this threat and treat the patients i am paying them to treat . '' but after the hospital had agreed to the suspension , mr williams said he was optimistic a compromise could be reached which would ensure welsh patients continued to be treated there . he said the problem had been caused by the difference in waiting time targets between england and wales . the target is 12 months for welsh patients , but just three months in england . the contract with the powys health board was worth â£7m a year for the hospital and accounts for 12 % of its patients . in a statement before the suspension of the idea , the welsh assembly government said the situation was `` unacceptable '' . `` but powys local health board is committed to ensuring our patients receive the care that is appropriate , '' said the assembly government . `` although we will be challenging hereford 's decision we will put in place appropriate care for our patients . they will be contacted by their gps in the next week . '' earlier , david rose , chief executive of hereford hospitals nhs trust , had said : `` it is with real regret that we have taken this step . `` we want to continue providing an excellent and fast service to powys people but can only do this if we are paid to provide the service . `` in 2005 our waiting time will fall to a maximum of 6-months and we want powys people to ask to be referred to our modern hospital . `` we appeal to powys local health board to allow powys people to choose hereford for their treatment .
