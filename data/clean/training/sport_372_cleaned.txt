wru proposes season overhaul the welsh rugby union wants to restructure the northern hemisphere season into four separate blocks . the season would start with the celtic league in october , followed by the heineken cup in february and march , and the six nations moved to april and may . after a nine week break , the wru then proposes a two-month period of away and home international matches . wru chairman david pickering said the structure would end problems of player availability for club and country . he added : `` we feel sure that spectator interest would respond to the impetus of high intensity rugby being played continuously rather than the fragmented timetable currently in operation . `` equally , we suspect that the sponsors would prefer the sustained interest in a continuous tournament and hopefully , the broadcasters would also enjoy increased exposure . '' moving the six nations from its traditional february beginning should also ensure better weather conditions and `` stimulate greater interest in the games and generally provide increased skills and competition and attract greater spectator viewing '' , pickering argued . the plan will be put before the international rugby board next month , where four other plans drawn up by independent consultants for a global integrated season will also be discussed . pickering added : `` it 's very early days and there are a number of caveats associated with it - not least the revenue from the broadcasters , which is extremely important . `` we 've got a good plan and one which should be judged on its merits .
