campbell lifts lid on united feud arsenal 's sol campbell has called the rivalry between manchester united and the gunners `` bitter and personal '' . past encounters have stirred up plenty of ill-feeling between the sides and they meet again at highbury on tuesday . `` it is just more bitter and personal against united , '' the defender told the guardian newspaper . `` there 's an edge . `` after all that has happened , if we beat them it will be one of our sweetest ever wins , especially because of how we lost to them up there . '' last october , arsenal lost 2-0 at old trafford , which ended a record 49-match unbeaten league run and sparked a mini-crisis , with the gunners winning only three of their next 10 games . `` it had a psychological impact on us , but again because of the way we were defeated , '' added the 30-year-old , referring to a controversial penalty award for united 's first goal . `` that was far more upsetting , losing like that , because they just seem to get away with it . you try and balance out over the course of a season but i 've had so many rough decisions against them you begin to wonder . '' with tensions spilling over afterwards - united boss sir alex ferguson was allegedly pelted with pizza in the players ' tunnel - there is little surprise that so much is riding on the return encounter on . `` everyone at arsenal has been waiting for this game , '' said campbell . `` we are up for this one . '' speaking on his long-term plans , campbell signalled his intent to move abroad before he turns 35 . `` i 'm 30 now and in five years ' time i wo n't be in this country - that 's definite . `` italy looks good to me because it would suit my kind of football . spain is an option but the idea of tasting a new culture and learning another language excites me the most . i 'm starting a little with french , of course .
