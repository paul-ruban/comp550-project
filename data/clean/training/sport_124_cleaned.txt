ferdinand casts doubt over glazer rio ferdinand has said he is unsure of malcolm glazer 's motives after the american billionaire launched a new offer to buy manchester united . the club have confirmed that the glazer family partnership have submitted proposals of a third bid . `` a lot of people want the club 's interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and have got its interests at heart , '' said ferdinand . `` no one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table . '' the central defender added on bbc radio five live : `` we will have to wait and see what glazer comes with . `` i would like to see the situation resolved either way . `` i think people are getting bored with him coming in and out of the news with new proposals . `` the other stuff off the pitch takes the shine off what is going on the pitch . '' glazer , currently owns a 28.1 % stake in the club , and united 's statement to the stock exchange said : `` the board has noted the recent press speculation on this subject . `` the board can confirm that it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various pre-conditions which may form the basis of an offer for manchester united from glazer . `` a further announcement will be made in due course . '' glazer 's previous bids for the club , which united supporters opposed , were rejected by the board because of the high level of debt they would incur . but it is believed that glazer has substantially reduced the borrowing required for his latest move . he will still need the approval of major shareholders john magnier and jp mcmanus , who own 28.9 % of the club to succeed . but the irish duo have cut off talks with glazer over the proposed sale of their stake , while fans remain opposed to his involvement .
