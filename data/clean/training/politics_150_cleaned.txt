galloway plea for hostage release ex-labour mp george galloway has appealed for the release of aid worker margaret hassan , kidnapped in iraq . mrs hassan , 59 , who led care international operations in iraq , was abducted in baghdad on 19 october . mr galloway was expelled from the labour party because of his staunch opposition to the war on iraq . he denied an earlier report that he planned to make a direct appeal to the kidnappers via the al-jazeera arabic television channel . speaking in london on saturday at the first annual delegate conference of his newly-founded party , the respect coalition , he said : `` i have deliberately not involved myself before in any of these situations . `` but this woman has been a prominent opponent of both the war and the preceding years of sanctions . `` i am prepared to do anything i can to help save her life . '' a spokesman later said mr galloway had friends in common with ms hassan , who he described as a prominent anti-war activist , and that he was `` willing to do anything - go to iraq or be an intermediary or anything that 's necessary '' . since her abduction , several videos of mrs hassan have been broadcast by al-jazeera . the latest footage showed mrs hassan asking for british troops to be pulled out of iraq . she also urged care international , the aid agency she works for , to close its office in baghdad , and appealed for iraqi women prisoners to be freed . care has since closed down all its operations in iraq .
