sfa awaits report over mikoliunas the scottish football association is awaiting referee hugh dallas 's report before acting against hearts winger saulius mikoliunas . mikoliunas , 20 , barged linesman andy davis , who had advised dallas to award rangers an injury-time penalty in hearts 's 2-1 defeat at tynecastle . `` he was sent off for violent conduct in the 90th minute but we do n't know if he did something else after the whistle . `` we do n't know how many red cards he was shown , '' said an sfa statement . hearts could also face action after three fans were arrested for throwing coins on the pitch . rangers ' striker dad prso was also sent off during the same incident when he received a second yellow card for wrestling the ball away from craig gordon and leaving the hearts keeper on the ground . the sfa said : `` once the referee 's report comes in then we 'll immediately look at things . `` we do n't normally get the reports until a couple of days after the game but we 're well aware of what happened here . `` prso was sent off for two cautions , and that will just be a one-match suspension . '' the sfa is certain to come down hard on mikoliunas after southampton 's david prutton was banned for 10-games on wednesday by the english fa for shoving referee alan wiley . hearts ' boss john robertson said : `` mikoliunas has thrown his chest against the assistant referee 's chest and got a red card for it . `` the officials have got to take into account the fact he 's a young lad . `` but people have got to take into account why he was incensed . why were 10,000 hearts fans incensed ? `` why did nobody from the rangers ' bench claim for a penalty kick ? '' rangers ' boss alex mcleish accepted referee dallas had no option but to send prso off . mcleish said : `` i 'm glad to see the spirit of the players fighting to the very end - literally with dado trying to get the ball back from craig gordon . `` but it was over-zealousness and i do n't think hugh had any option .
