dallaglio eyeing lions tour place former england captain lawrence dallaglio still harbours hopes of a place on the british and irish lions tour to new zealand . lions coach sir clive woodward has made it clear he will pick his squad to tour next summer based on form shown in the six nations championship . but dallaglio , who called time on england earlier this year , said : `` i assure you i would n't let anyone down . `` i know what it takes and what i have to offer , '' he told the daily telegraph . dallaglio toured south africa with the lions in 1997 but was forced home early with a knee injury from the trip to australia three years ago . the 32-year-old also felt concentrating on club rugby could have prolonged his international shelf-life . he said : `` i 'll be in good shape and fresh without another 10 tests on the clock . `` from what i witnessed at close quarters on sunday in our heineken cup match against leicester , i certainly did n't feel out of place alongside those players , many of whom will be on the trip . `` if i 'm fit and playing well , then i 'm most certainly available . `` if clive feels he has no need to look outside the international crop , then fine . if he does , then he wo n't need to look too far , will he ?
