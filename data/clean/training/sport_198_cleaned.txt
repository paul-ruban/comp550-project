edu describes tunnel fracas arsenal 's edu has lifted the lid on the scenes that followed manchester united 's win over the gunners . the brazilian confirmed tempers had flared but could shed no light on reports that food was thrown at united boss sir alex ferguson . `` i saw people being pulled apart , people pushing , pointing and shouting , '' he told uefa 's official website . `` the united players were trying to wind us up about the result but i did n't see any soup being thrown at anyone . '' however , edu tried to play down the incidents , adding : `` there was nothing that i have n't seen in brazilian derbies . `` derby matches in brazil are worse . i like to play in games like this with this intense rivalry . '' but edu was highly critical of the ferocity of some of united 's challenges during the game , particularly on jose antonio reyes . `` i think we were a lot fairer in the tackles than united , '' he said . `` reyes was being kicked all over the park - they were beating up the boy and gary neville was tackling in such a way that he should have been sent off . '' following the game , the football association said it would look into events in the tunnel . it also charged ruud van nistelrooy with serious foul play while arsenal boss arsene wenger has been asked to explain comments he made about the referee .
