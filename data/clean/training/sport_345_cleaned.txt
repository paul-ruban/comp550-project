wilkinson return 'unlikely' jonny wilkinson looks set to miss the whole of the 2005 rbs six nations . england 's world cup-winning fly-half said last week he was hoping to recover from his latest injury in time to play some role in the championship . but rob andrew , coach of wilkinson 's club side newcastle , said that with only two games left to play wilkinson was unlikely to be fit in time . `` it would be irresponsible to put him straight into a test match , '' andrew told the times . wilkinson is recovering from a knee injury which followed long-term neck and arm injuries . he has not played for england since the world cup final in november 2003 , since when the stuttering world champions have lost nine of their 14 matches . wilkinson is aiming to make his third start to the season in the zurich premiership match against harlequins on 13 march . that game is the day after england play italy in the six nations and six days before their final match of the championship against scotland . `` we are hoping jonny will be ready in a fortnight , but it is touch and go , '' said andrew . `` his recovery is going very well and the key now is how he is reintroduced to playing and with it goal-kicking . `` he will probably have to come off the bench to start and it would be ridiculous and irresponsible to put him straight back into a test match . `` we ca n't afford to get it wrong with a knee injury . we are in touch with england and they are relaxed about it . '' despite not playing for england , wilkinson is still hoping to make the lions tour to new zealand this summer . lions coach sir clive woodward has not set a deadline for when wilkinson has to start playing again in order to be considered for selection .
