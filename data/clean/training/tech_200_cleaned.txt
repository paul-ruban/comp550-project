computer grid to help the world your computer can now help solve the world 's most difficult health and social problems . launched this week , the world community grid will use idle computer time to test solutions to these problems . the donated processor cycles will help the wcg create virtual supercomputers via the net . the idea follows the success of other similar projects that have used the untapped processing power of millions of desktop pcs . one of the most successful collaboration projects was seti @ home , run by the search for extra terrestrial life project , which sorted through radio signals looking for signs of alien communication . anyone can volunteer to donate the spare time of their computers by downloading a special screensaver from the wgc website . once installed , the virtual terminal gets a chunk of the computational task to process , and reports back after completing that task . the first wcg problem being tackled will be the human proteome folding project , which hopes to identify the ways that the proteins in our body fold . the subjects of study are being selected by an international advisory board of experts specializing in health sciences , and technology . the body will evaluate proposals from leading research , public and not-for-profit organizations , and is expected to oversee up to six projects a year . organisations also represented on the board include the united nations development programme and the world health organisation . `` the world community grid will enable researchers around the globe to gather and analyze unprecedented quantities of data to help address important global issues , '' said elain gallin , program director for medical research at the doris duke charitable foundation . `` [ it ] will inspire us to look beyond the technological limitations that have historically restricted us from addressing some of our most intractable problems '' , she added . ibm has donated the hardware , software , technical services and expertise to build the basic infrastructure for the grid . the computer company , working with united devices , previously developed the smallpox research grid , which linked together more than two million volunteers from 226 countries to speed the analysis of some 35 million drug molecules in the search for a treatment for smallpox .
