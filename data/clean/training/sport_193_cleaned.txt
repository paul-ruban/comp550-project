'' the 28-year-old 's contract expires in the summer , but real want a quick deal . sivabaek added : `` i will be meeting real on wednesday . there is serious interest , but it is everton 's hands . '' everton must decide whether to cash in now on the denmark midfield man , or risk losing him for nothing in the summer . manager david moyes has defiantly claimed that he expects gravesen to still be at everton when the transfer window closes at the end of january . moyes said : `` i speak to tommy regularly and we know where we are at . `` there 's been no contact . we do n't want to lose him . '' real madrid general manager arrigo sacchi is the driving force behind the move , convincing vice-president emilio butragueno and new coach wanderley luxemburgo that gravesen is the right man for the bernabeu . everton must weigh up whether it is worth taking the money on offer for real and risk their own ambitions for european football . gravesen has been outstanding as everton have established themselves in the premiership 's top four this season .
