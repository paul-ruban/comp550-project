top tories on lib dem 'hit list' the liberal democrats are aiming to unseat a string of top tories - including leader michael howard - at the next general election . mr howard 's seat is at the top of the liberal democrats ' list . others targeted include oliver letwin , david davis and theresa may , lib dem 's elections chief lord rennard said . he said it was `` nothing personal '' but that `` very many of the prominent conservatives '' had slender leads in seats where the lib dems were second . in 2001 , michael howard won the folkestone & hythe seat with 20,645 votes , compared to 14,738 for the liberal democrat candidate peter carroll , giving the tory leader a majority of 5,907 . asked if this amounted to the party 's much vaunted `` decapitation strategy '' lord rennard said it was not a term he had ever used . but he urged labour supporters to vote tactically to remove prominent conservatives . `` i just do n't think labour voters in these sort of seats could resist the temptation to use their votes effectively to remove a conservative . '' he denied this strategy was opportunism , insisting the lib dem 's policies on issues such as tuition fees , the council tax and free care for the elderly appealed `` to all sides of the political spectrum '' . `` we are in favour of tactical voting as long as the tactic is to vote liberal democrat , '' he added . a conservative spokesperson said : `` the liberal democrats can talk all they like about strategy . the problem the liberal democrats face is that a large number of lib dem voters do not agree with their policies . `` we will be pointing out how they are soft on crime , how they support higher taxes , their opposition to controlled immigration and support for giving europe more control over our lives '' .
