farrell saga to drag on - lindsay wigan chairman maurice lindsay says he does not expect a quick solution to the on-going saga of captain andy farrell 's possible switch to rugby union . leicester and saracens are leading the chase for the player , but lindsay told the bbc it was not yet a done deal . `` as well as the rugby football union , the league , the individual club and the england coaching team have a say , so it 's not a quick decision , '' he said . `` he 's given us 12 years service so if he wants to go , we 'd support him . '' the prospect of farrell switching codes has been the main talking point of the super league season so far . `` it came as a bolt out of the blue to us , '' admitted lindsay . `` but he 's a very loyal friend to the club , so there 's no question that he 's deserting us . he just fancies a challenge . '' although the move would be a lucrative one for both farrell and wigan , lindsay said money was not a motivating factor for the club . `` the money side of things has n't been concluded , but it 's not the point for wigan , '' he told radio five live . `` a shortage of money has never been a problem for us . `` even if we did have it , under the salary cap we ca n't spend a penny of it anyway - we 'd rather have the player . '' lindsay also said he understood why rugby union was so interested in signing up farrell . `` it 'd be a great loss for us but a great boost for them , '' said the warriors chief . `` this guy is an absolute sporting icon . he 's been at the top for so long and has demonstrated so many attributes that you need to make it in a tough contact sport . `` athletes like him - ellery hanley and martin johnson - do n't come along very often . you 're very lucky to have them whilst you 've got them .
