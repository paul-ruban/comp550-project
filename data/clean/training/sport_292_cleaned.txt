wales coach elated with win mike ruddock paid tribute to his wales side after they came from 15-6 down to beat france 24-18 in the six nations . `` after going two tries down in 12 minutes we had to show character , '' said the national team coach . `` i did n't have to tell them anything at half-time because those players have stared down the barrel of a gun before . `` they decided they did n't want to do that again and came out fighting . it was a great team effort and we showed great character to come back . '' man-of-the-match stephen jones , who kicked three penalties , a drop goal and conversion , was ecstatic following after the win at stade de france . `` it 's just a special moment . two years ago we did n't win a single game in the six nations . but we 're a very happy camp now , '' he said . `` we worked hard as a squad and i 'm a proud welshman . we 've got hard matches to come , so we 're just happy with the start . '' double try scorer martyn williams was keen not to talk about a possible grand slam for wales . `` we 've got more self-belief these days . two or three years ago we might have collapsed after going behind so early . `` there 's no mention of a grand slam among the players . we 've got a tough game against scotland at murrayfield . they could bring us crashing down to earth .
