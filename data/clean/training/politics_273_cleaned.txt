'best person ' for top legal job the `` best person for the job '' should be appointed lord chancellor , and not necessarily a lawyer or mp , the courts minister has told mps . under reforms , the post of lord chancellor is to be stripped of its judicial functions . `` the lord chancellor ... no more needs to be a lawyer than the secretary of health needs to be a doctor , '' said courts minister christopher leslie . the constitutional reform bill was entering its second reading on monday . mr leslie said : `` the prime minister should be able to appoint the best person for the job whether they sit in the house of lords or the house of commons . '' under the reforms , the law lords will also be replaced as the uk 's highest legal authority by a supreme court and judges will be appointed by an independent panel rather than ministers . in december the lords rejected a plea by current lord chancellor lord falconer that the holder of the job should not necessarily be a lawyer or a peer . the peers voted by 229 to 206 to say in law that lord chancellors must also be peers . the debate was carried over from the last parliamentary session , but with an impending general election time is crucial for the government to get the bill passed . mr leslie said it was irrelevant whether the post was called secretary of state for constitutional affairs or lord chancellor . he said : `` what matters most is ... whether it is reformed so that the post holder no longer has those conflicting duties . `` it is no longer appropriate for a government minister to have such unfettered discretion in the appointment of judges . '' shadow attorney general dominic grieve criticised the government on its plans to change what he said was an `` exceptional institution , '' providing a `` champion of the independence of the judiciary '' . the government had initially proposed to take this institution and `` smash it to pieces , '' mr grieve said . convention should be `` nurtured and celebrated , '' but the government distrusted and disliked it instead . he warned that unless ministers backed down over the lord chancellor remaining a member of the house of lords , the government would have `` great difficulty '' in getting the bill through parliament . former cabinet minister douglas hogg , whose father and grandfather served as lord chancellor , said the bill was `` largely unnecessary , bureaucratic and expensive '' . but the tory mp for sleaford and north hykeham admitted the lord chancellor 's role and office `` can not be frozen in aspic '' .
