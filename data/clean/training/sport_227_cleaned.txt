wenger keeping faith with almunia arsene wenger has pledged to keep faith with stand-in keeper manuel almunia for the crunch week which could define arsenal 's season . almunia will start tuesday 's champions league group tie against rosenborg and is likely to face chelsea on sunday . wenger said : `` you do n't think i would take out one goalkeeper for just one game , do you ? i do n't do that . `` i have to give him a run for a few games . it 's just that i do n't want to make this story bigger than it is . '' wenger insists he has complete faith in the 27-year-old spaniard , who was signed last summer from celta vigo as back-up to jens lehmann . `` if you look at my career , you will see that i have left many big players out for a long time . i 've done it with dennis bergkamp , kanu , everybody . `` it 's because it 's a goalkeeper , that 's all . it 's a usual situation for me . you put your best team out , no matter who it is . `` for me , it was not a big mistake at old trafford and i was n't alarmed by what happened against birmingham either . `` it 's nothing against lehmann . i think he 's a great keeper , as is almunia . you can only play one of them . `` these people are not robots - they have good periods and less good periods . just because lehmann does n't play for two or three weeks , or longer or shorter , it does n't mean i 've lost faith in him . '' but former arsenal keeper david seaman believes lehmann has been harshly treated . seaman told the daily mail : `` jens is a fantastic keeper . he deserves another chance . `` he has made a few mistakes but on form he deserves to be the first-team choice . '' with arsenal hit by injuries and suspension , inexperienced midfield pair of mathieu flamini and cesc fabregas will line up against rosenborg but wenger is confident they will prove more than capable . `` it puts a lot of pressure on them but it 's a good learning process , '' said wenger . `` i 'm not worried as they are both mentally strong and will put in the needed workrate . '' the gunners go into the game boosted by the news that defender sol campbell is on the verge of signing a new deal with the club . and the 30-year-old , whose current contract runs out in the summer , has made it clear he is determined to achieve champions league success with arsenal . campbell said : `` it means a lot to me to go through , it 's everything . we want to carry on in this competition . `` that 's where the best teams in europe are . to be in there , playing against these guys and trying to win the trophy , is the first thing in my mind . '' meanwhile , thierry henry believes he will be blamed if arsenal fail to qualify for the next stage of the champions league . henry will captain the side in place of the suspended patrick vieira as the gunners seek the required victory over rosenborg . and the striker said : `` if we do n't win and we go out of the competition , like it or not , it 's going to be my fault . that 's the way it is . `` if the team do n't win i know i will be criticised , no matter how i play .
