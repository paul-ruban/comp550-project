beastie boys win sampling battle us rappers beastie boys have won their long-running battle over the use of a sample in their song pass the mic . the punk-rappers used three notes of music from flautist james newton 's choir in their track from 1992 . although the group had paid a licence fee for the sample , mr newton said his copyright had been infringed . but the us court of appeal upheld its original decision that the group did not have to pay an additional fee to license the underlying composition . the beastie boys - michael diamond , adam horowitz , and adam yauch - are considered to be one of early pioneers of sampling music . sampling , now a standard practice among musicians , involves taking a segment of one track and using it in a different song . a three-judge panel of the court held in 2003 that the band had abided by copyright protections by paying a licence fee for a sample of mr newton 's recording . that finding upheld a lower-court dismissal of the case in favour of the beastie boys . `` we hold that beastie boys ' use of a brief segment of that composition , consisting of three notes separated by a half-step over a background c note , is not sufficient to sustain a claim for infringement of newton 's copyright , '' chief judge mary schroeder wrote in her opinion . mr newton is a critically acclaimed jazz and classical flutist , composer , performer , and university professor . mr newton and the beastie boys were not available for comment .
