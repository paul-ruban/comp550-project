winemaker rejects foster 's offer australian winemaker southcorp has rejected a takeover offer worth 3.1bn australian dollars ( $ 2.3bn ; â£1.8bn ) from brewing giant foster 's group . southcorp , whose brands include penfolds , rosemount and lindemans , dismissed the offer as inadequate . the two companies held four days of talks after foster 's bought an 18.8 % stake in southcorp on 13 january . a merger would create a global player with worldwide annual sales of 39m cases and revenues of a $ 2.6bn . southcorp said foster 's a $ 4.17-a-share takeover proposal offered a `` excellent strategic fit '' but undervalued the company . `` southcorp 's board has informed foster 's that it is not prepared to recommend the offer as it does not adequately reflect the strategic value of the company , '' said southcorp chairman brian finn . southcorp said foster 's takeover offer was `` opportunistic '' . however , it said that the offer may represent an 'opening bid ' , opening up the possibility of foster 's returning with an improved offer . foster 's said a combination of the two companies would create a global player with an `` unrivalled '' collection of premium wine brands . despite being best known for brewing foster 's lager , foster 's is already one of australia 's largest wine producers , owning the beringer and wolf blass brands among others . `` the combination of foster 's and southcorp will transform the global wine industry and significantly enhance australia 's competitive position on the global stage , '' said trevor o'hoy , foster 's chief executive officer . foster 's spent a $ 584m on buying an 18.8 % stake in southcorp from the oatley family , which founded the rosemount estates business and later merged it into southcorp . shares in both companies were suspended while the two held talks about a deal . southcorp 's shares rose 12 % to a $ 4.76 on news of the offer but foster 's shares fell 3.7 % to a $ 5.44 .
