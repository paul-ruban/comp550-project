smart search lets art fans browse if you do n't know art but know what you like , new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting . artgarden , developed by bt 's research unit , is being tested by the tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings . rather than search by the name of an artist or painting , users are shown a selection of pictures . clicking on their favourite will change the gallery in front of them to a selection of similar works . the technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity , which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection . it 'chooses ' a selection of pictures , by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them . so , for instance a whistler painting of a bridge may have the obvious keywords such as bridge and whistler associated to it but will also widen the search net with terms such as aesthetic movement , 19th century and water . a variety of paintings will then be shown to the user , based partly on the keywords and partly on luck . `` it is much more akin to wandering through the gallery , '' said jemima rellie , head of the tate 's digital programme . for richard tateson , who worked on the artgarden project , the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration . `` i went to an online clothes store to find something to buy my wife for christmas but i did n't have a clue what i wanted , '' he said . the text-based search was restricted to looking either by type of garment or designer , neither of which he found helpful . he ended up doing his present shopping on the high street instead . he thinks the dominance of text-based searching is not necessarily appealing to the majority of online shoppers . similarly , with art , browsing is often more important than finding a particular object . `` you do n't arrive at tate britain and tell people what you want to see . one of the skills of showing off the collection is to introduce people to things they would n't have asked for , '' he said . the tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as artgarden can help with that , said ms rellie . she hopes the technology can be incorporated on to the website in the near future . bt research is looking at extending the technology to other searching , such as for music and films .
