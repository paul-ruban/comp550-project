download chart debut is delayed the inclusion of downloaded music in the official singles chart has been delayed for a month . the british phonographic industry ( bpi ) had planned to include download formats in the chart from 20 march . but the date has been put back to 17 april to create a `` level playing field '' for independent labels . the bpi is concerned that independent repertoire is not adequately represented online and said they were looking at ways of rectifying it . bpi chairman peter jamieson said : `` the inclusion of download formats in the official uk singles chart is the most significant development in the charts for 20 years . `` but for a multitude of reasons the current chart representation of independent repertoire at the major download outlets is poor . `` i am very pleased we have secured this delay on behalf of independents . we have to try and establish a realistic 'level playing field ' of opportunity . the official uk charts are run by the official uk charts company ( occ ) - a joint venture between the bpi and the british association of record dealers ( bard ) . at an occ board meeting on wednesday , the occ board agreed with bpi members that the 20 march start date be postponed . download formats will now be included in the official uk singles chart for the first time in the chart published on 17 april - the sales week beginning 10 april . the us has already merged downloaded singles into its billboard hot 100 chart .
