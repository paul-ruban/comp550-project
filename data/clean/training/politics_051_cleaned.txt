mps criticise child access system divorced parents seeking access to their children are often disadvantaged by the legal system , mps have said . the constitutional affairs select committee said parents with custody could exploit delays in the system to stop former partners gaining access . courts should be used as a last resort , but where they are , their orders should be enforced more rigorously , mps said . but they rejected the claim made by some campaign groups that there should be a legal presumption of equal access . currently the presumption is that the interests of the child are paramount . `` an arbitrary 'template ' imposed on all families , whatever the needs of the child , would relegate the welfare of individual children to a secondary position , '' the mps said . they said the law should be changed to require family courts specifically to take account of the importance of sustaining the relationship between the child and the non-resident parent in contested cases . this would `` reassert the rights of non-resident parents to contact with their children , as well as the rights of children to contact with both their parents , while maintaining sufficient flexibility to cope with issues of safety '' , they said . delays in court hearings and the inability to effectively enforce court orders allowed `` a new 'status quo ' arrangement for the children to become established by default '' , they said . `` although the courts rigorously avoid conscious bias , there are considerable grounds for accepting that non-resident parents are frequently disadvantaged by the system as it is administered at present . `` given the strong animosity between the parties which is common in contested family cases , we find it hard to believe that tactical delay is not sometimes used to the advantage of resident parents . '' committee chairman alan beith said the five-month inquiry had been a `` complex and emotive '' one . `` at the moment , far too many contact and residency cases are being dealt with by the courts when they could be better resolved through professional mediation and negotiation , '' he said . `` this situation has to change . the court system should only be used as a last resort , where mediation and negotiation have completely broken down or where issues of abuse or domestic violence need to be dealt with . `` this will help to reduce delays and improve the lives of many children across the country .
