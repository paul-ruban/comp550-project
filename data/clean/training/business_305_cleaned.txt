brazil approves bankruptcy reform a major reform of brazil 's bankruptcy laws has been approved by the country 's congress , in a move which it is hoped will cut the cost of borrowing . the bill , proposed in 1993 , has finally been approved by the leadership of president luiz inacio lula da silva . the old law , dating from 1945 , gave priority first to workers , second to tax revenue and finally to creditors . the new legislation changes this , giving priority to creditors and limiting payments to workers . the new regulations will limit payments to workers to 150 times the minimum monthly salary , which is currently $ 94 . the law also makes it more difficult for a company to declare bankruptcy . however , when a firm is declared bankrupt it will gain protection from creditors for 180 days while a recovery plan is worked out . the proposals were opposed in the past by leftist parties , including mr lula 's worker party . they considered that they undermined workers ' rights . but president lula became a defender of the reforms , arguing that the country 's bank lending margins were among the highest in the world and were damaging the economy . according to andreas adriano of latin trade magazine , the new bankruptcy law will help in reducing the spread - difference between the interest rates of the banks and federal bonds . nevertheless , mr adriano said to reduce the basic interest rate the central bank needs to change its policy , focusing not only on inflation but also on economic growth .
