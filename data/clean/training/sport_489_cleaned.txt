safin cool on wimbledon newly-crowned australian open champion marat safin has ruled out any chance of winning wimbledon in the future . after losing in round one last year , safin said he had `` given up '' on wimbledon and winning his second grand slam title has not changed his mind . `` i 'll play , but with no expectations . i feel like i ca n't waste my time , my energy on that surface , '' he said . `` some people , they can not play on clay . some people , they can not play on a hard court . me , i ca n't play on grass . '' however , safin is hopeful that winning the australian open will give him the belief he needs to win more grand slam titles . `` it 's a relief for me . two grand slams , it 's already something . but with this one i worked really hard for it , '' he said . `` basically , i would love to win a couple more . i think i have a chance if i continue this way . `` if ( coach ) peter lundgren will stick around with me and wants to work with me for a bit longer , i think i can make it . '' the 25-year-old shocked pete sampras in the 2000 us open final to win his first major title but then lost in two australian open finals . safin admitted he had begun to doubt whether he would win another grand slam . `` i did n't expect that ( to win the 2000 us open ) - it was against sampras , i was n't the favourite so i had no pressure whatsoever , '' he said . `` after the first final that i did n't win against thomas johansson ( in 2002 ) , i could n't see myself winning the grand slams anymore . `` i was once in the semi-finals of the french open , but i did n't believe i can win it . `` i just could n't handle the pressure . you need to believe in yourself , and i did n't . '' and after losing the first set 6-1 to lleyton hewitt in sunday 's final , safin said he began to doubt himself again . `` i am 25 . i 'm playing against hewitt . at least you have to have the opportunity to win it , at least have a chance , '' he said . `` it 's like you go there and you lose first set 6-1 , then you start to think : 'this is not my day . the way i 'm playing is ridiculous . ' `` but then you start to really be a little bit more selfish and try to find a way out of there . `` and i found it . i was like really much i was much happier than in 2000 , that 's for sure , because i get over it .
