lib dems 'to target stamp duty' the liberal democrats are promising to raise the stamp duty threshold if they win the general election , in a bid to court first-time house buyers . vince cable , the party 's treasury spokesman , said raising the threshold to â£150,000 would prevent over 400,000 home-buyers from paying the tax . he said first-time buyers were being `` squeezed out '' of the housing market . the labour party said the liberal democrats needed to explain how they would pay for the plan . the plan forms part of a wider lib dems policy to encourage first time buyers and those on lower incomes into the market . under the proposals , the average saving for a new buyer would be more than â£1,000 , according to mr cable . `` first time buyers are being squeezed out of the housing market not only by higher house prices but also by being swept into the stamp duty net , '' he said . `` by failing to uprate the stamp duty threshold gordon brown has hit first time buyers and those on low incomes the hardest . `` by pledging to increase the threshold to â£150,000 , the liberal democrats will make it possible for many first time buyers to buy a property without facing this tax . '' paul boateng mp , labour 's chief secretary to the treasury , said : `` the lib dems ' sums do n't add up . `` they can have no credibility until they can say how they would fund their ever growing list of tax and spending commitments . '' mr cable will publish his `` alternative budget '' on monday .
