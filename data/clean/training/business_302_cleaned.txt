cactus diet deal for phytopharm a slimming aid made from a southern african cactus is set to be developed by uk firm phytopharm and unilever . anglo-dutch food giant unilever will help the pharmaceutical firm develop the snacks containing hoodia extract . phytopharm shares jumped 10.7 % on the news , with analysts saying sales of $ 600m ( â£309m ) a year were possible . the plant , licensed to phytopharm in 1997 , has been used for thousands of years by the sans bushmen of the kalahari desert to stave off hunger . studies have reportedly shown the plant curbs appetite instead of reducing calorific intake like many existing products . phytopharm will receive an initial fee of â£6.5m from unilever - out of a potential total of â£21m - as well as future royalties on product sales . under the deal , production of the hoodia cactus at phytopharm 's nursery in south africa will also rise from eight million plants to potentially hundreds of millions , said phytopharm chief executive richard dixey . the firm had initially hoped to market a slimming drug from hoodia with pfizer . but the research collaboration came to an end in 2003 . analysts said unilever could launch the new products in 2007 . `` this deal goes a long way to restoring the market faith in phytopharm 's pipeline after the pfizer exit , '' said analyst erling refsum at nomura .
