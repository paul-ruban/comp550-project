golden rule boost for chancellor chancellor gordon brown has been given a â£2.1bn boost in his attempts to meet his golden economic rule , which allows him to borrow only for investment . the extra leeway came after the office for national statistics said it had been measuring road expenditure data wrongly over the past five years . it comes just weeks ahead of the budget and an expected general election . shadow chancellor oliver letwin said : `` at best the timing of these changes is very convenient for the government . '' a review by the ons found it had made a mistake by `` double counting '' some spending on roads since 1998/9 . correcting the error would mean reducing current expenditure and increasing net investment , thus helping mr brown to meet his `` golden rule '' of borrowing only to invest over the economic cycle . economists speculated that it might also allow for some vote-catching measures in the budget . the changes by the ons increase the current budget measure for the past five years by â£2.1bn in total . mr letwin said : `` this is a very murky area ... there will inevitably be suspicions that the figures are being fiddled . '' the conservatives also said mr brown would still be forced to raise taxes after the general election to fill an annual â£10.5bn `` black hole '' in the nation 's coffers . but the treasury said there would be no relaxation of economic discipline and the golden rule would be met even without the data revisions . in january the independent institute for fiscal studies ( ifs ) said mr brown would need to raise taxes to get public finances onto the track predicted in last year 's budget . it also said the government might narrowly miss its `` golden rule '' if the current economic cycle ended in 2005/06 . after the ons announcement , economists said there could also be a proportionate boost to the current budget in 2004/05 of about â£400m . `` none of this changes the big picture of a dramatic deterioration in the overall fiscal position over the last four or five years , '' said jonathan loynes , chief uk economist at capital economics . `` accordingly , it seems very likely that some form of fiscal consolidation will be required in due course .
