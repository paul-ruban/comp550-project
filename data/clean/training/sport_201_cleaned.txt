wenger offers mutu hope arsenal boss arsene wenger would consider signing adrian mutu once the striker has served his drugs ban . mutu was sacked by chelsea on friday after testing positive for cocaine - a move wenger has backed . but he said : `` i do n't even wonder if that could happen because i think he will be suspended for a long period . `` but once he has served his suspension , he has the right again to start from zero . i would then meet the player and see what he tells me . '' mutu faces a ban of between six months and two years when the football association decides on his punishment . chelsea decided to act before his case was heard and sacked the striker on grounds of gross misconduct after it was revealed that he had failed a drug test . but mutu has hit out at the club 's decision , saying : `` chelsea have destroyed me . '' he told the sunday mirror : `` i do n't know what i 'm going to do . i am shocked and surprised by their decision . `` i did n't expect them to pay me while i was suspended but i never thought they would sack me either . `` why did n't they wait to do this ? now my career is in ruins . `` i might as well walk away from football . what is there left for me ? '' chelsea have been criticised for their stance , with the professional footballers ' association accusing the club of failing in their duty of care to the player . and mutu agreed , adding : `` it is unfair . if they were going to sack me they should have done it afterwards . `` why did they go public ? to make an example of me ? it makes it very difficult for me now .
