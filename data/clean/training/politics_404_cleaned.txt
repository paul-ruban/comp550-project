'' in a statement , the party said the comment had been taken out of context . `` he fully supports the party 's policies on , and approach to , the public services , '' said the statement . `` however , in order to avoid any further misrepresentation of his views and any damage to the party , he has decided not to stand in the sedgefield constituency at the next election . '' mr kruger is continuing in his job at the tory campaign headquarters . labour election coordinator alan milburn claimed mr kruger had exposed the tory agenda for â£35bn of cuts to public services . mr milburn said : `` he is not some unknown hopeful fighting an unwinnable seat . he is a man who has worked at the heart of conservative policy development ... `` his claim that the tories were planning ' a period of creative destruction in the public services ' is not a rogue claim . `` it is the authentic and shocking voice of the conservative party . it reveals the true picture of what they would do .
