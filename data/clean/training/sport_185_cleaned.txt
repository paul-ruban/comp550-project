candela completes bolton switch bolton boss sam allardyce has signed roma defender vincent candela on a five-month deal . the 31-year-old former france international gave his last press conference as a roma player on monday , anouncing his move to bolton . `` i have signed a five-month contract with bolton , '' said candela , who will travel to england on tuesday . `` in june i will decide whether to continue to play for bolton or retire from professional football . '' allardyce hopes candela 's arrival will relieve bolton 's injury crisis after defender nicky hunt limped out injured during oldham 's 1-0 win against oldham in the fa cup on sunday . `` in light of what has happened to nicky hunt , with his injury , it might be a blessing in disguise that we can bring in a highly-experienced full-back to help with our injuries at the back , '' allardyce said . `` he has an outstanding pedigree in the game and has won honours at the highest level including the world cup in 1998 . `` he has not played regular football this year but is eager to impress in the premiership . `` he can play in any position at the back and despite him being predominately right-footed he has played the majority of his career at left-back . '' candela , who was a member of the roma side that won the title in 2001 , has made only seven league appearances this season for luigi del neri 's side .
