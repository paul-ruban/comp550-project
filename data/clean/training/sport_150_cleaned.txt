jol joy at 'professional ' cup win tottenham manager martin jol acclaimed his players for their patience in their 3-0 fa cup fifth-round victory over a determined nottingham forest side . `` we had the initiative but it was n't easy . it was a professional sort of performance , '' the dutchman said . `` forest played with a lot of players behind the ball in the first half , but at 2-0 they were dead and buried . '' looking ahead to the quarter-final , jol said : `` newcastle have got a very good side and they are always difficult . '' however , he added that his side , who are four places above the magpies in the premiership , were `` not afraid of anyone '' . robbie keane , skipper for the night and scorer of the crucial second goal , echoed his manager 's sentiments on the last-eight match . `` they 're on a high , but we 're confident and in the last few games we 've played well and hopefully we can go there and get the win , '' he said . he conceded the win over forest , which included goals from noe pamarot and mido , was not pretty to watch . `` it was n't the best display but it 's all about the result , '' the irishman said . `` we knew it was going to be difficult with the conditions . the pitch was n't the best but we still tried to pass it . `` we dug in and the gaffer said to us at half-time to keep being patient and that the goal will come . '' forest manager gary megson conceded his team did not deserve anything after a poor performance . `` if you play like we did and concede two goals from corners you 're going to have an uphill battle against a very good team , '' he said . `` if we defend in the championship like we did we 'll not get another point . `` we were organised but i felt at times we thought the system would be enough but we did n't look like scoring .
