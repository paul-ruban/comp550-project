thanou bullish over drugs hearing katerina thanou is confident she and fellow sprinter kostas kenteris will not be punished for missing drugs tests before the athens olympics . the greek pair appeared at a hearing on saturday which will determine whether their provisional bans from athletics ' ruling body the iaaf should stand . `` after five months we finally had the chance to give explanations . i am confident and optimistic , '' said thanou . `` we presented new evidence to the committee that they were not aware of . '' the athletes ' lawyer grigoris ioanidis said he believed the independent disciplinary committee set up by the greek athletics federation ( segas ) would find them innocent . `` we are almost certain that the charges will be dropped , '' said ioanidis . `` we believe that we have presented [ a case ] that the charges are unreasonable . '' thanou , the 2000 olympic women 's 100m silver medallist , and sydney 200m champion kenteris were suspended by the iaaf for missing three drugs tests . the third was supposed to take place on the eve of the athens games last august , but the pair could not be found in the athletes ' village . they were later taken to hospital after claiming to have been involved in a motorcycle accident . thanou 's coach christos tzekos was also suspended by the iaaf . `` we were asked [ by the disciplinary committee ] all kinds of questions about the night of 12 august , '' said tzekos . `` we did not leave any gaps . as far as i am concerned there is no such issue [ of refusing to be tested ] , and i am very optimistic . '' tzekos , thanou and kenteris , who have all denied the charges , can expect a decision within a month . `` deliberations will start after some additional documents are brought in by thursday , '' said committee chairman kostas panagopoulos . `` i estimate that the final ruling will be issued by the end of february .
