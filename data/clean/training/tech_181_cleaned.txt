mobiles double up as bus tickets mobiles could soon double up as travel cards , with nokia planning to try out a wireless ticket system on german buses . early next year travellers in the city of hanau , near frankfurt , will be able to pay for tickets by passing their phone over a smart-card reader already installed on the buses . passengers will need to own a nokia 3220 handset which will have a special shell attached to it . the system would reduce queues and make travelling easier , said nokia . transport systems around the world are seeing the advantage of using ticketless smartcards . using a mobile phone is the next step , said gerhard romen , head of market development at nokia . the ticketless trial will start early in 2005 and people will also be able to access transport information and timetables via their phones . nokia has worked with electronics giant philips to develop a shell for the mobile phone that will be compatible with hanau 's existing ticketing system . the system opens up possibilities for mobile devices to be interact with everyday environments , said mr romen . `` it could be used in shops to get product information , at bus-stops to get information about the next bus or , for example , by being passed over an advert of a rock star to find out details of concerts or get ringtones , '' he told the bbc news website . he is confident that the trial being run in germany could be extended to transport systems in other countries . `` the technology offers access to a lot of services and makes it easy to get the information you want , '' he said .
