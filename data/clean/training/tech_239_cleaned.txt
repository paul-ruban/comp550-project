go-ahead for new internet names the internet could soon have two new domain names , aimed at mobile services and the jobs market . the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers ( icann ) has given preliminary approval to two new addresses - .mobi and .jobs . they are among 10 new names being considered by the net 's oversight body . others include a domain for pornography , an anti-spam domain as well as .post and .travel , for the postal and travel industries . the .mobi domain would be aimed at websites and other services that work specifically around mobile phones , while the .jobs address could be used by companies wanting a dedicated site for job postings . the process to see the new domain names go live in cyberspace could take months and icann officials warned that there were no guarantees they would ultimately be accepted . applicants paid â£23,000 apiece to have their proposals considered . the application for .mobi was sponsored by technology firms including nokia , microsoft and t-mobile . of the 10 currently under consideration , the least likely to win approval is the .xxx domain for pornographic websites . there are currently around 250 domain names in use around the globe , mostly for specific countries such as .fr for france and .uk for britain . perhaps unsurprisingly , .com remains the most popular address on the web .
