mcclaren hails boro 's uefa spirit middlesbrough boss steve mcclaren has praised the way his side have got to grips with european football after the 2-0 uefa cup win against lazio . boro , who are playing in europe for the first time in their 128-year history , are top of group e with maximum points . `` i think we have taken to europe really well , '' said mcclaren . `` we got about lazio , did n't let them settle or play . and in possession , we controlled it and looked threatening every time we went forward . '' before the match , mcclaren had said that a win over the italian giants would put boro firmly on the european footballing map . and after they did just that he said : `` it was a perfect european night . for the team to give the fans a performance like that was the icing on the cake . `` there have been many good performances but this was something special . `` you can see that the experience we have in the squad is showing . to win in europe you need to defend well , and we have done that because we have conceded only one goal in four games . `` we can also score goals , and again that is something you can see from the performances we have had , so we have good balance . mcclaren 's only criticism of his side was that their dominance should have been resulted in more goals . `` it should have been more convincing , '' said mcclaren . `` but i had watched lazio in recent weeks and i saw them score a late equaliser against inter milan on saturday so i knew we needed a second goal . `` no matter what anybody says , lazio are favourites to win this competition . '' middlesbrough forward boudewijn zenden said he did not expect such a comfortable match after he scored both goals . `` we did n't expect it to be that one-sided , '' said zenden . `` we did quite well in the first half , we pressured them and they did n't cope with that . `` i think we played quite well and it was a very good game , especially in the first half . '' the holland international said boro are confident of progressing in the competition after winning their first two group games . `` we 've got a very good feeling , there is a good spirit , all the lads work hard for each other and it 's a squad of friendly players , which i think you can see on the pitch , '' he added .
