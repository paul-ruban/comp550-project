Weak dollar hits Reuters Revenues at media group Reuters slipped 11 % during 2004 , mainly due to the weakness of the dollar , the group said . The company said it was optimistic about growth even as revenues slipped 11 % from Â£3.24bn ( $ 6.13bn ) in 2003 to Â£2.89bn in 2004 . Reuters beat profit forecasts , posting a 52 % rise in profits for the year to Â£198m from the Â£130m seen a year earlier . Reuters also beat its savings target for 2004 , delivering Â£234m of cuts . Under its three-year Fast Forward turnaround plan it had aimed to save Â£220m during the 12 months to 31 December . Reuters also managed to slow a decline in underlying revenues to 5.4 % from 10.2 % in 2003 and cut its debt back to Â£160m from Â£610m a year earlier . The news and financial data seller said the year had begun well , adding it expected `` further gradual improvement '' in the second quarter of the year after good January sales . It added it was planning to deliver a further Â£105m of savings over the coming year - but said it expects to be hit with an Â£80m restructuring charge to pay for the cost of moving from Fleet Street to new headquarters in London at Canary Wharf . `` Improving customer relationships , more competitive products and continued strong cost discipline position us well for 2005 , '' chief executive Tom Glocer said , adding the company was beginning `` to look beyond recovery to growth '' .
