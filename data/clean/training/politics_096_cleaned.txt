tories 'would cut number of mps' the conservative party would cut the number of mps by about one-fifth if they were elected , tory leader michael howard has said . the plan forms part of the party 's `` smaller government bill '' , to be unveiled later this week . mr howard told the sunday times the party would also reduce the number of government special advisers . and he said a referendum would be held in wales to decide whether or not to scrap the welsh assembly . the changes would all take place within five years of the conservatives winning a general election , mr howard told the paper . the precise number of mps to go would depend on the result of the welsh referendum , but it would probably mean a reduction of around 120 from the current total of 659 . if wales decided to keep its assembly it would stand to lose more mps . mr howard said as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at whitehall - labour by more than 80,000 and the tories by almost 100,000 - they should accept a similar drop in their own numbers . `` it is all very well saying government departments should be reduced , but what about ministers , parliament and special advisers ? '' he said . shadow leader of the commons oliver heald said : `` this will be part of our aim to reduce unnecessary and costly interference in people 's lives by reducing the size and role of the state '' . mr howard said the plan would also even out the `` great unfairness '' of there being proportionately more scottish and welsh mps at westminster than those from england . the average size of an english constituency was 70,000 people , mr howard said . in northern ireland it was just over 66,000 , in wales just over 59,000 and in scotland 53,000 . the number of welsh mps would be set at an amount that was `` consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the united kingdom '' if the assembly was scrapped . mr howard said the changes should be carried out quickly and could even be implemented by the election after next . `` you have got to have a big bang . we do n't want this like the house of lords reform , getting to one stage and then not having the next stage .
