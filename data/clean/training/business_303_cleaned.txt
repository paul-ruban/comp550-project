brazil plays down varig rescue the brazilian government has played down claims that it could step in to save the country 's biggest airline . brazil 's airport authority chief carlos wilson had claimed the government was on the brink of stepping in to save varig , brazil 's flagship airline . however , the country 's vice president jose alencar has said the government still is looking for a solution . varig is struggling under a huge debt burden of an estimated debt of 6.5 billion reais ( $ 2.3bn or â£1.2bn ) . asked whether a rescue was on the cards following a meeting of the country 's congress to discuss the airline 's crisis , mr alencar replied : `` no , i do n't think so . we will see . '' earlier , mr wilson had said that president luiz inacio lula da silva has decided to step in and a decree of some kind of intervention could be signed this week . `` in practice , it will be an intervention , although this is not the technical name used '' , he said . an intervention means that the government would take administrative control of the company and its finances . for that to happen varig 's main shareholder , the non-profit ruben berta foundation which represents the airline 's employees , would have to be removed , mr wilson said . however , no jobs would be lost and the airline would keep on flying , he added . varig , which operates in 18 countries apart from brazil , has been driven to the brink of collapse because of the country 's economic downturn . the depreciation of brazil 's currency has had a direct impact on the airline 's dollar debt as well as some of its costs . business has improved recently with demand for air travel increasing and a recovery in the brazilian economy . the airline could also win a sizeable windfall from a compensation claim against the government . on tuesday the courts awarded varig 2bn reais ( $ 725m ) , after ruling in favour of its compensation claim against the government for freezing tariffs from 1985 to 1992 . but the government can appeal the decision .
