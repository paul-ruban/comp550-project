new ukip defection to 'veritas' the uk independence party has lost one of its two london assembly members to robert kilroy-silk 's new political party , expected to launch on wednesday . damian hockney said ex-chatshow host mr kilroy-silk would `` deliver better '' as the leader of a eurosceptic party . he said mr kilroy-silk had made him deputy party leader of veritas , latin for truth . sources close to mr hockney said around eight other members of london ukip were also planning to jump ship . details of the coming week 's events were hammered out at a meeting at mr kilroy-silk 's buckinghamshire home on sunday , the bbc news website was told . the news came after ukip suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed . john houston , 54 , was due to stand in the east kilbride seat in lanarkshire at the next election . a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly . ukip asserts that mr hockney `` has a moral obligation , if not a legal one '' to stand down . mr hockney meanwhile told the bbc : `` i believe that robert kilroy-silk can deliver better as a leader of a eurosceptic party than the current leadership of the uk independence party . '' on the suspension of mr houston , ukip said those who selected him knew nothing of his views . mr houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be `` made available to law-abiding members of the community '' and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade . the document reportedly said : `` we 're looking for the resurrection of the british empire . `` the problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale , and that calls for a radical alliance of the english-speaking nations , which they are uniquely able to do . '' ukip spokesman mark croucher said the main issue would be that mr houston 's reported views had been presented as ukip policy , which they were not .
