india calls for fair trade rules india , which attends the g7 meeting of seven leading industrialised nations on friday , is unlikely to be cowed by its newcomer status . in london on thursday ahead of the meeting , india 's finance minister , lashed out at the restrictive trade policies of the g7 nations . he objected to subsidies on agriculture that make it hard for developing nations like india to compete . he also called for reform of the united nations , the world bank and the imf . palaniappan chidambaram , india 's finance minister , argued that these organisations need to take into account the changing world order , given india and china 's integration into the global economy . he said the issue is not globalisation but `` the terms of engagement in globalisation . '' mr chidambaram is attending the g7 meeting as part of the g20 group of nations , which account for two thirds of the world 's population . at a conference on developing enterprise hosted by uk finance minister gordon brown on friday , he said that he was in favour of floating exchange rates because they help countries cope with economic shocks . `` a flexible exchange rate is one more channel for absorbing both positive and negative shocks , '' he told the conference . india , along with china , brazil , south africa and russia , has been invited to take part in the g7 meeting taking place in london on friday and saturday . china is expected to face renewed pressure to abandon its fixed exchange rate , which g7 nations , in particular the us , have blamed for a surge in cheap chinese exports . `` some countries have tried to use fixed exchange rates . i do not wish to make any judgements , '' mr chidambaram said . separately , the imf warned on thursday that india 's budget deficit was too large and would hamper the country 's economic growth , which it forecast to be around 6.5 % in the year to march 2005 . in the year to march 2004 , the indian economy grew by 8.5 % .
