lennon brands rangers favourites celtic 's neil lennon admits rangers could be considered `` slight favourites '' for the old firm cis cup clash , but insists his side can still win . lennon concedes rangers are in good form at the moment , but they have failed to beat celtic in their last seven meetings . `` rangers are on the up and have been on a good run in recent weeks , '' he said . `` but it 's a game we believe we 're capable of winning if we play our best , '' he told the evening times . `` all the boys are looking forward to it because they are brilliant games to be involved in . `` without playing at the top of our game , we have still been winning matches . `` at the minute , we are at the top of the league and still in with a chance of staying in europe , so i do n't think it is the crisis people have been trying to make out . `` of course , it is a concern when you are losing goals , because we have been notorious for being a team that is hard to beat and keeping clean sheets , but hopefully we are over that wee run . `` considering we lost henrik larsson at the end of last season , we have still been scoring a lot of goals , which is pleasing .
