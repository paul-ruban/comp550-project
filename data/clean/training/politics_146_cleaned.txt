'nuclear dumpsite ' plan attacked plans to allow foreign nuclear waste to be permanently stored in the uk have been branded `` deeply irresponsible '' by the liberal democrats . the government has confirmed intermediate level waste ( ilw ) that was to have been shipped back to its home countries will now be stored in the uk . the cash raised will go towards the uk 's nuclear clean-up programme . but lib dem norman baker accused ministers of turning britain into a `` nuclear dumpsite '' . under current contracts , british nuclear fuels should return all but low level waste , but none has ever been sent back . in future , only highly-radioactive waste will be sent back to its country of origin , normally germany or japan , under armed guard . intermediate waste from countries such as japan , germany , spain , italy , switzerland and sweden will be stored permanently in the uk . at the moment , this waste is stored at sellafield , in cumbria , in the form of glass bricks , untreated liquid waste or solid material in drums . in a statement , the department of trade and industry said the new policy meant there would be a `` sixfold reduction in the number of waste shipments to overseas countries '' . and it said highly-radioactive waste would be returned to its home country sooner , ensuring there would be no overall increase in radioactivity . trade secretary patricia hewitt said the new arrangements , revealed in a commons written statement , would raise up to â£680m for britain 's nuclear clean-up programme , under the new nuclear decommissioning agency . but the move has been criticised by environmental groups and the liberal democrats . mr baker , the lib dem environment spokesman , said : `` i have been warning for months that this would happen and raised it with government several times . but now our worst fears have been confirmed . `` once again britain 's environmental and health needs are being ignored in policies driven by the treasury and dti . `` this is a terrible attempt to offload some of the â£48bn cost of cleaning up nuclear sites . `` the energy act was supposed to help britain clean up , but in order to pay for it we are becoming a nuclear dumpsite . `` the nuclear industry is an economic , social and environmental millstone that hangs around britain 's neck .
