optimism remains over uk housing the uk property market remains robust despite the recent slowdown , according to mortgage lender bradford & bingley and housebuilder george wimpey . b & b said the buy-to-let market - in which the bank is a major player - would continue to grow much faster than the wider mortgage market . the comments came as it reported a 6 % rise in profits to â£280.2m ( $ 532m ) . wimpey reported a 19 % rise in profits to â£450.7m and said recent new home reservations were better than expected . recent housing market surveys have indicated that the uk property market has cooled in recent months after several years of rapid growth . last week , figures from the council of mortgage lenders ( cml ) indicated that the popularity of buy-to-let mortgages - a key phenomenon of the housing boom - could be waning . but b & b - which has a 22 % share of the uk buy-to-let mortgage market - said that while rates of growth were moderating , the sector `` continues to grow at a rate considerably above that of the whole mortgage market '' . overall , b & b said that `` housing market fundamentals remain strong '' . `` interest rates and unemployment are both likely to remain at historically low levels , real household incomes should continue to grow and housing demand is likely to outstrip supply into the medium-term . '' despite the upbeat tone , shares in b & b were down more than 4 % at 325.5p in morning trade as analysts worried over future earnings growth . wimpey 's profit figures came in at the top of expectations , with the numbers helped by buoyant sales in the us offsetting a slight slowdown in the uk . wimpey said the uk housing market had proved `` challenging '' last year . `` by late summer , the market in general had slowed sharply across the country and showed no real improvement during the autumn , '' it added . however , the first seven weeks of this year had produced promising signs , wimpey said . `` visitor levels and interest in this period have been encouraging and reservations have been at the stronger end of our expectations . '' shares in wimpey were up 6 % at 458.5p in morning trade .
