conservative mp defects to labour a conservative mp and former minister has defected to labour . robert jackson , 58 , mp for wantage in oxfordshire , said he was disillusioned with the party 's leadership and its `` dangerous '' views on europe . prime minister tony blair declared himself `` delighted '' , saying mr jackson would be warmly welcomed by labour mps . mr jackson , who has clashed with his leaders over tuition fees and europe in the past , served as higher education minister between 1987 and 1990 . in a letter to his constituency chairman he wrote : `` it is in the country 's best interest that tony blair rather than michael howard should form the next government . '' while saying he admired mr blair 's `` courageous '' leadership of the country , he bitterly criticised the conservatives stance on europe . `` the conservative party 's hostility to europe has now hardened to the point at which it advocates the unilateral denunciation of britain 's treaty obligations , '' he wrote . mr blair said mr jackson was a `` decent , fair-minded and dedicated public servant ... who will be warmly welcome by labour mps and members '' . `` as he rightly says , [ the conservatives ] have learned nothing from their two election defeats and are , if anything , drifting further rightwards , '' he added . a spokesman for michael howard said mr jackson 's views on policy issues were `` very different '' from those of the party leadership . `` he believes students should pay tuition fees , that tony blair should not be criticised over his handling of the iraq war and that more powers should be given to europe , '' the spokesman said . he added that it was not surprising mr jackson had chosen to leave the conservatives . mr jackson is due to stand down at the next election . he is the third conservative mp to defect to labour since 1997 .
