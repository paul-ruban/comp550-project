final hunts held as ban looms hunts in england and wales have begun on the last day that hunting with dogs is legal , with more due out later . thousands of supporters are expected to turn out at more than 250 meets , many of which have altered their normal schedules to be out on a thursday . the ban on hunting with dogs comes into effect from 0001 gmt on friday . the countryside alliance had its latest legal bid to block the ban thwarted on wednesday when the appeal court ruled the hunting act was lawful . but the group says hunting will continue in some form after the ban comes in , with hunts expected to test the new law to its limits . others are expected to defy the ban by continuing to hunt illegally . anti-hunt organisations , for whom the ban is the culmination of years of campaigning , say they hope most will stay within the law . mike hobday , of the league against cruel sports , told bbc news : `` we 've long urged them to go drag hunting - to follow an artificial scent - and that is what we hope they do . `` but if they continue to chase foxes , to chase wild mammals around the countryside , that 's against the law and we 're confident they 'll be brought to justice . '' at the headquarters of quorn hunt in leicestershire , feelings were running high as hunt enthusiasts prepared for their final legal hunt . bbc correspondent sarah mukherjee said hunt supporters were in tears . she said many people did not share the countryside alliance 's optimism that hunting would be able to continue . farmer geoff brooks , a senior member of the quorn hunt , told bbc news people 's lives `` revolved around hunting '' . he described the ban as `` ridiculous '' and `` badly thought out '' but said it would be hard for most people to defy it as they would not want to risk their incomes by getting a criminal record . at the court of appeal on wednesday , the countryside alliance failed in its attempt to have the hunting act ruled invalid . but it says the ban is unenforceable because the law is unclear and impossible to police . the alliance says hunt supporters will go out and test this law to its limits on saturday . the league against cruel sports and the rspca say they will monitor hunts and assist police in bringing prosecutions . the association of chief police officers has issued guidance to forces on how to deal with the new rules . a spokesman said : `` basically , it 's not going to be police officers chasing about in cars across fields , it will be based on intelligence and information received as well . '' the decision on how to police individual hunts will be left to local forces , with more officers sent to hunts where disruption is expected . he said police would consider evidence submitted by anti-hunt organisations on its merits .
