funding cut hits wales students the wales students rugby side has become a casualty of the welsh rugby union 's reorganisation at youth level . an amalgamated under-18 side formed from separate schools and national youth teams plays its first match on thursday , against italy at the gnoll . but that move has seen the wru decide to end its funding of representative sides such as wales students . as a result , traditional international fixtures against england and france in the new year have been cancelled . the welsh students rugby football union feels that it is unable to properly prepare for or stage the matches . the secretary of the welsh students rugby football union , reverend eldon phillips , said : `` it is a shame that fixtures can not be maintained this year . `` the competition provided by the strong english and french teams has enabled the welsh students to test themselves in high quality matches . `` the increasing number of young rugby players entering higher education look for the biggest challenge , that is representative rugby , but this year that opportunity will be denied them . players who have played for wales students before going on to win full senior representative honours include robert jones , rob howley , jon humphreys , darren morris , martyn williams and ceri sweeney .
