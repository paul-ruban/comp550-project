'' yachvili admitted erratic kicking from england 's charlie hodgson and olly barkley , who missed six penalties and a drop goal chance between them , had been decisive . `` i know what it 's like with kicking . when you miss some it 's very hard mentally , but it went well for us , '' he said . france captain fabien pelous insisted his side never doubted they could secure their first win against england at twickenham since 1997 . france were 17-6 down at half-time , but pelous said : `` no-one was down at half-time , we were still confident . `` we said we only had 11 points against us , which was not much . `` the plan was to keep hold of possession and pressure england to losing their composure . '' france coach bernard laporte accepted his side had not played well . `` we know we have to play better to defend the title , '' he said . `` i 'm not happy we did n't score a try but we 're happy because we won .
