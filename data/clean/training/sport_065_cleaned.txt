radcliffe will compete in london paula radcliffe will compete in the flora london marathon this year after deciding her schedule for 2005 . the 31-year-old won the race in 2002 on her marathon debut , defended her title 12 months later and will now seek a third title in the 17 april race . `` it does n't get any better than this for the 25th anniversary , '' said race director david bedford . `` after announcing the greatest men 's field ever we now have the greatest women 's distance runner ever . '' three years ago radcliffe smashed the women 's world record in two hours 18 minutes 15 seconds . the bedford star returned to london 12 months later , lowering her mixed-race world record of 2:17:18 , which she set in chicago in october 2003 , by one minute 53 secs . radcliffe 's career took a setback when she failed to complete the olympic marathon and later dropped out of the athens 10,000m last august . but the 31-year-old bounced back to win the new york marathon in november . radcliffe , however , passed up the chance to go for the `` big city '' marathon grand slam . with wins in chicago , london and new york , only the boston marathon remains to be conquered but that takes place a day after london . `` boston is definitely a race i want to do at some point , but london is very special to me , '' said radcliffe . `` i do n't pick races thinking about things like pressure . i pick the ones in my heart i really want to do . `` i love the atmosphere , crowds and course and know it will always be a great quality race . `` it is also the 25th anniversary this year which adds to the occasion .
