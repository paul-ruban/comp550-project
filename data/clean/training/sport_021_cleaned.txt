chepkemei hit by big ban kenya 's athletics body has suspended two-time london marathon runner-up susan chepkemei from all competition until the end of the year . athletics kenya ( ak ) issued the ban after chepkemei failed to turn up for a cross country training camp in embu . `` we have banned her from all local and international competitions , '' said ak chief isaiah kiplagat . `` we shall communicate this decision to the iaaf and all meet directors all over the world . '' the 29-year-old finished second to paula radcliffe in the 2002 and 2003 london races , and was also edged out in an epic new york marathon contest last year . but the ban will prevent the two-time world half-marathon silver medallist from challenging radcliffe at this year 's london event in april . global sports communications , chepkemei 's management company , said she had wanted to run in the world cross country championships in march . but ak maintained it was making an example of chepkemei as a warning to other kenyan athletes . `` we are taking this action in order to salvage our pride , '' said kiplagat . `` we have been accused of having no teeth to bite with and that agents are ruling over us . '' ka has also threatened three-time women 's short-course champion edith masai with a similar ban if reports that she feigned injury to avoid running at the cross country world championships are true . masai missed the national trials in early february , but was included in the provisional team on the proviso that she ran in a regional competition . she failed to run in the event , citing a leg injury .
