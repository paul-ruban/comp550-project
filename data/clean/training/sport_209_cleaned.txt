gallas sees two-horse race chelsea 's william gallas believes they will battle it out with arsenal for the premiership in the coming months . `` it 'll be a two-horse race all the way to the end of the season because we are both going to give it everything , '' he told bbc sport . `` you need to be good and you need a lot of luck . you need a bit of both but it will be as hard for the arsenal players as it is for the chelsea boys . '' `` we know that we have got the power in our hands just now , '' added gallas . `` but you never know what is going to happen in football - two seasons ago manchester united picked up so many points towards the end of the season when they won the title . `` obviously , nobody at chelsea wants to come second but you never know what happens in football . `` we will be challenging to come first as much as every arsenal player will be challenging to come first . '' gallas has been given extra confidence by the impact manager jose mourinho has had since taking over as manager during the summer . and the french international defender believes mourinho is perfectly suited to boss the squad of chelsea stars and says his managerial expertise will prevent any player revolt . `` it 's only normal when you have got a team put together of such big names that you put the finishing touch to it and the finishing touch at chelsea is a fantastic manager like mourinho , '' he said . `` he is the icing on the cake at the club . he has this fantastic knack of thinking of everything . `` another incredible quality that mourinho has is that every player , even though the fans may consider them to be a stars , within the dressing-room they are absolutely equal . `` mourinho reminds everyone but he does n't have to because he has created a wonderful atmosphere where everybody is playing and laughing every day . `` it is a changed dressing-room from the atmosphere there was last year .
