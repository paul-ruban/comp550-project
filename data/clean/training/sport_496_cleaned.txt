philippoussis doubt over open bid mark philippoussis is almost certain to miss the australian open after suffering a groin injury during the hopman cup loss to the netherlands . the 28-year-old suffered two tears to the adductor muscle and was unable to play in the deciding mixed doubles . he is now unlikely to be fit in time for the australian open which begins on 17 january in melbourne . `` he has to strengthen it enough to cope with repetitive days of tennis , '' said hopman cup doctor hamish osborne . `` it would be very unlikely in my opinion for him to do a five-setter once , let alone two days in a row , inside two weeks . `` the injury is more common in australian rules football , and a fit footballer would normally take three to four weeks to recover fully although mark 's injury is slightly different . '' the australian has suffered a host of injury problems throughout his career but is still holding out slim hope that he can make the event . `` it 's something i 'll have to go by feel . i 'll start treatment as soon as possible and try to strengthen it without tearing it any more , '' he said . `` what does n't kill you makes you stronger . i know i can come back from this and that 's all that matters . - former world number two tommy haas is also a doubt for the australian open after picking up a thigh injury playing for germany in the hopman cup . the 26-year-old had treatment on his left thigh while leading argentine guillermo coria 7-5 2-2 . he played one more game , but his movement was hampered and he quit .
