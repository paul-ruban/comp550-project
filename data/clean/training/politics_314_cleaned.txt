blair to face trust issue head on tony blair says he will be facing the issue of trust and his own integrity head on during the election campaign . during a question and answer session with first-time voters on five news , mr blair said he had no option but to `` confront it '' by talking to people . he also dismissed claims government plans to get 50 % of young people into university would devalue degrees . he was not `` forcing '' anyone to go to university , but places should be there for those who wanted them , he said . in answer to a question from 22-year-old liverpool student david dunne about concerns over the prime minister 's personal integrity , mr blair said talking was the only answer . `` you 've just got to confront it and say to people let 's have a discussion on the things that worry you , the things that make you say ' i ca n't trust you ' or ' i am against you on this . ' '' the `` worst thing in politics '' was that the electorate only got `` little snatches of policy '' from things like prime minister 's questions and the news headlines . this was why he wanted to `` get out of the 30 seconds on the news , '' he added . by talking through policies at least people understood the reason for them , even if they did not agree with them , he said . mr blair also faced questions about british policy on iran and its alleged nuclear weapons programme . he insisted there was no plan for an invasion of the country saying : `` sometimes people say because of what has happened in iraq this is the next place . '' instead there was a real chance of a `` peaceful resolution '' to the problem , he said .
