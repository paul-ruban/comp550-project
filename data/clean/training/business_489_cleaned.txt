criminal probe on citigroup deals traders at us banking giant citigroup are facing a criminal investigation in germany over a controversial bond deal . the deal saw the sale of 11bn euros ( $ 14.4bn ; â£7.6bn ) of government bonds in a few minutes on 2 august , with 4bn euros-worth then bought back later . the move was widely criticised at the time , and now the german regulator has said it has found evidence of possible market manipulation . citigroup said it would continue to co-operate fully with the authorities . `` we are disappointed that the bafin has referred to the prosecutor the question of whether action should be brought against individuals involved , '' citigroup said . if the traders are found guilty , they could face a five-year jail term or a fine , reuters reported bafin as saying . however , under german criminal law , prosecutors can not pursue citigroup itself . germany 's financial watchdog bafin told bbc news it had now transferred the investigation to the public prosecutor . `` i can confirm that bafin has passed through the case to the public prosecutor , '' a bafin spokeswoman said . `` it is now a criminal investigation . '' `` we found clues of possible market manipulation , '' the spokeswoman said , which included signs of linked bond trading ahead of the main trades on 2 august . `` germany 's securities trading act says that if bafin finds such clues , it has to put the case in the hands of the prosecutor . '' regulatory investigations are still going on in france , the uk and elsewhere . some citigroup operations elsewhere in the world came under regulatory criticism in 2004 . its private banking operation in japan was closed down by regulators in tokyo after an `` aggressive sales culture '' led the bank to flout anti-money laundering rules .
