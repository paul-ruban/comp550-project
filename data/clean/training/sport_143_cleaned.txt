wenger handed summer war chest arsenal boss arsene wenger has been guaranteed transfer funds to boost his squad the summer . the club 's managing director , keith edelman , stressed that the development of their new â£350m stadium had no affect on wenger 's spending power . `` the money is there . do n't worry we 've got it , '' edelman told bbc sport . `` hopefully , we 'll spend it this summer and in the coming years . arsene attends all our board meetings and he knows our finances are very strong . '' edelman added that it was pointless having a brand new stadium if the team did not match the surroundings . `` its great to have nice , new surroundings , but if the team are n't performing on the pitch , then there is n't great respect in having a fabulous stadium , '' he said . `` it 's important that we had sufficient funds for our team in place , before we began on the stadium .
