anelka 'eyes man city departure' striker nicolas anelka reportedly wants to leave manchester city in search of champions league football . anelka , 25 , is in talks over a contract extension beyond 2007 with city but is believed to fear his career will go stale if he stays at the club . the news of the world reports that anelka told a french magazine : `` i either decide to win titles or to have an easy life . `` i think i will always choose football , if a great club makes me an offer . '' he added : `` to win titles you need players who have the capability of doing so . if we stagnate between eighth and 15th place it 's impossible to progress . `` if i am going to score goals and not win , there is a risk it is going to create a feeling of being fed up . '' anelka has earned a reputation for being a difficult character to handle after spells at arsenal , real madrid and paris st germain and he feels that is now coming back to haunt him . `` i am in talks to sign an extension to my contract , '' he said . `` i am well here but the sporting aspect also comes into account . `` playing for eighth place is good but i miss the champions league . `` i won it with real madrid in 2000 and i need to be playing in it - and i should be playing in it . `` i 'm not in it because of things that have happened in the past and had nothing to do with football . `` but i do n't blame anyone . it 's a bit my fault .
