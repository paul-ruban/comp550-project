us composer recreates bach score a us musicologist has recreated a lost musical score by german composer johann sebastian bach . the 1728 composition , called wedding cantata bwv 216 , was found among the papers of japanese pianist chieko hara , who died in japan in 2001 aged 86 . the work , written for the wedding of a daughter of a german customs official , was missing for 80 years . joshua rifkin - a composer and leading interpreter of bach - has recreated the missing instrumental parts . he said he originally wanted to let the lost cantata lie in rest . `` maybe a fragment should stay a fragment , '' said rifkin . `` then i thought of palaeontologists , from one bone they figure the entire dinosaur . this is my dinosaur . '' the eight rediscovered pages consist of vocal pieces in german for soprano and alto , with the seven movements lasting for a total of between 20 and 25 minutes . the instrumental parts were entirely lost except for two recycled movements , a duet and an aria which had been used elsewhere in bach 's work . rifkin likened the challenge to a `` musical rubik 's cube '' . `` i could not reconstruct what bach wrote but i could give the people of today an idea of what his music was like , '' he said . `` it sounds like bach 's music , but the listener should not know which part is bach 's and which part is mine .
