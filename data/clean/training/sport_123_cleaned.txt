england 's defensive crisis grows england 's defensive worries have deepened following the withdrawal of tottenham 's ledley king from the squad to face holland . chelsea 's john terry and wayne bridge are also out , leaving coach sven-goran eriksson with a real problem for wednesday 's match at villa park . injured rio ferdinand and sol campbell were both left out of the squad , and matthew upson has already pulled out . wes brown and jamie carragher are likely to be the makeshift partnership . terry , the captain of chelsea as they push for the premiership title , would have been a certain starter in the absence of campbell and ferdinand . but now he has pulled out with a bruised knee and is likely to be replaced by carragher , alongside brown . manchester united 's brown last played for england in the defeat by australia at upton park in february 2003 . the 25-year-old was only called into the squad on sunday night as cover following the enforced withdrawal of upson , who has a hamstring injury . and brown now looks certain to add to his tally of seven senior appearances for england . king was forced to pull out after his groin injury was assessed by england 's medical staff . eriksson has still not decided whether to call up any further back-up , having already summoned phil neville after bridge pulled out with a foot injury .
