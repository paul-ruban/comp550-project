thanou desperate to make return greek sprinter katerina thanou says she is eager to compete again after being cleared of missing a drugs test by an independent greek tribunal . thanou , 30 , was provisionally suspended for missing a test before the olympics , but the decision was overturned . `` the iaaf will decide if we can compete again in greece and abroad , '' thanou told to vima newspaper in her first interview since the athens olympics . `` if given the green light i will run again - that 's the only thing i want . '' thanou , 30 , and her compatriot kostas kenteris were provisionally suspended by the iaaf in december for missing three drugs tests . the third was alleged to have been on the eve of the opening ceremony of the athens olympics . but an independent tribunal of the greek athletics federation overturned the provisional ban on 18 march . the iaaf - which said it was `` very surprised '' by the decision of the greek tribunal - is deciding whether to appeal against the decision at the court of arbitration for sport . however , dick pound , the chairman of the world anti-doping authority , has said he will appeal against the decision if the iaaf does not . and thanou and kenteris face a criminal trial later this year for allegedly avoiding the test and then faking a motorcycle accident . thanou said : `` i can see how people can think the accident seemed like a childish excuse . `` i can not deny that we made a lot of mistakes during that time . i always said we needed a pr person . `` an athlete would have to be very stupid to take illegal substances when he or she knows that they will undergo tests at any given moment . `` i am a champion . i can not risk everything i 've achieved in such a silly way .
