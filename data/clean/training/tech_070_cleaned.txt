telewest to challenge sky plus cable firm telewest is to offer a personal video recorder ( pvr ) in a set -top box to challenge sky plus . sky plus is the market leader in the field of digital video recorders in the uk , with 474,000 subscribers . pvrs record tv programmes to a hard drive , letting viewers pause , and rewind live television and effectively `` time shift '' the viewing experience . a number of pvrs incorporating freeview digital terrestrial tv are also on the market but their success is limited . telewest 's pvr will offer a 160gb hard drive , which has storage for up to 80 hours of programmes . the box has three tuners , which means viewers can record two channels simultaneously while watching a third channel . sky plus boxes come in two versions - a 20gb version for â£99 and a 160gb version for â£399 . sky also charges a â£10 subscription fee to the service , unless viewers have a subscription to one of its premium packages . telewest has yet to reveal pricing for the new box or if it will be charging a subscription fee for the service . eric tveter , president and chief operating officer at telewest broadband , said : `` we will make our pvr set-top box available later this year , putting a stop to missed soaps , interrupted films and arguments over which programmes to record . '' pvrs and recordable dvd players are set to replace video recorders as the standard method of recording and saving favourite tv programmes . last year , high street retailer dixons said it was going to stop selling vhs machines in favour of pvrs and recordable dvd machines . sky has said it aims to have 25 % of its subscribers using sky plus by 2010 - it is predicting 10 million total subscribers by that date . it currently has 7.4 million subscribers , while telewest provides digital cable to 1.7 million customers .
