eurovision 'greats ' to do battle stars of the eurovision song contest from the show 's 50-year history are to compete against each other to celebrate the contest 's anniversary . viewers will choose 14 past songs to be performed by the original artists or others in the spirit of the originals . past eurovision performers include abba , celine dion , bucks fizz , nana mouskouri , lulu and julio iglesias . fans will then vote as usual to pick the all-time best eurovision song during the show in denmark in october . the first contest was organised by the european broadcasting union , or ebu , in 1956 , and has become an annual event pitting pop giants against musical minnows - with often surprising results . while some regard it as an essential celebration of continental talent , others see it as an equally unmissable parade of the reasons some countries do not normally produce international stars . the 50th annual contest will be held in kiev , ukraine , in may , after ukrainian singer ruslana won last year . the 50th anniversary special will be held in denmark later this year because the danish broadcasting corporation came up with the idea for the all-time contest . a plan to hold it in london was scrapped because of problems finding a suitable venue . ireland has been the most successful country in the show 's history with seven victories , followed by the uk , france and luxembourg with five each .
