google to scan famous libraries the libraries of five of the world 's most important academic institutions are to be digitised by google . scanned pages from books in the public domain will then be made available for search and reading online . the full libraries of michigan and stanford universities , as well as archives at harvard , oxford and the new york public library are included . online pages from scanned books will not have adverts but will have links to online store amazon , google said . `` the goal of the project is to unlock the wealth of information that is offline and bring it online , '' said susan wojcicki , director of product management at google . there will also be links to public libraries so that the books can be borrowed . google will not be paid for providing for the links . it will take six years to digitise the full collection at michigan , which contains seven million volumes . users will only have access to extracts and bibliographies of copyrighted works . the new york library is allowing google to include a small portion of books no longer covered by copyright . harvard is limiting its participation to 40,000 books , while oxford wants google to scan books originally published in the 19th century and held in the bodleian library . a spokeswoman for oxford university said the digitised books would include novels , poetry , political tracts and art books . `` important works that are out of print or only available in a few libraries around the world will be made available to everyone , '' she said . about one million books will be scanned by google , less than 15 % of the total collection held in the bodleian . `` we hope that oxford 's contribution to this project will be of scholarly use , as well as general interest , to people around the world , '' said reg carr , director of oxford university library services . `` it 's a significant opportunity to bring our material to the rest of the world , '' said paul leclerc , president of the new york public library . `` it could solve an old problem : if people ca n't get to us , how can we get to them ? '' `` this is the day the world changes , '' said john wilkin , a university of michigan librarian working with google . `` it will be disruptive because some people will worry that this is the beginning of the end of libraries . `` but this is something we have to do to revitalise the profession and make it more meaningful .
