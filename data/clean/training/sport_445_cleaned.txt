angry williams rejects criticism serena williams has angrily rejected claims that she and sister venus are a declining force in tennis . the sisters ended last year without a grand slam title for the first time since 1998 . but serena denied their challenge was fading , saying : `` that 's not fair - i 'm tired of not saying anything . `` we 've been practising hard . we 've had serious injuries . i 've had surgery and after , i got to the wimbledon final . i do n't know many who have done that . '' while serena is through to the australian open semi-finals , venus went out in the fourth round , meaning she has not gone further than the last eight in her last five grand slam appearances . but serena added : `` venus had a severe strain in her stomach . i actually had the same injury , but i did n't tear it the way she did . `` if i would have torn it , i would n't have been here . `` she played a player ( alicia molik ) that just played out of her mind and venus made some errors that she probably should n't have made . '' serena also said people tended to forget the impact the 2003 murder of sister yetunde price had had on the family . `` to top it off , we have a very , very , very , very , very close family '' serena continued . `` to be in some situation that we 've been placed in in the past little over a year , it 's not easy to come out and just perform at your best when you realize there are so many things that are so important . `` so , no , we 're not declining . we 're here . i do n't have to win this tournament to prove anything . i know that i 'm out here and i know that i 'm one of the best players out here .
