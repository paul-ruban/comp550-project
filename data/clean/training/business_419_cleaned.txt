$ 1m payoff for former shell boss shell is to pay $ 1m ( â£522,000 ) to the ex-finance chief who stepped down from her post in april 2004 after the firm over-stated its reserves . judy boynton finally left the firm on 31 december , having spent the intervening time as a special advisor to chief executive jeroen van der veer . in january 2004 , shell told shocked investors that its reserves were 20 % smaller than previously thought . shell said the pay-off was in line with ms boynton 's contract . she was leaving `` by mutual agreement to pursue other career opportunities '' , the firm said in a statement . the severance package means she keeps long-term share options , but fails to collect on a 2003 incentive plan since the firm has failed to meet the targets included in it . the revelation that shell had inflated its reserves led to the resignation of its chairman , sir phil watts , and production chief walter van der vijver . an investigation commissioned by shell found that ms boynton had to share responsibility for the company 's behaviour . despite receiving an email from mr van de vijver which said the firm had `` fooled '' the market about its reserves , the investigation said , she did nothing to inquire further . in all , shell restated its reserves four times during 2003 . in september , it paid â£82.7m in fines to regulators on both sides of the atlantic for violating market rules in its reporting of its reserves .
