tsunami 'wo n't divert africa aid' uk aid to help the victims of the asian tsunami disaster will not take much needed relief from africa , prime minister tony blair has promised . mr blair told the bbc 's breakfast with frost show the money spent on the tsunami would not `` invade '' the money britain wanted to spend on africa . questioned about the disaster , he said his faith in god had not been shaken . he added he would give new figures on the number of tsunami-related british deaths to the commons on monday . foreign secretary jack straw said on friday that about 440 britons were either dead or missing in the disaster . mr blair told sunday 's programme : `` since jack straw gave those figures a couple of days ago they have n't moved a great deal , which should give us some hope that we are beginning to reach the peak of the numbers . but we just ca n't be sure . `` it is just an immensely difficult job to get absolutely accurate figures , all countries are struggling with this . '' he said the â£50 million originally allocated from the department for international development was now `` well on the way '' to being spent . but the exact allocation could not be clarified until the world bank had completed its assessment of the needs of the countries affected . within the next few weeks a clearer picture would emerge of the long-term costs of reconstruction , he added . but he pledged that africa - which sees a `` preventable '' tsunami-size death toll every month from conflict , disease and poverty - would not be neglected . as britain takes up its presidency of the g8 group of leading nations , mr blair said ministers had a big agenda for africa . `` for the first time we have a plan that wo n't just deal with aid and debt but will also deal on issues of governance within african countries and conflict resolution , '' he said . `` a lot of the problems in africa come from conflict , that again are preventable , but only with the right systems in place .
