kirwan demands italy consistency italy coach john kirwan has challenged his side to match the performance they produced in pushing ireland close when they meet wales on saturday . despite losing 28-17 in sunday 's six nations encounter , the italians confirmed their continuing improvement . `` our goal is to match every side we face and against ireland we showed we could do that , '' said kirwan . `` but the most important thing is that we build on that performance when we play wales on saturday . '' italy 's half-backs had a mixed afternoon , with recalled scrum-half alessandro troncon impressing but fly-half luciano orquera having an off-day with the boot . kirwan said : `` i was very happy with troncon . he had an incredible game - he was very good in attack and defence . `` orquera 's kicking was off but he showed great courage in defence . `` he also followed the game plan . we have to give him confidence because he has the capability to do well .
