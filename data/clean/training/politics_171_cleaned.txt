tories pledge free sports lessons children would be offered two hours ' free sports training a week by a future tory government , the party has said . the club2school policy would provide up to â£250m yearly for local sports clubs in the uk to deliver after-school sport . the extra coaching would be funded by the national lottery and would come on top of the two hours of sport a week children are supposed to get in school . shadow home secretary david davis said five million children were being denied adequate sporting opportunities . the plans would help tackle the `` fastest growing rate of obesity in the developed world '' , he said . shadow sports minister lord moynihan said the policy would empower local clubs and create a lasting legacy . `` we aim to shift the emphasis on after-school sport provision away from our overstretched teachers and schools directly in to the 151,000 sports clubs in the uk . '' the tories say labour 's plans to give all children two hours of sports lessons a week in schools have failed . government figures show that in england in 2002 only a third of schools at key stages 1 , 3 and 4 and two-fifths of schools at key stage 2 , met that target . the tories also claim that of the â£750m the prime minister pledged in 2000 to invest on school sports facilities , only â£41m had been spent . but the big lottery fund has said that complex capital projects are involved - and it was confident the money would all be allocated by next year as intended .
