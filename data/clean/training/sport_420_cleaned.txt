o'connor aims to grab opportunity johnny o'connor is determined to make a big impression when he makes his rbs six nations debut for ireland against scotland on saturday . the wasps flanker replaces denis leamy but o'connor knows that the munster man will be pushing hard for a recall for the following game against england . `` it 's a 'horses for courses ' selection really , '' said o'connor . `` there 's a lot of competition here and i ca n't just drag my heels around if i do n't get picked . '' it looks a definite head-to-head battle between himself and 23-year-old leamy - three stone heavier than o'connor - for the number seven role against the world champions . nonetheless , all o'connor is currently concerned about is making an impression while winning his third cap . `` missing the italian game was disappointing certainly , but you ca n't dwell on these things - it 's part and parcel of rugby . `` denis has been playing really well and deserved his opportunity . `` it 's a good situation to be in if there are good players around you , pushing for a place in the side . '' o'connor , who celebrated his 25th birthday on wednesday , was touted by wasps director of rugby warren gatland as a possible 2005 lions test openside as far back as last september . and his reputation as a breakdown scavenger and heavy hitter has seen him come to the forefront of o'sullivan 's mind for the scottish tussle . o'connor added : `` it will be interesting to see how situations on the deck is reffed , with the new laws having come in . `` obviously the breakdown a big part of what i do on the pitch so i 'm hoping to hold some influence there against what is a very solid scottish pack . '' o'connor will be winning his third cap after making his debut in the victory over south africa last november .
