uk young top euro earnings league british children enjoy the highest average annual income in europe - more than double that of spanish or italian youngsters , a report suggests . children in the uk between the ages of 10 and 17 had an annual income of â£775 , said market analyst datamonitor . they use `` pester power '' to get their parents to stump up nearly a third of this income , the report said . as for how they spend their cash , the bulk goes on personal care , soft drinks and food , datamonitor said . datamonitor adds that british teenagers are keen on personal care because it helps them combine two seemingly contradictory emotional needs - the desire to fit in and the desire to express their individuality . british teenage girls , compared to their counterparts in seven european countries , are the most keen to use make-up products . nearly three out of four girls said they used make-up . according to the datamonitor report the trend marked british teenagers out as `` particularly important to cosmetics manufacturers as they are likely to experiment more with brands and products and form long-term beauty routines '' . and the good times are likely to keep rolling for british children , as the report predicts that they will still be topping the earnings table in 2008 .
