howard 'truanted to play snooker' conservative leader michael howard has admitted he used to play truant to spend time with his school friends at a snooker hall . mr howard said his time at jack 's snooker hall in llanelli in the 1950s had not done him `` any lasting damage '' . but he told the times educational supplement that truancy was `` very bad '' and said `` firm action '' was needed . mr howard also called for a return to o-levels and more classroom discipline . mr howard eventually left llanelli grammar school - and the snooker hall - to go to cambridge university . he said : `` i do n't think it 's done me any lasting damage . nor has it made me a snooker world champion . `` there might have been some occasions when we left early of an afternoon . `` i 'm just being honest . i think truancy is a very bad thing and that firm action should be taken to deal with it . '' another player who has failed to win snooker 's world championship - jimmy `` the whirlwind `` white - has previously admitted missing lessons , instead spending his days in smoky halls . `` tony meo [ another player ] and me used to spend all of our spare time there , '' mr white said , `` we loved the game and the atmosphere . `` school went out of the window . i went for a while and then started taking time off . '' mr howard 's fellow welshman ray reardon - known by his fellow professionals as `` dracula '' - won the snooker world championship six times , having left school at 14 to work as a miner . and terry griffiths , like mr howard from llanelli , won the tournament in 1979 . it is not known whether the two of them ever clashed cues at jack 's .
