alfa romeos 'to get gm engines' fiat is to stop making six-cylinder petrol engines for its sporty alfa romeo subsidiary , unions at the italian carmaker have said . the unions claim fiat is to close the fiat powertrain plant at arese near milan and instead source six-cylinder engines from general motors . fiat has yet to comment on the matter , but the unions say the new engines will be made by gm in australia . the news comes a week after gm pulled out of an agreement to buy fiat . gm had to pay former partner fiat 1.55bn euros ( $ 2bn ; â£1.1bn ) to get out of a deal which could have forced it to buy the italian carmaker outright . fiat and gm also ended their five-year alliance and two joint ventures in engines and purchasing , but did agree to continue buying each other 's engines . `` powertrain told us today that alfa romeo engines will no longer be made in arese , '' said union leader vincenzo lilliu , as reported by the reuters news agency . `` the assembly line will be dismantled and the six-cylinder alfa romeo motor will be replaced with an engine gm produces in australia . '' reuters also said that mr lilliu and other union bosses shouted insults at fiat chairman luca di montezemolo , following a meeting on tuesday regarding the future of the arese plant . the unions said the end of engine production at the facility would mean the loss of 800 jobs . all alfa romeo models can be bought with a six-cylinder engine - the 147 , 156 , 156 sportwagon , 166 , gtv , gt and spider .
