retail sales show festive fervour uk retail sales were better than expected in november as christmas shoppers began their seasonal flock to the high street , figures show . the office for national statistics ( ons ) said retail sales rose 0.6 % on the month and 6.1 % on the year . but the figures , along with this week 's inflation report , could trigger another interest rate rise in the new year . however , recent data from the british retail consortium showed a 0.2 % slip in high street sales during november . the ons data confounded analyst expectations . many had expected sales to fall slightly in november as shoppers put off buying christmas presents until december . however , retailers ' attempts to draw in the crowds may be behind november 's unexpected rise in sales , they say . aggressive tactics , such as one-day discount sales adopted by stores such as marks & spencer , appear to have paid off . `` price discounting has certainly accounted for much of this because the value of retail sales has n't grown as much as volumes , '' said investec economist david page . the figures sparked a rally for sterling as the data supported the view that it is too early to assume that base rates have peaked .
