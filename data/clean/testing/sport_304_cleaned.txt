double injury blow strikes wales wales centre sonny parker and number eight ryan jones will miss saturday 's game with italy because of injury . parker has not recovered from a trapped nerve in his neck that kept him out of the win over england , and tom shanklin is expected to continue at centre . jones damaged his collar bone after coming on as a replacement against england and joins flanker colin charvis ( foot injury ) on the sidelines . meanwhile , mike ruddock may make gavin henson his first-choice kicker in rome . the centre was wales ' hero in the 11-9 six nations win over england , landing a huge late penalty from wide out to clinch the game . first-choice kicker stephen jones handed over responsibility because of henson 's greater kicking range , but the fly-half had already missed a number of shots at goal . `` our first aim was to get gavin settled into the team , but giving him the kicks is something we 'll talk about in selection this week , '' wales coach mike ruddock told bbc sport wales . henson himself says he is relishing all the media hype that has been heaped on him since last saturday 's game . `` i thrive on it and think it makes me perform better , '' he said . `` i 'm glad it 's a short week before the italy game . there was so much build-up before england , but we fly out to rome on thursday and we 'll be back playing again .
