blair hails turkey-eu talks deal tony blair has hailed a deal bringing turkey a step closer to eu membership as important for the world 's future `` peace and prosperity '' . mr blair has been a leading advocate of turkish membership despite controversy surrounding the idea . leaving a brussels summit mr blair said `` the fact turkey is a muslim country does not mean it should be barred '' . the deal to open formal talks with ankara came despite an eu demand for turkey to recognise cyprus . it was agreed the issue can be tackled at a later date but turkish premier recep erdogan had to accept negotiations did not guarantee his country full eu membership . if it joins , turkey may have to accept restrictions to limit migration by its citizens . mr blair said having turkey in the eu was of `` importance to the future peace and prosperity of my country , britain , and the wider world '' . `` we are stating a fundamental principle that the fact turkey is a muslim country does not mean it should be barred from europe . `` on the contrary , if it fulfils the same principles of human rights , then muslim and christian can work together . '' under the agreement , turkey must issue a written statement promising to sign an accord effectively recognising the greek cypriot government , but gives turkey more time to sell the idea to its people . the internationally recognised southern part of cyprus is an eu member , but turkey , which occupies northern cyprus , had previously insisted it would not bow to demands to recognise the country , calling the issue a `` red line '' . it could take up to 15 years before turkey is able to join , and entry can not be guaranteed . the eu has also announced that it will start accession talks with croatia in april 2005 . however , talks will begin only if the country co-operates fully with the un war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia .
