virus poses as christmas e-mail security firms are warning about a windows virus disguising itself as an electronic christmas card . the zafi.d virus translates the christmas greeting on its subject line into the language of the person receiving infected e-mail . anti-virus firms speculate that this multilingual ability is helping the malicious program spread widely online . anti-virus firm sophos said that 10 % of the e-mail currently on the net was infected with the zafi virus . like many other windows viruses , zafi-d plunders microsoft outlook for e-mail addresses and then uses mail-sending software to despatch itself across the web to new victims . to be infected users must open up the attachment travelling with the message which bears the code for the malicious bug . the attachment on the e-mail poses as an electronic christmas card but anyone opening it will simply get a crude image of two smiley faces . the virus ' subject line says `` merry christmas '' and translates this into one of 15 languages depending of the final suffix of the e-mail address the infected message has been sent to . the message in the body of the e-mail reads : `` happy holidays '' and this too is translated . on infected machines the virus tries to disable anti-virus and firewall software and opens up a backdoor on the pc to hand over control to the writer of the virus . the virus is thought to have spread most widely in south america , italy , spain , bulgaria and hungary . the original zafi virus appeared in april this year . `` we have seen these hoaxes for several christmases already , and personally i prefer traditional pen and paper cards , and we recommend this to all our clients too , '' said mikko hypponen , who heads f-secure 's anti-virus team .
