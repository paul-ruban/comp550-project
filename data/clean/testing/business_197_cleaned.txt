ukraine steel sell-off 'illegal' the controversial sell-off of a ukrainian steel mill to a relative of the former president was illegal , a court has ruled . the mill , krivorizhstal , was sold in june 2004 for $ 800m ( â£424m ) - well below other offers . president viktor yushchenko , elected in december , is planning to revisit many of ukraine 's recent privatisations . krivorizhstal is one of dozens of firms which he says were sold cheaply to friends of the previous administration . on wednesday , prime minister yulia tymoshenko said as many as 3,000 firms could be included on the list of firms whose sale was being reviewed . mr yushchenko had previously said the list would be limited to 30-40 enterprises . more than 90,000 businesses in all , from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts , have been sold off since 1992 , as the command economy built up when ukraine was part of the soviet union was dismantled . analysts have suggested that the government needs to avoid the impression of an open-ended list , so as to preserve investor confidence . thursday 's ruling by a district court in perchesk overturned a previous decision in a lower court permitting the sale . the consortium which won the auction for the mill was created by viktor pinchuk , son-in-law of former-president leonid kuchma , and rinat akhmetov , the country 's richest man . the next step is for the supreme court to annul the sale altogether , opening the way for krivorizhstal to be resold . mr yushchenko has suggested a fair valuation could be as much as $ 3bn . one of the foreign bidders who lost out , steel giant lnm , told bbc news that it would be interested in any renewed sale .
