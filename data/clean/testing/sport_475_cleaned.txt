agassi fear for melbourne andre agassi 's involvement in the australian open was put in doubt after he pulled out of the kooyong classic with a hip injury . agassi was serving at 5-6 down in the first set to fellow american andy roddick when he decided to bring a premature end to the match . `` my hip was cramping and i just could not continue , '' said the 34-year-old . agassi , who has won the australian open four times , will have an mri scan to discover the extent of the damage . he said the problem was not the same as the hip injury which forced him to miss wimbledon last year . `` the good news is that it did n't just tear , it was tightening up and that can be your body protecting itself , which is hopefully more of the issue , '' he added . `` that was n't comfortable out there at all , what i was feeling . `` i have to wait and see what i 'm dealing with - it 's a pretty scary feeling out there when something does n't feel right and is getting worse . `` it 's very disappointing and i 'll have to do my best to deal with it . time will shortly tell if it ( the australian open ) is a possibility or not . `` i was not counting on this being the end of the day for me . `` maybe in a few days i 'll have a much better sense of what my hopes will be .
