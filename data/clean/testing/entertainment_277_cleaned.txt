the sound of music is coming home the original stage production of the sound of music is to be performed for the first time in the austrian capital , 40 years after the film was released . the first full-scale theatrical production of the musical will make its debut in vienna on saturday . julie andrews starred in the 1965 film version of the rogers and hammerstein classic set in the alpine country . but despite being one of the most successful musicals of all time , it is barely known inside austria . the film was never shown in any cinema in austria and was not broadcast on television until the early 1990s . the musical is based on the true story of the von trapp family who formed a singing troupe and escaped from nazi-occupied austria in 1938 . sensitivities about nazism during wartime austria and issues towards the von trapp family themselves could explain austria 's reluctance to embrace the musical . another source of irritation for austrians is the song edelweiss , which is considered an traditional folk song by many filmgoers . the song was actually an invention by rodgers and hammerstein . many also consider the film to portray a kitsch image of austria , including yodelling , goat-herds and lederhosen . the production is being staged at a viennese opera house , the volksoper , beginning on saturday . maria , the novice nun who falls in love with baron von trapp , will be played by austro-australian actress and singer sandra pires .
