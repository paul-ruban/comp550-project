williams says he will never quit defiant matt williams says he will not quit as scotland coach even if his side slump to a new low with defeat by italy at murrayfield . that would leave the scots as favourites to win the wooden spoon for the second year running . `` i have never quit anything in my life , apart from maybe painting the kitchen , '' he told bbc sport . `` the support we have been given from murrayfield in my whole time here has been 100 % . '' williams has yet to experience an rbs six nations victory after seven attempts and scotland have lost 12 of their 14 games under his leadership . but he rejected the comparison made in some media sources with berti vogts , recently sacked as scotland football manager after a poor run of results . `` how can a german football coach and an australian rugby coach have anything in common ? '' he asked . `` it is a bizarre analogy . it is so absurd that it borders on the humorous . '' williams insists that he is revelling in the pressure , despite the possibility of a second six nations series without a victory . `` that is not beyond the realms of possibility , '' he admitted . `` there 's nothing much between the teams , so we could win the next three games or lose them . `` but i actually really enjoy seeing how you cope with such pressure as a coach . `` it helps the team grow and helps you grow as a coach . `` we could have won in paris but for the last five minutes and now we have two defeats , but we were confident for those two first games and we are confident we can beat italy too .
