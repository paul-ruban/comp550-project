france set for new da vinci novel french booksellers are braced for a rush of interest after another book from the author of the da vinci code is translated into french . angels and demons , by us author dan brown , will go on sale on wednesday . the da vinci code is set in paris - including the louvre - and has sold around one million copies in france . the main character , robert langdon , also appears in angels and demons . the da vinci code is being made into a film starring tom hanks . angels and demons was written before the da vinci code , which has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide , and been translated into more than 40 languages , since it was released in 2003 . angels and demons is set mainly in rome as symbologist robert langdon follows a 400-year-old trail to try to uncover a plot by an ancient brotherhood , the illuminati , to blow up the vatican . the novel deals with moral issues such as the debate between science and religion and also seeks to uncover some of the mysteries surrounding the pope . on his website , brown wrote : `` i think the reason angels and demons is raising eyebrows right now is that it opens some vatican closets most people do n't even know exist . `` but i think most people understand that an organisation as old and powerful as the vatican could not possibly have risen to power without acquiring a few skeletons in their closets . '' such is the success of the da vinci code in france , special tours have been organised to trace langdon 's footsteps , including the the louvre museum and the saint sulpice church . the louvre has also given permission for parts of the film version to be shot in the museum . the film , to be directed by a beautiful mind 's ron howard , is due to start filming at the paris museum in may and stars hanks alongside french actress audrey tautou .
