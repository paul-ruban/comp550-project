'' on the subject of liverpool 's finances , parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium . and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen , he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing , but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan . parry joined liverpool as chief executive in july 1998 from a similar role at the premier league . there have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at anfield - and he had a busy summer , overseeing the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and managing to hold on to steven gerrard . on the subject of liverpool 's captain and prize asset , parry revealed real madrid did ask for an option on the england midfield man during negotiations for striker fernando morientes . he said : `` they were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for fernando morientes , but the response to real madrid was the same - steven is not for sale . '' but when asked if gerrard would be a liverpool player on the first day of next season , parry said : `` i sincerely hope he will be . steven knows my views . he knows rafa 's views . `` we have re-affirmed recently to steven that we are trying to build a team around him . we crave success as much as he does . we know he 's ambitious and nobody can argue with that . `` i think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than he 'd like to do anything else . `` we all want to see progress by next season . he 's not alone in that . there are a lot of other players who feel the same , so we all have a common aim . '' it is expected chelsea will test liverpool with a \u00e2\u00a330m-plus bid in the summer - but parry claims he will be in no mood to listen . `` there have been a lot of open secrets about steven , most of which have been complete myths . it is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer . we did n't had an offer last summer , '' parry explained . `` we had told chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we did n't want to sell him . in reality it did n't go beyond that . `` maybe there will be an offer in the summer . maybe there wo n't . `` our position is we want steven to stay , but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for steven - and he has enough respect for us - to know that it is his decision that will be crucial . `` you are not going to keep a player like steven against his will . that just does n't work , but any idea we are going to accept offers for steven and then tell him 'by the way we 've decided to sell you ' is not on the agenda . you can forget that . '' parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for liverpool 's new stadium in stanley park , which is set to open in 2007 . and he confessed arsenal 's \u00e2\u00a3100m deal with emirates to sponsor their new ground - complete with naming rights - has given the anfield club serious food for thought . he said : `` i have to say historically it is something i have been against , and i have been on record as saying that , but i think the size of the arsenal deal is a real eye-opener . `` i would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just has n't even been worth contemplating . `` but the arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say 'wow - that 's interesting . ' `` my personal point of view is that i would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium . '' some liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial , but parry countered : `` i recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters , but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team . `` if it was the right partner how strong an issue is it ? time will tell . `` i think the stadium will always be anfield , not least because of where it is , but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship ? i think it would be remiss not to . `` that 's not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road , but i think it is clearly something we have to explore . '' on the subject of possible new investment , parry revealed liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor , with rumours of interest from the middle east . that prompted the withdrawal of tycoon steve morgan , who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board . he also accused liverpool of using him as `` a stalking horse '' to attract other bids , but parry explained : `` steve has never been used as a stalking horse . there 's no need , and that is not the way we do business . `` we had discussions with steve over the course of 2004 . i think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it did n't happen . `` quite genuinely , the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the agm in december , and as i have said it was of such potential magnitude , and that potential is so exciting , we felt we had to evaluate it . we are still evaluating it . `` steve 's interest was taken very much on its own merits . his enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold ? `` the door is n't closed on anything . we had a perfectly sensible dialogue with steve last year . `` we have a common interest in making liverpool successful . that 's a dream we all share , so as far as i 'm concerned the door is not closed . '' i would take \u00e2\u00a350m if we had no investment , but if we did , keep him . as for the stadium , if it gets us cash what difference does it make really ? \u00e2\u00a350m for gerrard ? i do n't care who you are , the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be . we can not let that sum of money go , despite gerrard 's quality . through a cleverly worded statement , the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself , which i think is the right thing to do . critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard . ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term . i am hoping he does n't walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash . \u00e2\u00a350m realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad , however , if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it . i would however be happy with gerrard 's transfer for any fee over \u00e2\u00a335m . parry 's statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer can not be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players . upping the ante is another smart move by parry . i would keep gerrard . no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed . the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy . clearly , if he is n't , then we would be foolish not to sell . the worrying thing is who would you buy ( or who would come ) pending possible non-champions league football ."}

'' the legislation will be introduced as part of the health service ( miscellaneous provisions ) bill , which will be considered by parliament before christmas . main points of the plan : - a comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in scotland - the legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers - licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of \u00e2\u00a32,500 - licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence - a system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined - individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of \u00e2\u00a31,000 . mr mcconnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less . he said there had been falling cigarette sales of 13 % in new york and 16 % in ireland . mr mcconnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from new york bars and restaurants and , in ireland , only a one point three per cent volume sales fall , where they were declining before the ban . the afternoon announcement , following a cabinet meeting on wednesday morning , won broad support from opposition parties . the scottish national party 's holyrood leader , nicola sturgeon , welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date . she said : `` the time has come for a ban on smoking in public places . `` there is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70 % of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit . `` but we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations - there are people who are yet to be persuaded . '' the scottish conservative party leader , david mcletchie , questioned what would be exempted from the ban . he was keen to know if inmates in scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke . mr mcletchie asked : `` would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first minister 's brave new scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals ? '' the scottish green party 's health spokeswoman , eleanor scott , said she was pleased scotland would be following the `` success stories of new york and ireland '' . she believed the majority of people in scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke ."}

'' there are 74 different devices that are being sold as hd but are not hd-ready , according to alexander oudendijk , senior vice president of marketing for satellite giant astra . they may be fantastic quality tvs , but many do not have adaptors in them - called dvi or hdmi ( high-definition multimedia interface ) connectors - which let the set handle the higher resolution digital images . part of this is down to lack of understanding and training on the high street , say industry experts , who gathered at bafta in london for the 2nd european hdtv summit last week . `` we have to be careful about consumer confusion . there is a massive education process to go through , '' said mr binks . the industry already recognised that it would be a challenge to get the right information about it across to those of us who will be watching it . eventually , that will be everyone . the bbc is currently developing plans to produce all its tv output to meet hdtv standards by 2010 . preparations for the analogue switch-off are already underway in some areas , and programmes are being filmed with hd cameras . bskyb plans to ship its first generation set-top boxes , to receive hdtv broadcasts , in time for christmas . like its sky+ boxes , they will also be personal video recorders ( pvrs ) . the company will start broadcasts of hdtv programmes , offering them as `` premium channel packages '' , concentrating , to start with , on sports , big events , and films , in early 2006 . but the set-top box which receives hdtv broadcasts has to plug into a display - tv set - that can show the images at the much higher resolution that hd demands , if hdtv is to be `` real '' . by 2010 , 20 % of homes in the uk will have some sort of tv set or display that can show hd in its full glory . but it is all getting rather confusing for people who have only just taken to `` being digital '' . as a result , all the key players , those who make flat panel displays , as well as the satellite companies and broadcasters , formed a hd forum in 2004 to make sure they were all talking to each other . part of the forum has been concerned with issues like industry standards and content protection . but it has also been preoccupied with how to help the paying public know exactly what they are paying for . from next month , all devices that have the right connectors and resolution required will carry a `` hd-ready '' sticker . this also means they are equipped to cope with both analogue and hdtv signals , and so comply with the minimum specification set out by the industry . `` the logo is absolutely the way forward , '' said david mercer , analysts with strategy analytics . `` but it is still not appearing on many retail products . '' the industry is upbeat that the sticker will help , but it is only a start . `` we can only do so much with the position we are in today with manufacturers , '' said mr oudendijk . `` there may well be a number of dissatisfied customers in the next few months . '' the european broadcast union ( ebu ) is testing different flavours of hd formats to prepare for even better hdtv further down the line . it is similarly concerned that people get the right information on hdtv formats , as well as which devices will support the formats . `` we believe consumers buying expensive displays need to ensure their investment is worthwhile , '' said phil laven , technical director for the ebu . the tv display manufacturers want us to watch hd on screens that are at least 42in ( 106cm ) , to get the `` true impact '' of hd , they say , although smaller displays suffice . what may convince people to spend money on hd-ready devices is the falling prices , which continue to tumble across europe . the prices are dropping an average of 20 % every year , according to analysts . lcd prices dropped by 43 % in europe as a whole last year , according to mr oudendijk ."}

'' it added that most of those banned simply tried to use copies of half-life 2 circulating on file-swapping systems such as bit torrent rather than use hacks to get around the need for cd keys . rob fahey , editor of online news site gamesindustry.biz , said the mass banning showed off the power of the steam system . before now , he said , it has been hard for game makers to do anything about piracy once the game was being played . `` but with this , valve is taking really effective steps against people using illegitimate copies of half-life 2 , '' he said . if steam proves effective at cutting the piracy of games to a minimum , said mr fahey , other game makers may be tempted to set up copycat systems . `` it 's not hard to see a point in the near future when every publisher wants you to run an application on your system purely to allow you to play their games , '' he said . this could mean that computers get cluttered with poorly written steam-type systems that are used to batter people with adverts . unless game firms were careful , he said , they could face a backlash from consumers who soon get tired of maintaining different accounts for every game they play ."}

'' dr tamimi said the main issues muslims should consider were what he referred to as the war on iraq , the palestinian situation , the erosion of civil liberties for muslims in the uk and economic , social and education problems . approximately 1.1m of the uk 's 1.6m muslims are of voting age . previous election research has shown the overwhelming majority have traditionally voted labour , but more recent studies have suggested labour support has been falling away significantly among some muslim voters . anger over the war in iraq has appeared to be the main reason , with many saying it was `` unjustified '' . representatives from a number of muslim organisations will attend tuesday 's event . among them will be the muslim council of britain ( mcb ) . the chairman of the mcb 's public affairs committee , sher khan , said the war in iraq would be a `` significant factor '' affecting muslims ' voting intentions . `` i think it 's going to be quite significant because of the number of seats in which they could have an impact , '' mr khan said . however , professor john curtice , of the university of strathclyde , is sceptical about how much difference tactical voting by muslims could make . `` for the most part the labour constituencies where there 's a large muslim community are relatively safe , but there are one or two that are not quite so safe , '' professor curtice said . the constituencies where labour was most at risk from a muslim tactical vote were bethnal green , in east london , and rochdale in lancashire , he added . in bethnal green , former labour mp george galloway , who founded the anti-war party respect , is standing against sitting mp oona king , who had a 10,000-vote majority in 2001 . in rochdale , the liberal democrats - the mainstream party a 2004 icm survey showed was benefiting most from muslim disaffection with labour - secured second place in the 2001 election , securing just under 6,000 votes fewer than labour 's lorna fitzsimons . but professor curtice said the muslim anti-war vote could be split between the liberal democrats and respect , meaning neither would benefit much at the ballot box . `` ironically the tories might be the beneficiaries if labour does lose seats , which is generally the case , '' he said . but dr tamimi said mab 's intention was not to `` empower '' the tories . `` we know the next government will be labour , but we are aiming to send a message that it will make a difference if the muslims use their vote properly . `` if the next labour government has a reduced majority that 's a great achievement because having a very big majority has been very harmful for politics in this country , '' dr tamimi said ."}

'' once the courts decided that the vcr in itself was not an illegal technology , the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business . in august 2004 , the san francisco-based us court of appeals ruled in favour of grokster and streamcast , two file-sharing networks . the court said they were essentially in the same position that sony was in the 1980s vcr battle , and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal . p2p networks usually do not rely on dedicated servers for the transfer of files . instead it uses direct connections between computers - or clients . there are now many different types of p2p systems than work in different ways . p2p nets can be used to share any kind of file , like photos , free software , licensed music and any other digital content . the bbc has already decided to embrace the technology . it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use p2p technology to distribute them . the files would be locked seven days after a programme aired making rights management easier to control . but the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many . the global entertainment industry says more than 2.6 billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month , and about half a million films are downloaded a day . legal music download services , like apple itunes , napster , have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file-sharers away from free content . sales of legally-downloaded songs grew tenfold in 2004 , with 200 million tracks bought online in the us and europe in 12 months , the ifpi reported this week . but such download services are very different from p2p networks , not least because of the financial aspect . there are several money-spinning models that could turn p2p into a golden egg for commercial entertainment companies . paid-for-pass-along , in which firms receive money each time a file is shared , along with various drm solutions and advertiser-based options are all being considered . `` we see there are going to be different models for commoditising p2p , '' said marc morgenstern , vice president of anti-piracy firm overpeer . `` consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together , '' agreed mr morgenstern . but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry 's potential controlling grip on content and p2p technology by continuing to use it for their own creations . unsigned bands , for example , use p2p networks to distribute their music effectively , which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign . `` increasingly , what you are seeing on p2p is consumer-created content , '' said derek broes , from microsoft . `` they will probably pay an increasing role in helping p2p spread , '' he said . looking into p2p 's future , file sharing is just the beginning for p2p networks , as far as mr broes is concerned . `` once some of these issues are resolved , you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content , but also in ways that are unimaginable now , '' he said . `` file-sharing is the tip of the iceberg .

'' he added : `` graphically it was superior to everything else out there . `` it also had a depth to it that made it stand out . '' halo was unusually immersive , sucking the player into the action and blurring the interface between screen and controller . it also capitalised on the growing popularity of lan gaming in the pc world - for the first time it became easy to link multiple game consoles together , allowing up to 16 players to battle against each other at the same time . the game instantly cultivated an online following , which continues today with a score of halo fan websites following every aspect of the sequel , halo 2 . errera spends three to fours hours a day of his own time maintaining the hugely popular website , which attracts 600,000 page views a day from halo fans eager for the latest news . when the xbox launched on november 15 2001 in the us , halo was one of the launch titles and had an immediate impact on critics and consumers . `` halo is the most important launch game for any console ever , '' wrote the influential edge magazine in its review , giving it a rare 10 out of 10 mark . the game had its critics and while it is not a one-off original as a game , it brought many original touches and flourishes to the genre which have defined all other first person shooters since . `` the first time i played it i just stood there watching the spent shells fall out of my gun , '' said errera , remarking on the level of detail in the game . the game also inspired thousands of people to write their own fiction based on the storyline and produce downloadable video clips of the many weird and wonderful things that can be done in the game . `` it blew me away the first time someone managed to climb to the top of halo , '' said errera , referring to a fan who had created a video of master chief scaling the landscape of the graphical world . video clips of the more outrageous stunts that are possible thanks to the game 's amazing physics engine are incredibly popular and some have attained a cult following . speculation about the sequel has seen every titbit analysed and poured over with all the intent of a forensic scientist examining a body . when early screenshots of the game were released some people wrote essay-length articles highlighting everything from the texture of graphics to clues about the story line . errera said expectations of the sequel among fans were sky high . `` it does not feel like a game release any more . somebody told me this was the biggest single release of any product in microsoft 's history . `` we 're all just hoping that bungie has got it right again .

'' he warned musicians against being allied to a particular party , however . `` i do n't know if having tea with politicians is always a good idea . '' kapranos and his glasgow four-piece band have been nominated for five prizes at next week 's brit awards , including best group and best album . their self-titled debut album won last year 's mercury music prize and spawned three top 20 singles . he told the 300-strong audience at the university 's reid hall that musicians should listen to a wide range of music and should not be restricted by stereotypes . `` we say ' i like this ' . because i listen to nirvana and korn i am a troubled individual , i 'm riddled with angst because i listen to chopin and debussy , i listen to kylie minogue and scissor sisters because i 'm upbeat and i like to party , i listen to wagner because i like the smell of napalm in the morning . '' kapranos said there was a general `` hostility '' towards classical music , adding : `` there is very little done to break that hostility other than classic fm . '' he concluded : `` we define ourselves as a nation by the way we encourage our creativity . '' fellow speaker and classical composer james macmillan agreed : `` we need to rediscover our ability to listen . '' previous speakers at the edinburgh lectures series have included former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and author professor stephen hawking . kapranos described his appearance on wednesday as `` more daunting by a long way '' than their upcoming brits performance . `` i do n't really care about the brits , '' he said . `` it 's going to be great to go down but i have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonight . '' i think the government should do more to help up-and-coming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues . also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels . rather than expecting the government - i.e . the taxpayer - to fork out , why do n't some of the megastars put something back in ? some of britain 's wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums , concerts etc . there are far more important demands on government funds . if they can fund football , why not fund music ? areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants , so why not music ? we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music . the only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash . the government has enough problems funding schools and health services . if alex kapranos genuinely thinks a multi-billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that . as a scot living in england , i appreciate the value of scottish music and culture being a success , so i can see no problem with it ! franz ferdinand , travis and snow patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world , so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goods ! i think the issue is more fundamental : should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi-million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state ? the answer is most definitely no . those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque should n't be looking for government subsidies . i know that if i was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping i would want to finance myself until i was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship . yes the government should fund music - it brings joy to the masses . there are already thousands of state-funded musicians out there sitting around , twiddling their thumbs on the `` new deal '' . getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use . as long as the government was funding real talent it would be a great move . i would hate to see more pop idol-type funding of music though , as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that alex talked about . only if the proposals make financial sense . franz ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales - if they 'd had a government grant to get started they 'd have more than paid it back by now , so the treasury would be making far more than it paid out . however , the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they 're a musician . the government should n't `` fund '' music - it should `` invest '' in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment . i think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise . the equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people . however , i do feel this should be the extent of their role , to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there . i do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies ! they generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately , the directors are in the business for ! if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government would n't have to fork out a great deal . yeah , why not ? music should be government funded , particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands/artists and stuff . pop music pretty much rules the earth , so more attention should go to the other fraternities i agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but i am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer . there is a great deal of money generated through pop music - perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy . perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idol-style music - that is , the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers . call it a tax on music `` pollution '' , if you like . though i really like franz ferdinand , i have to disagree with mr kapranos . once government gets their hand into the private sector , it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues . many years ago , this was the case with the us nea , when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting . the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privately-funded organizations , like save the music in the us ."}
{"id": 132, "label": 2, "text": "minimum wage increased to \u00e2\u00a35.05 the minimum wage will rise in october , benefiting more than 1m people , the government has announced . adults must be paid at least \u00e2\u00a35.05 an hour , up from \u00e2\u00a34.85 , while 18 to 21 year olds will be paid \u00e2\u00a34.25 . the recommendations came from the low pay commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in 1999 . businesses wanted it frozen , warning more rises could damage competitiveness but the unions want a \u00e2\u00a36 rate . a further increase in the adult rate to \u00e2\u00a35.35 an hour is provisionally scheduled for october 2006 . according to the commission , many businesses had found the last two significant increases in the minimum wage `` challenging '' . `` we have therefore recommended only a slight increase above average earnings , and concentrated it in the second year to allow business more time to absorb the impact , '' said chairman adair turner . the government says most of those on the minimum wage are women - with many working in cleaning , catering , shops and hairdressing . unveiling the latest increase , mr blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become a `` symbol of decency and fairness '' . `` for too long , poverty pay capped the aspiration and prosperity of far too many hard-working families , '' he said . `` too often , people were told to make a choice between the indignity of unemployment or the humiliation of poverty pay . '' chancellor gordon brown and transport secretary alistair darling promoted the news in edinburgh , wales secretary peter hain and welsh first minister rhodri morgan in cardiff and northern ireland minister john spellar in belfast . the government has not accepted the commission 's recommendation that 21-year-olds should be paid at the adult rate , but says it will look again at the rate later on . mr brown said : `` we want to do nothing that can damage the employment opportunities for young people , particularly young people entering the labour market for the first time . '' the government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wage . the national minimum wage is currently set at \u00e2\u00a34.85 per hour for those aged 22 and above , and at \u00e2\u00a34.10 for those aged 18 to 21 . a \u00e2\u00a33 per hour minimum wage was introduced last october for 16 to 17-year-olds , but apprentices are exempt . the trade unions congress welcomed the increase , but has called for a \u00e2\u00a36 minimum wage by next year . but the confederation of british industry ( cbi ) called for a `` pause year '' to assess the impact of the above inflation rise in the minimum wage in october . and david frost , director of the british chambers of commerce , said : `` the level of increase each year has increased by rates far outstripping the rates of inflation . `` what employers are saying to us now is that it 's at a level where it 's starting to bite into the competitiveness of companies right across the country . '' the liberal democrats ' economics spokesman vincent cable said he supported the move to raise the minimum wage . `` it 's not just good for the workers themselves but it lifts them out of benefits and therefore is good for the exchequer too , '' he said . conservative leader michael howard said he accepted the principle of the minimum wage and would not `` seek to disturb '' the increase . speaking on bbc radio 4 's woman 's hour , mr howard hinted the tories might go into the general election with a promise to cancel income tax for the lowest-paid workers . `` there are people on very low salaries , very low incomes indeed who really should n't be paying income tax , '' he said . it would be better to decrease taxes on earnings below \u00e2\u00a312,000 a year , with say no tax on below \u00e2\u00a36,000 . the losses in tax can be recouped by having a 50pc tax band for people making over \u00e2\u00a3100,000 . our minimum wage is going to be effectively almost twice the us minimum wage , yet our economy per person is only 2/3rds of the us ! perhaps , we have to really starting questioning why some products cost 50-60 % more here than they do in the us . this combined with the tax decreases would make the pounds the low-paid people do make go much further . it 's still not good enough ! i got a part time job at 16 when i was doing my a-levels in an attempt to get a little money saved for uni . this was only 2 years ago and i was getting paid \u00e2\u00a32.75 an hour , and working as hard as any of the older staff , maybe it 's about time 16 - 21 year olds got a fair wage ! we must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad . still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it . an easy way for the government to do as it preaches would be to insist on floor pay levels for all government workers and take tens of thousand of civil servants out of the social security system all together . any increase is certainly welcome news . however for all those whining about the pressures of an increase in the minimum wage i would simply ask them : `` would you be happy to work for less than \u00e2\u00a35.05 an hour ? '' . thought not ... so then , do n't expect others to either . i ca n't believe that so many of these comments are against the minimum wage ! also i personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you ? it 's about time that these hardworking people are rewarded with only what they deserve and have earned fair pay and a bit of respect would n't go a miss either . br / & gt ; this is good news . the minimum wage has put a sense of equality back into a worker 's relationship with their employer . wages are supposed to be a fair reflection of an employee 's efforts . for too long wages were a point of exploitation - what could an employer get away with . in very simplistic terms this put a pressure to keep low-paid wages low . with the minimum wage this downward pressure is at least partly removed . it is also interesting to read the comments from so called business leaders . they are the first to defend the rights and privileges of boards to award fat-cat salaries , bonuses and pension rights to the select few but they are the first to attack policies that are put in place to merely defend the rights of those that really make those fat cats purr ! i feel there are both negatives and positives to the increase , on one hand some businesses will struggle to stay afloat but on the other hand in today world many young people ca n't afford to move out as property costs too much and only by earning more will they be able to get on in life . its true many may get complacent but the minimum wage could be looked at as more of a stepping stone rather than a hand out . here come the usual whines about how difficult it will be for businesses ! we all remember michael howard 's protestations that the minimum wage would cost a million jobs when it was introduced - funny how he 's gone quiet on that one ! jobs have continued to increase since this humane legislation was brought in . i think if any job is worth doing then it 's worth being paid a fair wage for , and \u00e2\u00a35.05 is hardly a fortune . if your business can not pay its workers a decent wage then maybe it 's not being run properly and if it folds , a better-run company will take over its duties and employ more people , so everybody wins except incompetent business owners ! great keep at it tony , i remember the despair of the 80s and the low wages employers got away with . at last we can make a difference to people and reward them for working . we ca n't afford not to pay a decent wage . it 's not a jobs at any price economy , goodbye sweatshops hello decency . the increase in minimum wage is a good thing . living in the southwest where house prices and rent have increased hugely ( like the rest of the country ) over the past 5 years has made living for you average 18-21 years old very difficult . in the south west the increase in living costs have not been matched by an increase in pay , for example a job i did in plymouth was underpaid to an equivalent worker in exeter by 75p an hour . hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level , and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard , but might never earn a 6 figure salary the chance to branch out on our own . i work at a large hospital where the contractors providing all ancillary services - domestic , catering & portering etc - pay the minimum wage of \u00e2\u00a34.85 as the basic rate . someone has to do these unglamorous jobs and earn enough to live decently . how dare people suggest we are lazy or complacent for accepting these jobs and these wages ? who do they think will be carrying out these public service jobs if contractors are allowed to pay as little as their consciences allow ? this is definitely the right step in the right direction . it shows that this government cares for the low income earners as well . this is a million votes more . good strategy is n't it ? although i would not deny people the minimum wage increase , its timing stinks . i am quite prepared for a raft of 'bribes ' to come from the government before the election and a raft of taxes afterwards , they are playing us for the fools they think we are . this is extremely bad news for any business - whether they are small and medium enterprises or even large companies . by increasing overheads , for business , there will be an almost certain rise in costs to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage are the same people who still want to buy that shirt , or that pair of trainers for next to nothing . the extra cost this increase will bring , will only be reflected in the price of the goods we buy , which , in turn will only serve to discourage companies from setting-up business in the uk , or encourage those companies already based here to look elsewhere . the jubilation felt by `` low-paid '' workers here will soon give way to misery as they lose their jobs . this will only lead to a reduction in jobs . why have many of the call centre jobs gone to india . blair say 's the economy is `` strong and stable economy '' however consumer debt and the country 's debt is at its highest and now they heap this onto businesses , that will have no choice but to cut the workforce . the timing can not be coincidental . this is blatant electioneering and should be exposed as such . andrew in derby complains that raising the minimum wage is 'blatant electioneering ' . i do n't mind if it is . in our degraded democracy , elections are the one time when elites really have to worry about doing something concrete for the majority . my only complaint is the paltry figures being discussed . if my maths is right , a 35 hour week at \u00e2\u00a35.05 gives you an annual income just over \u00e2\u00a39,000 and raising it to \u00e2\u00a36 leaves it under \u00e2\u00a311,000 . the unions should be putting the government under pressure for much more . businesses complaining might like to take a look at corporate pay , shareholder payouts and profits before wondering if paying a living wage is really a controlling factor in the viability of their firm . i am all for lifting the minimum wage of workers to a reasonable level , but we have to accept that with this will come competition from overseas workers . also small businesses will have to be able to afford this manpower cost . we are already seeing a sweeping change in it work being lost to india where people are paid much less . it is difficult for me to understand that only five years ago cheap labour abroad was classified as 'sweat shop ' , but now we are told it is global competition . with our manufacturing industry in serious decline the country can not be entirely service industries without something tangible to serve . there has to be something at the top of the food chain and that is manufacturing . the whole picture needs to be looked at . this is great news , but that might be because i work for minimum wage . seems a good idea and will hopefully be an incentive to those who live to claim to actually get a job . when you can `` earn '' more from claiming than you can from work , there is no incentive . perhaps a step in the right direction . if the tuc get their way a very large number of smes will have to close - this will put more people out of work . how then will the government fudge the unemployment figures ! the government know it is not big business that keeps the economy going but the smes but we always get overlooked , they will only take notice if these large corporations close and move to other countries , after all they are predominantly owned by foreign companies . we are a specialist company but with these increases have already had an effect on us and we have lost work another one will close us . while i 'm delighted for those on low pay that this increase is being put forward , i am extremely concerned at the implications for small businesses . as an employee for a small nursery , i know this increase will cause great hardship for my employer , who has been unable to increase salaries for higher paid employees because of last october 's increase for the lower paid employees - who were originally being paid slightly above the minimum but are now on the minimum . this latest increase of 20p an hour will cause even more financial hardship . if the rate rises to \u00e2\u00a36 then i can foresee many small businesses having to pay off employees . the increase in minimum wage will have a serious effect on my business . although we pay above the minimum level we will have to increase our pay rates to maintain the differential . the raise is well above inflation and without significant increases in sales , it will mean that i will not be taking on a new member of staff as planned and i will be looking to reduce the total hours worked by the other members of staff , overtime being the first to go . i currently employ 42 staff whose wages mirror the national minimum wage . increases above inflation are fine but all of my business is conducted with local authorities who will not accept above inflation rises in my service delivery . 80 % of my costs are labour . the other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase , thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses it is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage - this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the `` lower status '' jobs . i know about this great idea - do n't bother getting qualifications , laze about at school , no need to do anything other than attend so your parents do n't get fined because remember , when you do eventually start working , does n't matter how lazy you are , you 'll be guaranteed a decent wage . the ones who suffer are the employers . i hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that mr blair and mr brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury wo n't take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping , or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door ? i do n't believe in the minimum wage at all ! i think jobs should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wages they should earn them . now , before everyone thinks that i am some `` rich-kid '' , i can assure you i am not . i came from a very much working class background and started work 20 years ago on a youth opportunity program earning \u00e2\u00a325 per week . i worked hard , went to college part time , got my a-levels and degree & bettered myself . i now earn a 6 figure salary . i did that through hard work and getting off my backside . a minimum wage just makes people complacent . to ashley , of swindon : when you earned \u00e2\u00a325 per week , it was worth something . these days that \u00e2\u00a325 would need to be near to \u00e2\u00a360 to have the equivalent buying power . i might add , that thanks to successive governments holding down the tax allowance threshold below inflation , people earning the minimum wage are paying taxes that they never would have done 10 years ago at equivalent wages . `` in my day '' type arguments are a view that belong in the 'your day ' - 20 years ago ! as a graduate working for minimum wage , i welcome any increase of pay i can get . i disagree with ashley , swindon saying i have to work harder to get more pay . i have my gcse 's a-levels and a degree and have chosen to work for a small business that ca n't afford the wages i should be getting , i should be on at least 3x what i 'm getting but they ca n't afford it . we all work hard but the money is just not there . but on the plus side i love my job and would n't change it just to get more pay . as an employer of staff in several shops the last rise in the minimum wage cost my company an additional \u00e2\u00a35000 per year . these next rises will cost me more . i have to get the money from somewhere so pass it on to customers . so no one really wins in the end . in answer to emma from sleaford regarding no one really wins in the end ... on the contrary mr blair wins - he wins because he obviously has announced this to be a vote winner and his treasury wins because as an employer you will know that the amount of tax and national insurance that the government will receive from all the minimum wage increases will rise and of course not only will be paying out higher wages but as an employer higher employer ni contributions as well . if the minimum wage increases again and if it hits anywhere near the \u00e2\u00a36.00 mark there will be 12 more people on the employment line and one more small business going bankrupt - namely mine . think of us employers as well mr blair , we are not all big corporations earning millions . all workers should be entitled to a fair day 's pay for a fair day 's work . how many people on the minimum wage have any hope of obtaining a mortgage or saving towards retirement ? it is good news for many asians living in uk . students who do odd jobs can increase their income and can help there family in their home country . i thank mr. blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wage ."}

'' on tuesday , he told the bbc news website he did not think the comments were offensive and worked happily with meps of different nationalities in the european parliament . he argued that peace was the only reason for having the `` outdated '' eu as there was no economic justification . pointing to germany 's trade interests as a country in the centre of europe , mr nattrass said : `` the fact is that the eu benefits germany but it does not benefit britain . `` i 'm not at all german-bashing . it 's the truth .

'' millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like los caballeros de plan g accessible to fans globally . mainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music , and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible . so , millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com . the name says it all : it is web-based radio , devoted to the hottest spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks . the site , which is in both in english and spanish , is meant to be easy to navigate . all the user has to do is download a media player . there are no djs . it is just music streamed over the net for free . suddenly , with the help of the website , los caballeros de plan g are producing `` export quality '' rap . the web might be just the right medium for spanish language hip-hop right now . the genre is in what millan calls its `` infant stage '' . but the production values are improving , and artists such as argentina 's mustafa yoda are pushing to make it better and better . mustafa yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com . `` he 's considered the eminem of argentina , and the latin american hip-hop scene , '' millan says . `` he really has n't had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world , but he 's definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the spanish-speaking world . '' currently , the chilean group makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com 's top 10 , as is cuban artist papo record . `` every country 's got it 's own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs , '' millan says . latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now . the site has listeners from across the spanish speaking world . right now , mexico leads the way , accounting for about 50 % of listeners . but web surfers in spain are logging in as well - about 25 % of the web station 's traffic comes from there . that is not surprising as many consider spain to be the leader in spanish-language rap and hip-hop . millan says that spain is actually just behind the united states and france in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production . that might be changing , though , as more and more latin american artists are finding audiences . but one spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com 's top 10 . his name is tote king and manuel millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in spain . on his track uno contra veinte emcees , or one against 20 emcees , tote king shows he is well aware of that fact . `` it 's basically him bragging that he 's one of the best emcees in spain right now , '' millan says . `` and it 's pretty much true . he has the tightest productions , and his rap flow is impeccable , it 's amazing . '' latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year . millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of spanish language hip-hop and rap . clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world , a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production ."}

or indeed time - is on the screen . the player sees things through the eyes of gordon freeman , the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original 1998 half-life . having survived that skirmish in an desolate monster-infested research facility , he 's back in another foreboding troublespot - the enigmatic city 17 . it has the look of a beautiful eastern european city , but as soon as your train pulls in to the station , it 's clear that all is not well here . sinister police patrol the unkempt streets , and the oppressive atmosphere clobbers you like a sledgehammer . a casual smattering of the nightmarish creatures from the first game makes this an even less pleasant place to be . you are herded around like a prisoner and have to mingle with a few freedom-fighting civilians to gather information and progress in your task . it is not immediately explained what your objectives are , nor precisely why everything is so ravaged . finding out step-by-step is all part of the experience , although you never fully get to understand what it was all about . that does not really matter . hl2 does not waste energy blinding you with plot . underplaying the narrative in this way is gloriously effective , and immerses the player in the most vivid , convincing and impressive virtual world they are likely to have seen . there are no cut-scenes to interrupt the flow . exposition is accomplished by other characters stopping to talk directly to you . whereas the highly impressive doom iii felt like a top-notch theme park thrill-ride , wandering through half-life 's world truly does feel like being part of a movie . considering its sophistication , the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications . but if ever there was an incentive to upgrade your pc 's components , this is it . on our test machine - an alienware system with an athlon 3500+ processor and ati 's radeon x800 video card - everything ran at full quality without trouble , and the visual experience was simply jaw-dropping . it is not simply that the surfaces , textures and light effects push the technical envelope without mercy , but that such care and artistic flair has gone into designing them . the haunting , grim landscapes become strangely beautiful . luckily you get time to pause mid-task and marvel at the awesome graphical flourishes of your surroundings . so impressive are the physics that you 'll find yourself hurling bits of rubbish around and prodding floating corpses just to marvel at the lifelike way they move . there are puzzles to be solved along the way , pitched at about the right difficulty , but most progress is achieved by force . freeman is quickly reunited with the original game 's famous crowbar , and an array of more sophisticated weapons soon follow . virtually anything not nailed to the floor can be interacted with , and in realistic fashion . you will be wowed by the attention-to-detail as you chip bits of plaster off walls , chase a pigeon out of your way , or dodge exploding barrels as they ping around at deadly speed . at times half-life 2 feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to , and in a curious way , its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome . running around on foot is great enough , but jumping into vehicles proves even more fun . human foes are rendered just as well as alien ones . the stealth sections are as exhilarating as the open gun battles . in gameplay terms , hl2 somehow gets almost everything perfect . and without resorting to the zombies-leaping-out-of-shadows approach of doom iii , it 's all incredibly unsettling . the vacant environment is distinctly eerie , and at one point i even caught myself hesitating to go down a murky tunnel for fear of what might be inside . the game does have a couple of problems . firstly , the carefully-scripted way that you progress through each level might irk some people . a lot of things are meticulously choreographed to happen on cue , which makes for exciting moments , but may be an annoyance to some players and limit the appeal of playing again once you 've completed it . if you like things open-ended and free-ranging , far cry will be a lot more pleasing . but the real downside is the hassle of getting the game to run . installing it proved a life-draining siege that would test a saint 's patience . developer valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy . the box does warn you of this anti-piracy measure , but does not say just how many components have to be downloaded . the time spent doing this will depend on your connection speed , the temperamental valve servers and the time of day , but it can take hours . it would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances - but luckily , half-life 2 is up to the challenge . it is surely the best thing in its genre , and possibly , many will feel , of any genre . the bar has been raised , and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future . half-life 2 is out now for the pc"}

'' mr tansley had to argue his case to be allowed to continue competing with motorcycle racing 's governing body , the autocycle union . `` at that time they would n't let any amputee race at all , but eventually they told me i could have a licence as long as i raced sidecars . '' mr tansley 's invention , the pro-shift , is designed to work with hewland gearboxes which are widely used in motorcycle racing . in addition to helping disabled riders to compete , mr tansley reckons that the pro-shift saves at least 20 seconds per lap when he competes in the isle of man tt . as a result , there has been considerable interest in the product from other riders keen to improve their performance . `` i 'm not prejudiced , i 'll sell to able-bodied people if i have to ! '' he joked . another exhibit on the motorsport endeavour stand is a subaru impreza rally car , adapted to accommodate a variety of disabilities . the vehicle belongs to pararallying , the world 's only rally school for disabled drivers which is based in lincolnshire . `` we use the latest technology supplied by an italian company , '' said rally driver dave hawkins who runs the company . `` the cars have electronic throttles , electronic brakes , electronic clutches - we 've yet to turn anybody away . '' mr hawkins - a paraplegic himself - says his customers have included right or left arm amputees , quadriplegics , people who have had strokes and a woman who had had all four limbs amputated . pararallying uses a vauxhall astra gsi with an automatic gearbox and manual subaru imprezas . the car on display is fitted with a 'duck clutch ' - a switch on the gear stick used instead of the clutch pedal . it also has a second ring behind the steering wheel to operate the throttle and a hand operated brake bar . when joy rainey started competing in motorsport in 1974 she was continuing the family tradition - her father , murray , is a former australian formula 3 champion . and it was rainey senior who modified a sports racer to accommodate his daughter 's small stature so that she could take part in hill climbs . she uses an ordinary road car by putting extensions on the pedals , a cushion behind her back and raising the seat . `` but in a competition car you have to have everything right or you 'll lose the balance of the car , '' she said . `` i bring everything back to me - steering wheel , steering column , gear lever and pedals .

'' us officials have also said that other economies need to grow , so the us is not the main global growth engine . economists say that the fundamentals , or key indicators , of the us economy are looking far from rosy . domestic consumer demand is cooling , and heavy spending by president bush has pushed the budget deficit to a record $ 427bn ( \u00e2\u00a3230bn ) . the current account deficit , meanwhile , hit a record $ 166bn in the second quarter of 2004 . for many analysts , a weaker dollar is here to stay . `` no end is in sight , '' said carsten fritsch , a strategist at commerzbank . `` it is only a matter of time until the euro reaches $ 1.30 .

'' but the committee said an amendment was needed to ensure cases were not brought . `` however , in exempting fishing , the government should be careful to ensure that those persons who catch fish are not given 'carte blanche ' to inflict unnecessary suffering in the course of pursuing this activity , '' the committee added . the committee also said some legal protections for animals were downgraded by the bill , such as the law on abandonment of animals which `` would be significantly weakened '' . mps urged the government to redraft clauses relating to the prosecution of cruelty offences . this was because as it stood the draft bill would allow certain acts that should be prosecuted - such as unnecessary suffering caused to an animal through neglect , or unnecessary mental suffering - to go unpunished . committee chairman michael jack said : `` any change in the law as it affects animals always arouses powerful emotions and great public interest . `` this draft bill is no exception . my committee welcomes the development of an approach to animal welfare which does n't just wait for a problem to occur but enables action to be taken to protect animals before irreversible suffering takes place .
