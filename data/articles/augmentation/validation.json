'' but there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too , according to gartner , as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology . this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade , said gartner . third generation mobiles ( 3g ) with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer , like video , could drive people into upgrading their phones , but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen . `` at the end of the day , people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who do n't really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical . '' nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own . the majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms . more likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics , as well as music services . the motorola razr v3 phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in 2005 , she added . this was not a `` women 's thing '' , she said , but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self-expression too . it was not just about how the phone functioned , but about what it said about its owner . `` western europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design , '' said ms milanesi . `` people are after something that is nice-looking , and together with that , there is the entertainment side . `` this year music will have a part to play in this .

'' voters turned on the party when it failed to reform industrial relations in the 1960s , he also told his audience . oliver letwin said the government had failed to deliver in any of the key public services , such as cleaner hospitals , discipline in schools and putting more police on the streets . he said ministers had not delivered cleaner hospitals , with 5,000 people dying from infections last year . new labour had failed on school discipline because it had not implemented serious reforms so that teachers could run schools , and which would give parents choice , he went on . for the lib dems , simon hughes said many pensioners are means tested for the money they needed and students who were told there would n't be tuition fees and more debt `` have been given exactly the opposite '' . he added : `` under new labour , all households are still paying unfair council tax rather than a fairer alternative .

'' the proposed question for the constitution referendum is : `` should the united kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the european union ? '' the electoral commission on thursday said it was satisfied the question was easy to understand . the government has suggested the referendum on the constitution could take place in spring 2006 , with the tories set to campaign for a `` no '' vote . mr ancram said ministers were prolonging uncertainty by putting the vote off until the latest date possible . the foreign secretary hit back by saying tory attitudes to europe had helped keep the party out of power for more than a decade . mr straw argued cooperation with european partners could bring a `` level playing field '' on immigration and asylum controls . `` you are setting your face against all of these things , '' he added . for the liberal democrats , sir menzies campbell said the uk should not ignore the need to reform the eu common agricultural policy . change was particularly important for developing countries wanting access to markets , he argued . sir menzies was among those worried about plans , backed by the uk , to lift the arms embargo imposed on china after the tiananmen square massacre . mr straw said no decisions had been taken - chinese human rights had improved but not by enough ."}

'' among them were blogs carrying picture messages , saying `` we are sorry '' for george w bush 's victory and the responses from his supporters . mr nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers , tv and radio . `` we have to acknowledge that in all of these cases , mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas , '' he told the bbc news website . `` but they followed the story , they did n't lead it . '' some parts of the so-called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor , raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs . others , like the french newspaper le monde , have applied a different strategy , offering blogs as part of its content . `` i do n't think the mission and role of journalism is threatened . it is in transition , as society itself is in transition , '' says mr nachison . however , he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst noam chomsky , that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper . `` the one-to-many road of traditional journalism , yes , it is threatened . and professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse , '' says mr nachison . `` the notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what 's acceptable for public consumption and what is n't , that 's gone forever . '' `` with people now walking around with information devices in their pockets , like camera or video phones , we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories .

'' holmes ' drive and determination have always been unquestionable - that is the reason she has battled back from a string of injuries that threatened to see her finish her career empty-handed . but alarm bells start ringing when the kent athlete begins questioning herself . `` will i have as much commitment , desire and energy to go through a major championship ? '' holmes asked in the new year . `` that is what i do n't know . '' at 34 , holmes will also be aware that time is running out . us 400m and 200m legend michael johnson , a five-time olympic gold medallist , retired shortly after his 34th birthday as did britain 's double olympic champion decathlete daley thompson . the physical demands of the day-to-day grind will only get harder for holmes , who has already admitted she `` does n't like the training anymore . '' whilst out on the circuit the allure of defeating a double olympic champion will spur her opponents on . holmes will not want to needlessly suffer the indignity of being beaten . unless she is certain she has a strong chance of winning any race , she will not step onto the track . but if the kent athlete finds the form that fuelled her ambitions last summer , there are more prizes up for grabs . the day after completing her double in athens , the 34-year-old revealed she would still like to win her first indoors title . holmes ' wish could easily be met in madrid before she goes on to prepare for the outdoor season where there are still scores to be settled , such as a first gold at the world championships in helsinki . there is just one small truth which could gnaw away at holmes ' motivation - the realisation that no matter how hard she trains , nothing she wins now can surpass her achievements in athens . on the other hand , if those achievements can not be matched should n't they be at least shared and celebrated ? `` you do n't get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double olympic champion , '' agreed cram . `` you want to be able to take your bow in front of the fans because it 's a fantastic feeling . `` i think deep down kelly wants to run . i think she will compete and run races on the circuits but whether or not she runs in the major championships is much less certain . '' athletics fans had every reason to believe they would see the new-look kelly holmes tearing up the track again . after her olympic glory she emphatically denied she planned to retire . so , why is holmes dragging her heels about making a decision on where , when or whether to even bother competing again ? `` that 's just kelly , '' explains cram . `` she 's always been like that . `` she enjoys people trying to guess what she is going to do next . she knows every time she makes a pronouncement now it 's headline news . `` kelly has to figure out for herself what it is she wants and that will be based on athletics decisions , whether she can be competitive , if she is fit enough to put her neck on the line . `` and if she decides not to run again , no-one is going to turn round and say 'you 're making the wrong decision .

'' mr clarke 's comments came in response to an emergency question from liberal democrat constitutional affairs spokesman david heath . mr heath said the judgement contained `` unprecedented condemnation and could not have been more unequivocal '' . he said he accepted the difficult balance between the nation 's security and human rights but questioned why the home office had made `` no contingency plans for the present circumstances '' . `` these detainees should be prosecuted and tried . simply renewing the present deeply unsatisfactory legislation is not an option .

'' but the government was widely criticised for insisting the detentions would continue following the ruling last week . lord bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions `` in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status '' by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects , but not britons . lord nicholls of birkenhead , in his ruling , said : `` indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law . '' the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home office 's powers to hold them without limit or charge . the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 september attacks in the us ."}

'' ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop . `` people want portability , '' she said , `` and with peer-to-peer they have 100 % portability . '' cory doctorow , european co-ordinator for the electronic frontier foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues , expressed doubts that the marlin system would achieve its aims . `` not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying , '' he said . he said many firms readily admit that their drm systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy . instead , said mr doctorow , drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers . `` the studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the ipod version , the auto version , the american and uk version , the ringtone version , and so on .

'' that visual channel is run from a computer within the radio station , and sends out different kinds of information to the handset depending on what you are listening to . as well as details on the track or artist of a particular song , there is also the ability to interact immediately with the radio station itself , in a similar way to digital television 's `` red button '' content . possible interactive content includes competitions , votes and even the chance to rate the song that is playing . but the interactive aspect will make the service especially attractive to radio stations , who will be able to track the number of people taking part in such activities on a real-time basis . this in turn should lead to an additional source of revenue , as it is very likely that advertisers will be keen to exploit new opportunities to reach listeners . as the visual radio content is transmitted by existing gprs technology you would need to have that service enabled by your network . and there will be a cost for the service as well , although it may depend on your usage . `` if you enjoy the visual channel occasionally and interact it 'll be two or three pounds per month , '' said mr wasenius . `` but typically what we see happening is the operator offering a package deal for an 'all you can eat ' arrangement per month . '' the payment system could therefore be similar to the way that broadband internet works versus dial-up connections . one thing that is for sure - assuming that nokia retains its market share in handsets , it is estimating that there will be 100 million visual radio-enabled mobile phones in circulation by the end of 2006 . `` basically , visual radio is not really revolutionary , but rather an evolution where we are providing tools with which people can participate in radio much more easily than ever before . '' the first visual radio service in the uk will begin in a few months time with virgin radio , who are positive about the impact it could have on their listeners . station manager steve taylor commented : `` listeners can interact with the radio station in a new way . `` not only does this give listeners more information on the music we play but means they can instantly purchase things they like ; mp3 music downloads and the latest gig tickets . '' initially visual radio functionality will be limited to two nokia handsets due out soon - the 3230 and 7710 - but if successful , it is very likely that other manufacturers will want to join them . listen again to the interview on the radio five live website ."}

'' the speech , which was peppered with references to mr howard 's humble beginnings as the `` child of immigrants '' , had been introduced by his son nick , a trainee vicar , who praised his father 's honesty . `` i always know where i am with him because all my life he has meant what he has said to me , '' he said . mr howard was also joined on stage by his wife sandra , daughter larissa and stepson sholto . the audience 's reaction to all of this was a little muted by party conference standards . but mr howard 's overall message - that the tories have labour on the run and that they can win the next election - did not sound quite as hollow as it might have done six months ago . mr howard claimed , with some justification , that the tories ' campaign has got off to a `` great start '' . they have had labour on the back foot over immigration , with tony blair hastily adding a sixth promise on the issue to his latest pledge card , and have even managed to score points in traditional labour territory such as health and education . the stunts involving margaret dixon with her postponed operation and maria hutchings with concerns about her son 's special needs education may not have been to everyone 's taste , but they succeeded in bringing the issues alive and forcing labour to react . senior tories believe they are , at long last , starting to tap into the public mood , cutting through the background noise to connect with the ordinary voter . their latest poster campaign flags up a range of policies from better school discipline , cleaner hospitals ( `` i mean , how hard is it to keep a hospital clean ? '' ) and immigration ( `` it 's not racist to impose limits on immigration '' ) - under the headline `` are you thinking what we are thinking ? '' this , they say , contrasts with labour 's negative campaigning , such as its now infamous `` flying pigs '' poster . oliver letwin , one of the men lampooned in the labour poster , affects bewilderment at what he believes is labour 's loss of its once sure footing on the campaign trail . the peter hain `` mongrel '' attack , he says , is just the latest example of the party getting the tone wrong - a by-product , he claims , of the tories setting the agenda . `` i have to say i do n't understand what they are doing . the labour machine appears to be in some kind of state of shock , it does n't seem to know what to do . '' a few weeks of positive headlines have also done wonders for tory activists ' morale - likely to be a crucial factor at an election which , most analysts seem to agree , will hinge on which party can get their core support out . `` it has been a fantastic few weeks , '' said 20-year-old politics student nick vaughan . `` our policies have been getting in the media and there is a sense that we can win . i would n't be here if i did n't think we could . '' some delegates even spoke of the next election being like 1970 , when ted heath , behind in the polls and written off by the pundits , snatched victory from harold wilson 's labour party . they all insisted it was not going to be a re-run of 2001 . `` we thought in 2001 we were going to dent that massive majority but it just did n't happen , '' said john murray , of aldridge browhills conservatives . `` it was very disappointing . this time it really is different . `` whoever is running our strategy from the top has got it bang on . blair is on the back foot . '' much of the credit for the tories ' recent change of fortune must go to lynton crosby , the australian strategist who succeeded in turning political veteran and apparent no-hoper john howard , of australia 's liberal party , into a serial election winner . the tories still have a mountain climb if michael howard is to walk through the doors of number 10 . even allowing for the natural bias against the tories in some opinion polls , they are still behind , when to have a chance of overturning labour 's whopping majority , they should really be ahead . but as they gear up for the start of the campaign proper , the party at least has reason to hope that , like his australian namesake , mr howard really is n't finished yet ."}

'' the key to any successful bid will be attracting the support of united 's largest shareholders , the irish horse racing tycoons john magnier and jp mcmanus . through their cubic expression vehicle they own 28.9 % of the club . mr glazer owns 28.1 % . joe mclean , a football specialist at accountancy firm grant thornton , said the support of mr magnier and mr mcmanus was `` utterly crucial '' . `` mr glazer 's bid will not proceed without their support and they have previously indicated that they are holding their stake as an investment . `` if that 's the case , the shares will therefore need a price attachment of about 300 pence , maybe 305 . `` if that 's the case then mr glazer might well secure their support - if he does , this bid could well go ahead . '' indeed it is . malcolm glazer was little-known in the uk until he started to build up his stake in manchester united in late 2003 . in february 2004 he said he was `` considering '' whether to bid for the club . no bid emerged , but mr glazer continued to increase his holding in the club . in october 2004 , manchester united said they had received a `` preliminary approach '' , which turned out to have come from mr glazer . however , the board rejected the move because of the amount of debt it would involve . at the club 's annual general meeting in november , mr glazer took revenge by using his hefty stake in the club to oust three directors from the board . legal adviser maurice watkins , commercial director andy anson and non-executive director philip yea were voted out , against the wishes of chief executive david gill . but the move led to bankers jp morgan and public relations firm brunswick withdrawing from the glazer bid team ."}

'' but now , he said , laptops can last much longer . it was not just a case of improving battery life by squeezing more out of the lithium ion power packs , he explained . other changes are needed to get to the holy grail of a laptop running for about eight hours before needing a recharge . `` lithium ion is never going to get there by itself , '' he said . `` the industry has done a great job of wringing all possible energy storage out of that technology that they can . '' some new battery chemistries promise to cram more power into the same space , said mr trainor , though work still needed to be done to get them successfully from the lab to manufacturing . he was sceptical that fuel cells would develop quick enough to take over from solid batteries even though they have the potential to produce several times more energy than lithium ion power packs . `` in fuel cells you need to have pumps and separators and evaporation chambers , '' he said . `` it 's a mini energy plant that needs to be shrunk and shrunk and shrunk . '' intel has been working with component makers to test energy consumption on all the parts inside a laptop and find ways to make them less power hungry . this work has led to the creation of the mobile pc extended battery life ( ebl ) working group that shares information about building notebooks that are more parsimonious with power . some of the improvements in power use come simply because components on chips are shrinking , said mr trainor . intel has also changed the way it creates transistors on silicon to reduce the power they need . on a larger scale , said mr trainor , improvements in the way that voltage regulators are made can reduce the amount of power lost as heat and make a notebook more energy efficient . also , said mr trainor , research is being done on ways to cut energy consumption on displays - currently the biggest power guzzler on a laptop . many laptop makers have committed to creating 14 and 15 inch screens that draw only three watts of power . this is far below the power consumption levels of screens in current notebooks . `` if we can get close to eight hours that 's a place that people see as extraordinarily valuable that 's what the industry has to deliver , '' mr trainor said ."}

'' ongc , which is majority-owned by the indian state , already has bought petroleum assets in countries including vietnam , sudan and russia . the company is a partner with rosneft in the sakhalin-1 oil field off russia 's siberian coast . ongc is , however , not the only firm interested in yugansk . chinese crude company china national petroleum has also been mentioned as a possible investor , while on thursday , italy refused to rule out an interest . ongc 's interest is the latest twist in a saga that has seen one of the world 's biggest oil producers brought to its knees . the dispute is partly driven by president putin 's clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-yukos boss mikhail khodorkovsky , who is currently in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion . yukos has been battling the russian authorities for more than a year and has filed for bankruptcy protection in the us . analysts have questioned how long it can continue to survive without yugansk . on thursday , a us court said it will hear arguments for yukos ' bankruptcy claim to be thrown out on 16 february . should that happen , yukos will have little chance of clawing back its assets , analysts said ."}

'' `` we saw potential for substantial consumer harm here , '' he added . the swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones . the drafting of the new rules was led by the mobile entertainment forum and the uk 's phone firms . `` everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct , '' said andrew bud , regulatory head of the mef and executive chairman of messaging firm mblox . `` it 's all about transparency , '' he said . `` consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it .

{"id": 154, "label": 4, "text": "what price for 'trusted pc security ' ? you can now buy `` trusted computers '' , but can we really trust the pc vendors , asks technology analyst bill thompson . if you have recently bought an ibm thinkvantage computer , a dell optiplex , or one of a whole range of laptops from toshiba , hp/compaq or samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realised . inside your shiny new pc is an extra chip called the trusted platform module ( tpm ) that can be used for a range of hardware-based security features . eventually the tpm will be built into the main processor itself , and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own , from mobile phones to tv set top boxes to children 's toys . but for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware , providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them . and as part of a well-designed network system , it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today . a big advantage of the tpm is that it is hardware-based . at the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure . it might be password-protected user accounts , data encryption programs or a firewall , but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor . hardware security is less common , even if it is a lot safer . this is partly because it is more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password , but also because its more work for users , systems administrators and managers . as a result we settle for second best . so when it comes to computer security , trusted systems could be a major step forward . after all , if you have a laptop that will only run programs that have been digitally signed then it will be a lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run . and if all your files are locked automatically then even if you get your computer stolen your personal data will be safeguarded . at the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems . instead you have to use special software , like hp 's protecttools or wave systems ' embassy . this provides file encryption , password management and identity protection , usually for business users who connect to company networks . full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from microsoft until the next release of windows , `` longhorn '' . this will include what microsoft , in a typical act of obscurantism , calls the `` next generation secure computing base '' , and it will give user-level programs access to the trusted computing hardware . when that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities , and no doubt the windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall . however there is a downside to the increased security from viruses , spyware and data theft that this will provide . because the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management ( drm ) systems more secure , this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music , movies and books that we have bought from them . we have seen recently how allowing digital rights management services into our lives can lead to unwelcome consequences . users of apple 's itunes used to be able to stream the music they had brought to up to five other itunes users , a great way of letting your mates discover your music collection . but the latest version of itunes limits this capability , just as an earlier upgrade reduced the number of times you could burn a selected playlist of purchased songs to a cd . another took away the ability to play songs downloaded from real 's harmony service on your ipod . apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management . once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law . similarly , users of tivo digital video recorders have found that they can not record some shows , and other programmes that they have recorded are automatically deleted after a day . this happens because of changes that tivo have made to their software , and the users can not control it . one wonders whether hardware-based drm will work for those who believe that locking-down digital content is a bad idea , and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away . it will not work because of the fundamental flaw at the heart of the system : in order for the purchaser to view the content it has to be unlocked . once it is unlocked then someone , somewhere , will figure out a way to make a copy of the unlocked version . and once an unlocked version leaks onto the network it will be uncontrollable . the efforts going into drm would be much better spent building efficient distribution services , finding business models that are based on trusting your customers , and offering high quality downloads at fair prices . what we want is not so much a trusted computing platform as a trusted customer platform . the record companies and the film industry need to recognise that most of us , most of the time , will pay a reasonable amount for good quality material . they will benefit more by building a market in which i can share songs with my friends , record shows i want to watch later , and burn cds for my kids ; a market which respects the spirit of copyright law and does not seek to replace it by restrictive contracts or end user agreements . we need to ensure that trusted computing remains under the control of the users and is not used to take away the freedoms we enjoy today . bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital ."}

'' `` there , nobody will use it for the conventional uses of a pc , word processing and powerpoint , '' he said . `` so it 's clear to me that if people wanted to use pcs in a village - it has to usable by illiterate people and it must be primarily for entertainment , education , telemedicine , and access to expert advice . '' prof reddy also thinks that tying it into some kind of aid package was the wrong approach . after all , he asked -- what aid group could possibly give expensive computers to 250 million less fortunate indians , let alone the billions of poor people around the world ? instead , prof reddy decided to think of those 250 million indians as a potential market . the problem then becomes one of making the product compelling enough . `` it must be so compelling that you would give up your third meal in order to have this , '' prof reddy says . `` people do this today with television sets . if you go to india , and many other countries , they will first go get a television set before they worry about one more meal . why ? because personalized entertainment has become very important . '' this hatched a completely new idea . he calls it a pctvt - a personal computer , television and telephone all in one that runs on a normal desktop machine . literate users can surf through the applications with a keyboard and mouse but illiterate users can use what looks like a television remote control . on the screen , pictures - not words - designate applications like tv , voice mail , and video e-mail . this dependence on graphics , video and audio means that a computer for an illiterate person needs 100 times more power and more memory than one for a phd . prassana rambathla , one of prof reddy 's graduate students , says that `` when you 're talking illiterate you 're talking audio and video , and that demands exponentially high bandwidth . ' `` it ca n't choke at any point in time , and it has to withstand anything no matter what you 're pressing . '' `` the major part is making it foolproof , very tough , so that it never breaks , '' he says . the carnegie mellon team says this project is only possible because pcs are now so much cheaper and have built-in audio and video hardware and software . limited trials of the pctvt are due to start this month in the indian state of andhra pradesh . although andhra pradesh has a fairly good infrastructure but work has to be done to ensure reliable connections to the net . prof reddy has teamed up with eric brewer at the university of california at berkeley . the answer , says prof brewer , is wi-fi . `` we 're looking at the thing you 'll see in starbuck 's or many other hotspots , '' he says . `` we 're doing a lot of work on long-distance wireless and how to make the network work better in the presence of intermittency , when the power goes up and down , and the links go up and down , and the computers you 're connected to just get turned off for no reason . '' prof reddy says he hopes to lease the pctvts for about $ 10 a month , and thinks indians will rent the units for the television and dvd capabilities . reddy says he can then introduce the pctvt 's other technologies - such as video mail . for example , a farmer could use the pctvt 's webcam to send a picture of a harmful insect to a local official who could send back a proposed course of action to the farmer . prof reddy thinks this kind of communication is the real pay-off . `` the underlying problem , '' he says , `` is how you can increase their wealth and reduce their poverty and reduce their illiteracy , and improve their health care . ' `` and what i 'm postulating is that this is the technology that will enable them . if i did n't have it , it would be an uphill battle . even with the technology it 's an uphill battle . but i have a tool . there is hope . i can reach them in ways that have not been possible before .

'' they struggled to attract record company attention , later being described as `` pretty damn average '' and `` strange and eerie '' by scouts who saw them live . they released two ireland-only singles , which topped the national charts in 1979 and 1980 , leading to a deal with island and their debut album boy . the stadium-filling , anthemic sound was u2 's aim from the start , and their third album , war , saw them make the breakthrough on both sides of the atlantic , going to number one in the uk and 12 in the us . songs like sunday bloody sunday and new year 's day brought success and an image as a political and spiritual band - which bono rejected as a cliche . his stage performances - which included flag-waving , speaker-climbing and drum-throwing - earned him a reputation as an electric performer , and their appearance at 1985 's live aid is widely seen as sealing their global stardom . in 1987 , the joshua tree broke sales records and saw the band reach the height of their powers with hits including where the streets have no name , i still have n't found what i 'm looking for and with or without you . those songs took the band 's epic , atmospheric sound to a simple , powerful and popular pinnacle . the end of the decade marked a crucial point for the band - they had reached the top but still yearned for new challenges and achievements . these came in the form of explorations of different branches of rock and forays into electronic dance music , plus wildly extravagant stage shows , while still trying to retain their mass appeal . the achtung baby album in 1991 was followed by zooropa , pop and their corresponding stadium tours , which featured giant olives , flying cars , live phone calls to the white house and bono 's transformation into alter-egos the fly and macphisto . he was also building a parallel reputation - not always to the pleasure of his bandmates - as a campaigner on issues from global debt to aids . before the release of how to dismantle an atomic bomb , they had sold 125 million albums around the world . but they still want more ."}

'' the system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network . but mr herren says there are both pros and cons to the project . `` it 's very simple to set up , just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school , but it 's also a one-way connection , so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult .

'' the idea of a `` civic commons '' was originally proposed by stephen coleman , professor of e-democracy at the oxford internet institute . the ippr report points to informal , small scale examples of such commons that already exist . it mentions good-practice public initiatives like the bbc 's ican project which connects people locally and nationally who want to take action around important issues . but he adds , government could play a bigger role in setting up systems of trust for online communities too . proposals for id cards , for instance , could also be widened to see if they could be used online . they could provide the basis for a secure authentication system which could have value for peer-to-peer interaction online . `` at the moment they have been presented as a way for government to keep tabs on people and ensuring access to public services , '' said mr davies . `` but what has not been explored is how authentication technology may potentially play a role in decentralised online communities . '' the key idea to take from systems such as ebay and other online communities is letting members rate each other 's reputation by how they treat other members . using a similar mechanism , trust and cooperation between members of virtual and physical communities could be built . this could mean a civic commons would work within a non-market system which lets people who may disagree with one another interact within publicly-recognised rules . e-government initiatives over the last decade have very much been about putting basic information and service guides online as well as letting people interact with government via the web . many online communities , such as chatrooms , mailing lists , community portals , message boards and weblogs often form around common interests or issues . with 53 % of uk households now with access to the net , the government , suggests mr davies , could act as an intermediary or `` middleman '' to set up public online places of debate and exchange to encourage more `` cosmopolitan politics '' and public trust in policy . `` government already plays a critical role in helping citizens trade with each other online . `` but it should also play a role in helping citizens connect to one another in civic , non-market interactions , '' said mr davies . there is a role for public bodies like the bbc , libraries , and government to bring people back into public debate again instead of millions of `` cliques '' talking to each other , he added . the paper is part of the ippr 's digital society initiative which is producing a number of conferences and research papers leading up to the publication of a manifesto for a digital britain ."}

'' with broadband penetration reaching 100 % in the uk , businesses with a stake in the technology want to give people reasons to want and use it . the creative drive is not purely altruistic obviously . it is about both industries borrowing strategies and creative ideas together which can result in better business practices for creative industries , or more patent ideas for tech companies . `` what we are trying to do is have outside-in thinking . `` we are creating a future cultural drive for the economy , '' said mr stone ."}

'' but he said the nhs in wales also needed to create a healthier population rather than respond only to ill health , and a balanced view of priorities was important . `` we do need a consistent across-the-board approach , recognising the patients ' experience of how they use the service is going to be , at the end of the day , the main test of how the service is working . '' he said nhs staff wanted a period of consolidation after `` tremendous change and reform '' . later , dr gibbons praised the work of ms hutt , saying he `` agreed with everything she 's done '' to change the health service in wales . dr gibbons said he accepted there was a problem , but his job now was to build on the foundations put in place by his predecessor . he also acknowledged that until the waiting list issue was sorted out , the rest of the assembly government 's health policy would be overshadowed . opposition members and some labour mps had long called for ms hutt 's removal after sustained criticism over extended hospital waiting times . first minister rhodri morgan told bbc wales he had agreed with ms hutt in 2003 that she would not be health minister in the run-up to the 2007 elections . `` she 's been doing the job for five years and eight months and , apart from nye bevan himself , ( architect of the nhs ) , i do n't think anybody has ever done the job for so long . '' mr morgan said he had only told ms hutt of the reshuffle on monday morning , and said the nhs in wales was dr gibbons ' `` baby '' now . in response to dr gibbons ' comments , ieuan wyn jones , leader of the plaid cymru group in the assembly , said : `` it is apparent that this reshuffle by the first minister was just changing the deckchairs on a sinking titanic . '' kisrty williams , for the lib dems , added : `` if the underlying policy is going to continue , then changing the minister will serve no purpose , other than to deflect flak from labour 's mps , '' she said . meanwhile ms hutt said she hoped `` that the people of wales would benefit from my investment of the past five years and eight months '' asked about waiting lists , she said that waiting times and lists were `` only 10 % of the health agenda '' and that the welsh assembly government had `` turned the corner '' on the issue ."}
