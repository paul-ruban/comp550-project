bush to get 'tough ' on deficit us president george w bush has pledged to introduce a `` tough '' federal budget next february in a bid to halve the country 's deficit in five years . the us budget and its trade deficit are both deep in the red , helping to push the dollar to lows against the euro and fuelling fears about the economy . mr bush indicated there would be `` strict discipline '' on non-defence spending in the budget . the vow to cut the deficit had been one of his re-election declarations . the federal budget deficit hit a record $ 412bn ( â£211.6bn ) in the 12 months to 30 september and $ 377bn in the previous year . `` we will submit a budget that fits the times , '' mr bush said . `` it will provide every tool and resource to the military , will protect the homeland , and meet other priorities of the government . '' the us has said it is committed to a strong dollar . but the dollar 's weakness has hit european and asian exporters and lead to calls for us intervention to boost the currency . mr bush , however , has said the best way to halt the dollar 's slide is to deal with the us deficit . `` it 's a budget that i think will send the right signal to the financial markets and to those concerned about our short-term deficits , '' mr bush added . `` as well , we 've got to deal with the long-term deficit issues .
