laporte tinkers with team france coach bernard laporte has made four changes to the starting line-up that beat england for saturday 's six nations clash with wales . he opted for yannick nyanga in the back row instead of grand slam winner imanol harinordoquy , who is back in the squad . other changes see julien laharrague win his first cap at full-back , aurelien rougerie return after injury on the wing and yannick jauzion in at centre . but laporte has resisted fan pressure to start frederic michalak at fly-half . the dependable yann delaigue keeps the number 10 jersey , despite clamours for the flair of michalak . the 26-year-old laharrague gets his chance despite playing on the wing for his club brive . `` we are launching him into the great international level , '' said team manager jo maso . `` he is young and this is a great opportunity for us and above all for him . `` there are 25 matches left before the world cup so we must see as many players as possible . the competition is very high and open . '' jauzion , france 's player of the year in 2004 , would probably have played in the first two matches instead of the south african-born liebeneberg had he been fit . the stade toulousain star wins his 23rd cap and is reunited with damien traille , with whom he forged an effective midfield in 2004 . `` the return of jauzion is going to be a plus for us , '' said laporte . `` we are going to test him at an international level .
