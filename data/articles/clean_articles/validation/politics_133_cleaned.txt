jowell rejects 'las vegas ' jibe the secretary of state for culture , media and sport , tessa jowell , has hit out at critics of the gambling bill . she told the guardian newspaper there would be no `` las vegas-style '' super-casinos , as rumoured in the press . meanwhile labour backbencher stephen pound labelled casino-related regeneration schemes `` a pile of pants '' . the mp for ealing north claimed the legislation would encourage a mafia-like culture of vice and corruption , in an interview on bbc radio 4 . `` you look at some of the people who are involved ... they are n't in there to regenerate blackpool . they are in it to fill their boots , '' mr pound told the today programme . `` i just really think that we have made a terrible mistake here . and over all of it hangs the shadow of the men in the chalk-stripe suits with names that rhyme with spaghetti , '' he said . ms jowell complained of the `` scale of misrepresentation '' in the media over the bill in her interview with the newspaper , her first since the bill was launched . the culture secretary said a four year consultation period had produced a consensus on the need to `` protect children and the vulnerable '' in a swiftly changing sector . ms jowell insisted : `` we have a good track record for extracting planning gain in this country , for instance in social housing . '' and continued : `` we can be proud to have one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the world . i intend to keep it that way . '' ms jowell will set out her position when the bill is debated in the commons on monday . in prime minister 's questions last week tony blair assured parliament that 90 % of the bill was about tightening up the regulation of the gambling industry .
