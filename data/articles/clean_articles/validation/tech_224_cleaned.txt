disney backs sony dvd technology a next generation dvd technology backed by sony has received a major boost . film giant disney says it will produce its future dvds using sony 's blu-ray disc technology , but has not ruled out a rival format developed by toshiba . the two competing dvd formats , blu-ray developed by sony and others , and toshiba 's hd-dvd , have been courting top film studios for several months . the next generation of dvds promises very high quality pictures and sound , as well as a lot of data . both technologies use a blue laser to write information . it has a shorter wavelength so more data can be stored . disney is the latest studio to announce which technology it is backing in a format battle which mirrors the 1980s betamax versus vhs war . sony lost out to jvc in that fight . the current battle for hollywood 's hearts and minds is a crucial one because high-definition films will bring in billions of revenue and the studios would prefer to use one standard . last month , paramount , universal and warner brothers said they were opting for the toshiba and nec-backed format , hd-dvd high-definition discs . those studios currently produce about 45 % of dvd content . sony pictures entertainment and mgm studios have already staked their allegiance with the blu-ray disc association , whose members also include technology companies dell , samsung and matsushita . twentieth century fox is still to announce which technology it will be supporting . if fox decided to go with blu-ray too , it would mean the format would have a 47 % share of dvd content . disney said its films would be available on the blu-ray format when dvd players for the standard went on sale on north america and japan , expected in 2006 . universal is to start producing films on the hd-dvd format in 2005 , and paramount will start releasing titles using the standard in 2006 . toshiba expects sales of hd-dvds to reach 300bn yen ( $ 2.9bn , â£1.5bn ) by 2010 .
