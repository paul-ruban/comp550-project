howard backs stem cell research michael howard has backed stem cell research , saying it is important people are not frightened of the future . the controversial issue was a feature of the recent us presidential election , where george bush opposed extending it . but the tory leader argued there was a moral case for embracing science which could help victims of alzheimer 's , parkinson 's and motor neurone disease . `` i believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses , '' he said . the use of embryonic stem cells in the uk is already allowed . stem cells are master cells that have the ability to develop into any of the body 's tissue types . scientists hope that by growing such cells in the laboratory they can programme them to form specific tissue such as kidney , heart or even brain tissue . mr howard acknowledged there were genuine concerns about stem cell research . but he argued : `` we must n't be frightened of change or nostalgic about the past - we must be optimistic about the future . `` politicians must create the right framework so that the great potential of science can be harnessed for the benefit of mankind . `` with the life expectancy of the average briton now around the mid-70s , society has a responsibility to enhance the quality of people 's lives as they grow older . `` i know many people are concerned about stem-cell research . they are fearful of meddling with what they see as the stuff of souls . `` i respect those concerns . but i also believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses like parkinson 's , multiple sclerosis , motor neurone disease , alzheimer 's and - as we saw in the papers today - now possibly heart problems . '' mr howard acknowledged there were `` no easy answers '' over such an issue but it was necessary to `` have the courage to do what we know to be morally right '' . he added : `` of course , stem cells are still a recent discovery . more research needs to be done . but we must look at their potential in a responsible and grown-up way . the hopes of millions of people rest on what could be achieved . '' former superman actor the late christopher reeve was an advocate for the research after he was paralysed in a horse riding accident . mr howard made his remarks during a speech in westminster to the conservative national women 's committee on ambitions and values .
