benitez issues warning to gerrard liverpool manager rafael benitez has ordered captain steven gerrard not to play down their champions league ambitions and be more positive . gerrard told the bbc liverpool were unlikely to win the trophy this year . benitez responded : `` i spoke to steven and said to him that in future it 's better to think we can win the champions league . why not ? '' he said : `` we need winners here and everyone thinking only of winning . i always want to win . '' benitez added : `` when we lose i only think of solutions . if you only think about winning the next game , you do n't know what the draw will be . `` if we can win the next game , maybe we will draw a side that is n't so strong , or a side with injuries or suspensions . '' benitez is hoping to win his first trophy since arriving at liverpool from valencia when they play chelsea in the carling cup on sunday in cardiff .
