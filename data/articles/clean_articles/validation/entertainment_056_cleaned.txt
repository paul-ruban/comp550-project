brando 'rejected godfather role' late film star marlon brando is said to have repeatedly turned down his oscar-winning role in the godfather . the actor 's friend budd schulberg told vanity fair magazine that brando 's assistant suggested he read the novel . the actor repeatedly refused , throwing the book at her and saying : `` for the last time , i wo n't glorify the mafia '' . but brando , who died last july at the age of 80 , eventually took the role of don corleone , winning him an oscar in 1973 which he notoriously refused . the actor sent a young woman dressed in native american costume to refuse the award on his behalf and to draw attention to the plight of native americans . schulberg told the magazine that brando 's assistant realised the film star had warmed to the idea of the godfather role when he sported a drawn-on pencil moustache and asked : `` how do i look ? '' his assistant , alice marchak , said that he looked like george raft , an actor famed for playing gangsters on the silver screen . every time she went to see brando from then on , she added , he was wearing a different gangster-style moustache . brando was asked to screen test for the role in the godfather , as studio executives were said to be reluctant for the actor to play the part following problems on the set of brando 's previous film mutiny on the bounty . in fact brando 's academy award triumph revived his career . the actor was nominated for an oscar the following year for his role in bernardo bertolucci 's last tango in paris . before his death , brando granted gaming company electronic arts the rights to use his voice and image in a video game based on the godfather film and book and recorded voice-overs which closely resembled his role as don corleone . brando 's co-stars from the godfather , james caan and robert duvall , will also reprise their roles for the video game , it was confirmed on wednesday .
