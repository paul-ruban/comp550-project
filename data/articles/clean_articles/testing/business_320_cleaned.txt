iraq and afghanistan in wto talks the world trade organisation ( wto ) is to hold membership talks with both iraq and afghanistan . but iran 's bid to join the trade body has been refused after the us blocked its application for the 21st time . the countries stand to reap huge benefits from membership of the group , whose purpose is to promote free trade . joining , however , is a lengthy process . china 's admission in 2001 took 15 years and talks with russia and saudi arabia have been taking place for 10 years . membership of the geneva-based wto helps guarantee a country 's goods receives equal treatment in the markets of other member states - a policy which has seen it become closely associated with globalisation . iraq 's trade minister mohammed mustafa al-jibouri welcomed the move , describing it as significant as november 's decision by the paris club of creditor nations to write off 80 % of the country 's debts . assad omar , afghanistan 's envoy to the united nations in geneva , said accession would contribute to `` regional prosperity and global security '' . there are now 27 countries seeking membership of the wto . prospective members need to enter into negotiations with potential trading countries and change domestic laws to bring them in line with wto regulations . before the process gets under way , all 148 wto members must give their backing to applicant countries . the us said it could not approve iran 's application because it is currently reviewing relations . but several nations criticised the approach , and european union ambassador to the wto , carlo trojan , said iran 's application `` must be treated independently of political issues '' .
