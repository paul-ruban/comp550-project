nigeria to boost cocoa production the government of nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme . agriculture minister adamu bello said the scheme aimed to boost production from an expected 180,000 tonnes this year to 600,000 tonnes by 2008 . the government will pump 154m naira ( $ 1.1m ; â£591,000 ) into subsidies for farming chemicals and seedlings . nigeria is currently the world 's fourth-largest cocoa producer . cocoa was the main export product in nigeria during the 1960s . but with the coming of oil , the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970 . at the launch of the programme in the south-western city of ibadan , mr bello explained that an additional aim of the project is to encourage the processing of cocoa in the country and lift local consumption . he also announced that 91m naira of the funding available had been earmarked for establishing cocoa plant nurseries . the country could be looking to emulate rival ghana , which produced a bumper crop last year . however , some farmers are sceptical about the proposals . `` people who are not farming will hijack the subsidy , '' said joshua osagie , a cocoa farmer from edo state told reuters . `` the farmers in the village never see any assistance , '' he added . at the same time as nigeria announced its new initiative , ghana - the world 's second largest cocoa exporter - announced revenues from the industry had broken new records . the country saw more than $ 1.2bn-worth of the beans exported during 2003-04 . analysts said high tech-production techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to the huge crop , pushing production closer to levels seen in the 1960s when the country was the world 's leading cocoa grower .
