lib dems demand new inquiry a judge should look into the david blunkett controversy as key questions remain unanswered , the lib dems say . sir alan budd 's inquiry linked the ex-home secretary to the speeding up of a visa claim by his ex-lover 's nanny . but he could not say whether mr blunkett had treated the nanny as a special case or had used her as an example of immigration problems . lib dem spokesman mark oaten said the number of officials who had forgotten what happened was worrying . he told bbc news : `` i 'm extremely concerned that 20 individuals appear to have forgotten what happened or more suspiciously are not prepared to say what happened . `` that must be bad for government , it must be bad for public confidence in the system . '' mr oaten said people would be mystified why sir alan 's inquiry failed to uncover why processing of the visa application was speeded up . he said : `` there is a strong case for a judge-led judicial review of this because , of course , next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa . it may be about something even more important than that . `` so we do need to understand what took place and who was involved . '' the tories criticised the lib dem stance , saying mr oaten had initially said he accepted mr blunkett 's word unless further evidence emerged . but lib dem officials say mr oaten was speaking when an inquiry was under way and was avoiding rushing to judgement .
