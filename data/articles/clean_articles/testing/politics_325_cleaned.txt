ukip could sue veritas defectors the uk independence party could take legal action to unseat two london assembly members who defected to robert kilroy silk 's veritas party . damian hockney , now veritas deputy leader , and peter hulme-cross were elected in 2004 on the list system . the party argues the pair should give up their seats as they won them as ukip representatives , not as individuals . mr hockney said the law was clear that those elected on a list who quit their party should keep their seats . ukip chairman petrina holdsworth urged the men to step down from the gla in a letter . she said : `` the party has taken legal advice and it is clear that we could take legal proceedings against you which could result in the return of our seats and/or damages against you . `` we would however like you to be given an opportunity to reflect on what you have done , to restore your own credibility with the electorate and return the seats to the party which won them fair and square at the last election . '' mr hockney said the law worked in exactly the same way for the gla as it did for other electoral list systems . `` the greater london act is clear that if someone resigns who was elected on a list , their party whip the seat belongs to them and not the party . '' he said mr hulme-cross and himself had no intention of resigning and added that they felt that it was ukip who were not being true to the electorate . he accused the party of signing up to a deal with the tories in europe , rather than sticking to an independent stance . but the claim was denied by ukip spokesman , who said : `` mr hockney 's accusations are like his sense of political morals - empty . '' veritas was formed by mr kilroy-silk earlier this month after he quit ukip following an unsuccessful bid to take over as leader .
