baa support ahead of court battle uk airport operator baa has reiterated its support for the government 's aviation expansion plans to airports throughout the country . the comments come a day ahead of a high court challenge by residents ' groups and local councils to the government 's white paper . the judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at heathrow , stansted and luton airports . baa , which operates all three , said it was consulting with local communities . `` we are ... consulting on voluntary compensation schemes which go beyond our statutory obligations , '' a baa spokesman said . groups challenging the plans include stop stansted expansion , heathrow anti-noise campaigners hacan clearskies and the london boroughs of hillingdon and wandsworth . at heathrow , gatwick , edinburgh and glasgow airports , baa launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in september 2004 , which will close next week . the company is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked , unblighted price . among other measures , baa has set up a homeowner support scheme for people living near stansted , and has launched a special scheme for those close to the airport but far enough away not to be covered by the homeowner scheme . at heathrow , baa said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental , air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met . at gatwick , the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway . stop stansted expansion said the white paper , published in december 2003 , was `` fundamentally flawed '' and did not follow the proper consultation process . `` we do not underestimate the scale of the challenge before us because the courts have never before overturned a government white paper , '' said stop stansted expansion chairman peter sanders said . hacan chairman john stewart said : `` almost exactly a year ago the government published its 30-year aviation white paper with much fanfare . `` it hoped that would be the end of the debate and it could proceed with its plans for a massive expansion of aviation . `` yet , a year later the protesters are still here , and stronger than ever. `` a judgement from mr justice sullivan is expected early in february .
