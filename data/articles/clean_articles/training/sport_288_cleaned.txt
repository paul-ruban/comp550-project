lewsey puzzle over disallowed try england 's josh lewsey has claimed he was denied a late try in his side 's six nations loss to ireland . the wasps wing insisted he grounded the ball when he was bundled over the line and said referee jonathan kaplan had made a wrong decision . `` i 'm positive i touched the ball down over the line , '' lewsey told bbc sport . `` it certainly was n't a turnover . `` i was driven over and i put the ball on the ground . the whistle went and i let go of the ball . '' lewsey added : `` one of the irish players scooped it back after the whistle and to our surprise the referee then gave a turnover . `` as far as i 'm concerned , that incident and mark cueto 's effort from charlie hodgson 's cross-field kick that led to what looked like a good try were the two key elements in the game . '' cueto was also puzzled as to why his try had been disallowed by kaplan . `` i do n't think i could have been offside for , without a doubt , i was behind the ball , '' said the sale player . `` the move was a planned technique , it was not off the cuff . we rehearse it time and time again . `` i would n't say we were robbed , some decisions go with you and some go against you . today they went against us and that 's tough at international level .
