us adds more jobs than expected the us economy added 337,000 jobs in october - a seven-month high and far more than wall street expectations . in a welcome economic boost for newly re-elected president george w bush , the labor department figures come after a slow summer of weak jobs gains . jobs were created in every sector of the us economy except manufacturing . while the separate unemployment rate went up to 5.5 % from 5.4 % in september , this was because more people were now actively seeking work . the 337,000 new jobs added to us payrolls in october was twice the 169,000 figure that wall street economists had forecast . in addition , the labor department revised up the number of jobs created in the two previous months - to 139,000 in september instead of 96,000 , and to 198,000 in august instead of 128,000 . the better than expected jobs data had an immediate upward effect on stocks in new york , with the main dow jones index gaining 45.4 points to 10,360 by late morning trading . `` it looks like the job situation is improving and that this will support consumer spending going into the holidays , and offset some of the drag caused by high oil prices this year , '' said economist gary thayer of ag edwards & sons . other analysts said the upbeat jobs data made it more likely that the us federal reserve would increase interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 2 % when it meets next week . `` it should empower the fed to clearly do something , '' said robert macintosh , chief economist with eaton vance management in boston . kathleen utgoff , commissioner of the bureau of labor , said many of the 71,000 new construction jobs added in october were involved in rebuilding and clean-up work in florida , and neighbouring deep south states , following four hurricanes in august and september . the dollar rose temporarily on the job creation news before falling back to a new record low against the euro , as investors returned their attention to other economic factors , such as the us 's record trade deficit . there is also speculation that president bush will deliberately try to keep the dollar low in order to assist a growth in exports .
