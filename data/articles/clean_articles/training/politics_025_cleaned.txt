uk 'needs true immigration data' a former home office minister has called for an independent body to be set up to monitor uk immigration . barbara roche said an organisation should monitor and publish figures and be independent of government . she said this would counter `` so-called independent '' groups like migration watch , which she described as an anti-immigration body posing as independent . migration watch says it is not against all immigration and the government already publishes accurate figures . sir andrew green , chairman of the organisation , says there is no need for an independent body because office of national statistics data are accurate . he says he opposes large-scale immigration `` both on the grounds of overcrowding and culture '' . he said : `` for example , over the next 20 years one household in three will be due to immigration . `` we are already more overcrowded than india and we are four times more overcrowded than france . '' ms roche , labour mp for hornsey and wood green , believes legal migration is something we should welcome . she said her proposals mean `` we would n't have so-called independent experts , like migration watch , who come into this debate from an anti-immigration point of view . '' she went on : `` what i would like to see is there being a body which actually looked at the figures , published them , and was independent of government . `` i think that would go a long way to allaying some of the fears that are sometimes whipped up during this debate .
