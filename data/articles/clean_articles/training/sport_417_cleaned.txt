d'arcy injury adds to ireland woe gordon d'arcy has been ruled out of the ireland team for saturday 's six nations clash against scotland in murrayfield . like skipper brian o'driscoll , d'arcy failed to recover from a hamstring injury . the side will now be led by munster lock paul o'connell . shane horgan switches from wing to centre where he will be joined by ulster 's kevin maggs . girvan dempsey comes into the team to take the right wing spot while gavin duffy is called up to the replacements . ''we gave gordon a chance but it did n't work out , '' said ireland coach eddie o'sullivan . ''in terms of the risk element , it was a sensible precaution . he should be fine for the next game but we do not want to tempt fate . '' maggs , who will win his 67th cap , was the obvious replacement at centre while shane horgan was always likely to be moved from the wing . the only other change to the ireland side from last weekend 's win in rome sees wasps flanker johnny o'connor replacing denis leamy . o'connor will be winning his third cap after making his debut in the victory over south africa last november . : murphy , dempsey , horgan , maggs , hickie , o'gara , stringer , corrigan , byrne , hayes , o'kelly , o'connell , capt , s easterby , o'connor , foley . : sheahan , horan , o'callaghan , miller , g easterby , humphreys , duffy .
