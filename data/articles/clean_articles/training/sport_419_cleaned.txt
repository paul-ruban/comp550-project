tindall aiming to earn lions spot bath and england centre mike tindall believes he can make this summer 's lions tour , despite missing most of the season through injury . the world cup winner has been out of action since december , having damaged both his shoulder and his foot . but tindall , who recently signed for bath 's west-country rivals gloucester , told rugby special he would be fit in time for the tour to new zealand . `` i 'm aiming to be fit by 18 april and hope i can play from then , '' he said . `` i 've spoken to sir clive woodward and he understands the situation , so i just hope that i can get on the tour . '' the 26-year-old will face stiff competition for those centre places from brian o'driscoll , gordon d'arcy and gavin henson , and is aware that competition is intense . but after missing out on the 2001 tour to australia with a knee injury , tindall says he will be happy just to have an opportunity to wear the red shirt . `` i 'm quite laid back about it to be honest - it 's quite hard for me to expect to be pushing for a test spot , '' he said . `` but after what 's happened this season at least clive knows i 'll be 100 % fresh !
