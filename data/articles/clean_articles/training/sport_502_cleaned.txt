minister digs in over doping row the belgian sports minister at the centre of the svetlana kuznetsova doping row says he will not apologise for making allegations against her . claude eerdekens claims the us open champion tested positive for ephedrine at an exhibition event last month . criticised for making the announcement , he said : `` i will never apologise . this product is banned and it 's up to her to explain why it 's there . '' kuznetsova says the stimulant may have been in a cold remedy she took . the russian said she did nothing wrong by taking the medicine during the event . the women 's tennis association cleared kuznetsova of any offence because the drug is not banned when taken out of competition . eerdekens said he made the statement in order to protect the other three players that took part in the tournament , belgian justine henin-hardenne , nathalie dechy of france and russia 's elena dementieva . but dechy is fuming that she has been implicated in the row . `` how can you be happy when you see your face on the cover page and talking about doping ? '' dechy said . `` i 'm really upset about it and i think the belgian government did a really bad job about this . `` i think we deserve an apology from the guy . you can not say anything like this - you can not say some stuff like this , saying it 's one of these girls . this is terrible . '' dementieva is also angry and says that dechy and herself are the real victims of the scandal . `` you have no idea what i have been through all these days . it 's been too hard on me , '' she said . `` the wta are trying to handle this problem by saying there are three victims , but i see only two victims in this story - me and nathalie dechy , who really have nothing to do with this . `` to be honest with you , i do n't feel like i want to talk to sveta at all . i 'm just very upset with the way everything has happened .
