britannia members ' â£42m windfall more than 800,000 britannia building society members are to receive a profit share worth on average â£52 each . members of the uk 's second largest building society will share â£42m , with 100,000 receiving a windfall of more than â£100 . depending on how much they borrow or invest , members earn `` reward '' points which entitle them to a share of the society 's profits . the payouts are bigger than last year , because of stricter eligibility rules . last year , britannia members shared â£42m , but the average payment was only â£38 . to qualify for this year 's payment , customers must have been members for at least two years on 31 december 2004 . britannia has also stopped making payments to members if they are worth less than â£5 . to qualify for the profit share , members must have either a mortgage , or an investment account other than a deposit account . customers can also qualify if they have permanent interest bearing shares ( pibs ) . the profit share scheme was introduced in 1997 and has paid out more than â£370m . britannia will unveil its results on wednesday .
