'few ready ' for information act thousands of public bodies are ill-prepared for the freedom of information act , due to come into force next month , because of government failures , say mps . from next month anyone will have the power to demand information from a range of public bodies - from whitehall departments to doctors ' surgeries . but an all-party committee said it was `` not confident '' many would be ready . it blamed the department for constitutional affairs for a `` lack of consistent leadership '' . the act comes into effect in england , wales and northern ireland , on 1 january while similar measures are being brought in at the same time in scotland . it provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies , subject to various exemptions . but the government department responsible for implementing the change suffered from an `` unusually high turnover '' of staff within the department , which had `` seriously interfered '' with its work , said the constitutional affairs select committee . it said , despite four years of preparations , some local authorities and parts of the health sector were still not ready . the dca had `` failed '' to provide early guidance on technical matters and shown a `` lack of consistent leadership '' , the mps found . committee chairman alan beith said : `` the dca has had four years to prepare for freedom of information , but with less than a month to go it appears that some bodies may not be well enough prepared . `` our report shows that in the past support and guidance from the dca , which has overall responsibility for guiding the public sector through the process of implementation for the freedom of information regime , has been lacking . '' a spokesman for the dca said : `` the dca has provided - and will continue to provide - strong , clear leadership . `` it has delivered a simple , liberal fees regime , guidance on the act which has been widely praised , and expert networks of staff working on freedom of information implementation .
