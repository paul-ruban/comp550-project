call to overhaul uk state pension the uk pension system has been branded inadequate and too complex by a leading retirement think-tank . the pensions policy institute ( ppi ) said replacing the state pension with a `` citizen 's pension '' would help tackle inequality and complexity . the change would see pensions being calculated on length of residency in the uk rather than national insurance ( ni ) contributions . reform could reduce poverty by aiding people with broken employment records . the ppi added that once the state system was reformed the government should look at options to overhaul private and workplace pensions . the think tank 's proposals were made in response to the recent publication of the pensions commission 's initial report into uk retirement savings . according to the pensions commission 's report 12 million working people are not saving enough for their retirement . as a result , living standards could fall for the next generation of uk pensioners . the report added that a combination of higher taxes , higher savings and/or a higher average retirement age was needed to solve the uk pension crisis .
