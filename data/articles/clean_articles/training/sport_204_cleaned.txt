uefa approves fake grass uefa says it will allow european matches to be played on artificial pitches from the start of next season . european football 's governing body made the decision at a meeting of its executive committee on wednesday . uefa explained that the move `` follows comprehensive studies into the sporting and medical aspects of using artificial playing surfaces . '' they can be used subject to complying with uefa quality criteria but there use will not be made obligatory . luton , preston , queens park rangers and other clubs used to have plastic pitches during the the 1980s but , after a two-year study , uefa insists the surfaces have moved on . international matches can also be played on such pitches , although games at major tournaments have to be contested on grass . uefa spokesman rob faulkner said : `` people in england have bad memories of the artificial pitches of luton and qpr in the 1980s , but the latest generation are completely different and are much more like grass . `` we have sanctioned its use from the start of next season but only as long as it is the latest generation of artificial turf and meets a whole series of standards . '' several leading clubs from scandinavia , russia and eastern europe - especially those who only play champions league or uefa cup matches in winter - are now expected to instal artificial pitches .
