kennedy calls for iraq exit plans tony blair should set out a proper exit strategy from iraq in the wake of next sunday 's elections in the country , lib dem leader charles kennedy has said . in a speech focusing on issues arising from the re-election of george w bush , mr kennedy said iraq had become a `` crucible of militant terrorism '' . he wants to see a phased withdrawal of uk troops `` as soon as the situation allows '' , he said in london . any exit strategy must `` augment and support '' the democratic process . `` there are some who are of the opinion that the mere presence of british and american troops in iraq feeds the insurgency , '' he said . `` there is some truth in that , especially after the initial mistakes that were made - the heavy-handedness of operations like fallujah , and the well-publicised instances of abuse at the hands of coalition forces . '' mr kennedy pointed out that the netherlands , portugal and the czech republic , which all have troops operating in the southern sector of iraq , have announced their imminent withdrawal `` regardless of the situation on the ground '' . he accused mr blair 's government of `` being less than straightforward '' over its plans . `` next week the prime minister should make a statement regarding the elections in iraq , '' mr kennedy said during his city of london speech . `` he should set out a proper exit strategy , including the phased withdrawal of british troops , as the security situation allows . '' mr kennedy also argued that british troops deployed in iraq should be replaced with forces from other countries - `` especially islamic countries '' .
