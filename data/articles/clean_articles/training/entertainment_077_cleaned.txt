dvd review : spider-man 2 it 's a universal rule that a film can either be a superhero special effects extravaganza or it can be good . but spider-man 2 breaks that rule in two . it 's not fantastically deep but you get quickly drawn into the tale of spidey versus doc ock and more so into the fate of poor peter parker . gigantic action set pieces seamlessly work with more brooding personal torment and it all looks stunning . a few effects look false but tobey maguire , kirsten dunst and alfred molina make this compelling . the other universal rule is that dvds of superhero films will have making of features only about the effects . this disc covers those special effects enough but as just one part of a detailed look at the film . then there are commentaries , trailers and a blooper reel . sometimes quality comes in bulk : this set contains no less than 34 john wayne films ranging from the westerns and war movies to the quiet man . now is that a christmas present or what ? give this to someone on 24 december and you wo n't see them again until early in the new year . it 's not truly a complete collection and leans more toward wayne 's earlier films : there 's no true grit , for instance , though there is hellraisers . the films look well transferred to dvd , though none has extras . it was very daft but it knew it was and somehow this famous 1979 series became a cult favourite that 's been long awaited on dvd . this set has the first season of buck ( gil gerard ) and wilma 's ( erin gray ) tongue-in-cheek adventures and it 's all as camp and gaudy as you remember . but it 's also a disappointment . the us dvd has this and the more po-faced second season - and you can import it for just about the same price . the bigger omission , though , is that there are no extras . that 's particularly disappointing because originally there were meant to be commentaries and stars gerard and gray had agreed to do them .
