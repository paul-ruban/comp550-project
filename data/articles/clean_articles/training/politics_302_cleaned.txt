galloway targets 'new labour ' mp george galloway is to stand against pro-iraq war labour mp oona king at the next general election . mr galloway , who on thursday won â£150,000 in libel damages from the daily telegraph said he would contest bethnal green , in london , for respect . the glasgow kelvin mp , who was expelled from labour over his anti iraq war stance , accused ms king of being a `` new labour stooge '' . ms king said she was `` delighted '' at the chance to take on mr galloway . mr galloway 's current constituency is set to disappear under planned boundary changes in scotland . the 50-year-old mp launched respect , the unity coalition , in january along with 1,000 anti-war activists , and the muslim association of britain . the party 's declared aims are an end to the occupation of iraq , the repeal of anti-union laws and the end of privatisation . speaking from a cafe in brick lane , east london , mr galloway said he had accepted the party 's invitation to stand with `` great honour and pride '' . he added : `` here in this constituency of bethnal green and bow there is a new labour stooge mp . `` a stooge who will sing any song , make any speech , do any dance , do anything she is told to by tony blair - irrespective of how her constituents are adversely affected or how strongly they feel to the contrary . '' ms king has represented the constituency since 1997 . she said : `` i 'm delighted i 've been given the chance to finish him ( mr galloway ) off , and believe me i will . `` i know many people around the country will be grateful , not least his constituents in scotland who he has shamelessly abandoned . '' in june 's european parliament elections , respect failed to gain enough votes for an mep but did come first in tower hamlets borough , most of which is covered by the commons constituency of bethnal green and bow . a month later it gained a council seat in a by-election in st dunstan 's and stepney green ward , tower hamlets . mr galloway said that in next year 's expected general election and local elections a year later , the party would `` turn the east end of london into a fortress '' . both the conservatives and the liberal democrats have chosen prospective parliamentary candidates for bethnal green and bow from the bangladeshi population , which makes up almost half the electorate . the telegraph was sued for libel by mr galloway after the newspaper claimed he received money from saddam hussein 's regime in iraq . the newspaper said it was in the public interest to publish the claims , based on documents found in baghdad . mr justice eady said he was `` obliged to compensate mr galloway ... and to make an award for the purposes of restoring his reputation '' .
