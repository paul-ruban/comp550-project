ask jeeves joins web log market ask jeeves has bought the bloglines website to improve the way it handles content from web journals or blogs . the bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read , search and share all the blogs they are interested in . ask jeeves said it was not planning to change bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web . how much ask jeeves paid for bloglines was not revealed . bloglines has become popular because it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually . to do this it makes use of a technology known as really simple syndication ( rss ) that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals . the acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites . google acquired pyra labs , makers of the blogger software , in 2003 . in 2004 msn introduced its own blog system and yahoo has tweaked its technology to do a better job of handling blog entries . jim lanzone , vice president of search properties at ask jeeves in the us , said it did not acquire bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world . he said ask jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it . `` the universe of readers is vastly larger than the universe of writers , '' he said . mr lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with ask 's my jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links . `` search engines are about discovering information for the first time and rss is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites , '' he said . it would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that ask jeeves operates . there would be no instant sweeping changes to bloglines , said mr lanzone . `` our intent is to take our time to figure out the right business model not to try to monetise it right away , '' he said . though mr lanzone added that ask jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology . `` being able to search the blogosphere as one corpus of information will be very useful in its own right , '' said mr lanzone . rumours about the acquisition were broken by the napsterization weblog which said it got the hint from ask jeeves insiders .
