everton 's weir cools euro hopes everton defender david weir has played down talk of european football , despite his team lying in second place in the premiership after beating liverpool . weir told bbc radio five live : `` we do n't want to rest on our laurels and say we have achieved anything yet . `` i think you start taking your eye off the ball if you make statements and look too far into the future . `` if you start making predictions you soon fall back into trouble . the only thing that matters is the next game . '' he said : `` we are looking after each other and hard work goes a long way in this league . we have definitely shown that . `` also injuries and suspensions have n't cost us too badly and we have a lot of self-belief around the place .
