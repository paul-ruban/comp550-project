wada will appeal against ruling the world anti-doping agency ( wada ) will appeal against the acquittal of kostas kenteris and katerina thanou on doping charges , if the iaaf does not . the pair were cleared of charges relating to missing dope tests by the greek athletics federation last week . wada chairman dick pound said : `` i am convinced the iaaf will appeal against the decision , and we will support them . `` but if they accept the federation 's ruling we will go before the court of arbitration for sport , '' he added . kenteris 's lawyer , gregory ioannidis , reacted angrily to pound 's comments . `` comments like these only help to embarrass the sporting governing bodies , create a hostage situation for the iaaf and strengthen our case further , '' he told bbc sport . kenteris , 31 , and thanou , 30 , had been charged with avoiding drugs tests in tel aviv , chicago and athens and failing to notify anti-doping officials of their whereabouts before the olympics . they withdrew from the athens games after missing a drugs test at the olympic village on 12 august . but an independent tribunal ruled that the duo had not been informed that they needed to attend a drugs test in athens . however , their former coach christos tzekos was banned for four years by the tribunal . kenteris and thanou still have to face trial on charges brought separately by greek prosecutors of missing the drugs tests and faking a motorcycle accident to avoid testing at the athens games .
