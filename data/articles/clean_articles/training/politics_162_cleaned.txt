protect whistleblowers , tuc says the government should change the law to give more protection to employees who raise health and safety concerns about their workplaces , the tuc has said . it said data from employment tribunals suggested 1,500 `` safety whistleblowers '' had lost their jobs since 1999 . some firms found it cheaper to sack a worker than to improve buildings or change working conditions , it said . the health and safety executive said it was trying to get workers more involved in helping to make workplaces safer . the tuc figures were drawn from unfair dismissal cases at tribunals were health and safety were the main issue . safety representatives were often ignored when raising concerns because there was no legal duty to respond , claimed the union organisation . general secretary brendan barber said : `` it should n't be a firing offence to object to unsafe work . `` workers should not be placed in the situation where they are forced to choose between risking their job or risking their personal health and safety . '' mr barber , who said the `` problem is far worse than official statistics show '' , called for a legal system that `` protects safety whistleblowers '' . he added that workers who are not in a union , as well as casual and migrant workers , `` stand little chance of redress . '' rory o ' neill , editor of union-backed hazards magazine , which conducted the research , said : `` giving union safety reps more rights in more workplaces is the ultimate win-win . `` death and injuries at work increased last year , for the second time since the turn of the century . `` it would be a fatal mistake not to take full advantage of the union safety effect . '' the tuc has called on the government to appoint `` roving '' safety reps and to increase spending on health and safety work inspections . the health and safety executive had said that it had launched an initiative to make factories and offices safer , with more worker involvement .
