china keeps tight rein on credit china 's efforts to stop the economy from overheating by clamping down on credit will continue into 2005 , state media report . the curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices . there were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system . growth in china remains at a breakneck 9.1 % , and corporate investment is growing at more than 25 % a year . the breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9 % for more than a year . rapid tooling-up of china 's manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year . in theory , the government has a 7 % growth target , but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a `` hard landing '' in the shape of an overbalancing economy . a low exchange rate - china 's yuan is pegged to a rate of 8.28 to the dollar , which seems to be in relentless decline - means chinese exports are cheap on world markets . china has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of its peg . to some extent , the credit controls do seem to be taking effect . industrial output grew 15.7 % in the year to october , down from 23 % in february , and inflation slowed to 4.3 % - although retail sales are still booming .
