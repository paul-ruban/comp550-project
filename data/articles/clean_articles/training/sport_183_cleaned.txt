mourinho expects fight to finish chelsea manager jose mourinho expects the champions league clash with barcelona to be a fight to the finish . mourinho is relishing the first leg of the tie against his former club in the last 16 in the nou camp . he said : `` i would n't be surprised if nothing had been decided by the last minute of the return leg and the match had to go into extra time . `` i have to defend what is mine and the champions league is mine at the moment . i 'm the last manager to have won it . '' mourinho never coached barcelona , assisting both sir bobby robson and louis van gaal . but he is not envious , insisting : `` i do n't have to be jealous about barcelona because they have 100 years of history and have won the european cup once . `` i have been managing for five years and i have the same amount of champions league trophies to my name . '' barcelona star ronaldinho admitted : `` i think that it is going to be a difficult match for us because chelsea have a good team full of big stars . `` i have seen chelsea a few times on television , tactically they are very good and they are very strong on the counter-attack . `` they pressure very well and keep possession of the ball so it will be important that we play our own game . `` i believe they are the two strongest teams in europe . nevertheless , barcelona are accustomed to playing big games at the nou camp , where they have to face the likes of real madrid each season . `` it is a special game , the atmosphere in the city changes , there are lots of journalists but inside the dressing room there is not a lot of difference , '' ronaldinho added . `` we are only thinking of winning the match with all respect to the opposition .
