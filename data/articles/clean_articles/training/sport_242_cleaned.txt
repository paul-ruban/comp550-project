wenger rules out new keeper arsenal boss arsene wenger says he has no plans to sign a new goalkeeper during the january transfer window . wenger has brought in manuel almunia for the last three games for the out-of-form jens lehmann - but the spaniard himself has been prone to mistakes . there have been suggestions that wenger will swoop for a high-quality shot-stopper in the new year . but he told the evening standard : `` i do n't feel it will be necessary to bring in a new goalkeeper in january . '' the gunners manager refused to comment on the difficult start that 27-year-old almunia has made to his career at highbury . and he would not be drawn on whether lehmann would return for the top-of-the table clash with chelsea on sunday . almunia was at fault for rosenborg 's goal in arsenal 's 5-1 champions league win on tuesday and had some hairy moments in last week 's win over birmingham . but wenger said earlier this week that his indifferent form was down to pressure caused by being under scrutiny from the media . `` the debate has gone on too long . everyone has an opinion and i do not have to add to it , '' wenger added . arsenal have been linked with middlesbrough keeper mark schwarzer , fulham 's edwin van der sar and parma 's sebastien frey . and wenger has no immediate plans to recall former england under-21 international stuart taylor from his loan spell at leicester .
