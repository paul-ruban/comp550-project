deutsche boerse set to 'woo ' lse bosses of deutsche boerse and the london stock exchange are to meet amid talk that a takeover bid for the lse will be raised to â£1.5bn ( $ 2.9bn ) . last month , the german exchange tabled a 530 pence-per-share offer for lse , valuing it at â£1.3bn . paris-based euronext , owner of liffe in london , has also said it is interested in bidding for lse . euronext is due to hold talks with lse this week and it is reported to be ready to raise â£1.4bn to fund a bid . euronext chief jean-francois theodore is scheduled to meet his lse counterpart clara furse on friday . deutsche boerse chief werner seifert is meeting ms furse on thursday , in the third meeting between the two exchanges since the bid approach in december . the lse rejected deutsche boerse 's proposed â£1.3bn offer in december , saying it undervalued the business . but it agreed to leave the door open for talks to find out whether a `` significantly-improved proposal '' would be in the interests of lse 's shareholders and customers . in the meantime , euronext , which combines the paris , amsterdam and lisbon stock exchanges , also began talks with the lse . in a statement on thursday , euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash , but added that : `` there can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made . '' a deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in europe and the second biggest in the world after the new york stock exchange . according to the ft , in its latest meeting deutsche boerse will adopt a charm offensive to woo the london exchange . the newspaper said the german suitor will offer to manage a combined cash and equities market out of london and let ms furse take the helm . other reports this week said the deutsche boerse might even consider selling its luxembourg-based clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities transactions . its ownership of clearstream was seen as the main stumbling block to a london-frankfurt merger . lse shareholders feared a deutsche boerse takeover would force them to use clearstream , making it difficult for them to negotiate for lower transaction fees .
