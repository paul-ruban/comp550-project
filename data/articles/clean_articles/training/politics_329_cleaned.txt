tory expert denies defeat warning the conservatives ' campaign director has denied a report claiming he warned michael howard the party could not win the next general election . the times on monday said australian lynton crosby told the party leader to focus on trying to increase the tories ' commons presence by 25 to 30 seats . but mr crosby said in a statement : `` i have never had any such conversation ... and i do not hold that view . '' mr howard later added there was not `` one iota '' of truth in the report . the strategist helped australia 's pm , john howard , win four elections . mr howard appointed mr crosby as his elections chief last october . mr crosby 's statement said : `` the conservative party has been making an impact on the issues of lower tax and controlled immigration over the past week . '' it added : `` the labour party will be wanting to do all they can to distract attention away from the issues that really matter to people . ''
