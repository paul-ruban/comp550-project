harinordoquy suffers france axe number eight imanol harinordoquy has been dropped from france 's squad for the six nations match with ireland in dublin on 12 march . harinordoquy was a second-half replacement in last saturday 's 24-18 defeat to wales . bourgoin lock pascal pape , who has recovered from a sprained ankle , returns to the 22-man squad . wing cedric heymans and ludovic valbon come in for aurelien rougerie and jean-philippe grandclaude . rougerie hurt his chest against wales while grandclaude was a second-half replacement against both england and wales . valbon , capped in last june 's tests against the united states and canada , was a second half replacement in the win over scotland . france coach bernard laporte said harinordoquy had been axed after a poor display last weekend . `` imanol has been dropped from the squad because the least i can say is that he did n't make a thundering comeback against wales , '' said laporte . `` we know the ireland game will be fast and rough and we also want to be able to replace both locks during the game if needed , and gregory lamboley can also come on at number seven or eight . `` the grand slam is gone but we 'll go to ireland to win . `` it will be a very exciting game because ireland have three wins under their belt , have just defeated england and have their eyes set on a grand slam . '' france , who lost to wales last week , must defeat the irish to keep alive their hopes of retaining the six nations trophy . ireland are unbeaten in this year 's tournament and have their sights set on a first grand slam since 1948 . dimitri yachvili ( biarritz ) , pierre mignoni ( clermont ) , yann delaigue ( castres ) , frederic michalak ( stade toulousain ) , damien traille ( biarritz ) , yannick jauzion ( stade toulousain ) , ludovic valbon ( biarritz ) , christophe dominici ( stade francais ) , cedric heymans ( stade toulousain ) , julien laharrague ( brive ) sylvain marconnet ( stade francais ) , nicolas mas ( perpignan ) , olivier milloud ( bourgoin ) , sebastien bruno ( sale/eng ) , william servat ( stade toulousain ) , fabien pelous ( stade toulousain , capt ) , jerome thion ( biarritz ) , pascal pap & # 233 ; ( bourgoin ) , gregory lamboley ( stade toulousain ) , serge betsen ( biarritz ) , julien bonnaire ( bourgoin ) , yannick nyanga ( b & # 233 ; ziers )
