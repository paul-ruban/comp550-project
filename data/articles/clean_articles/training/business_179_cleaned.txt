irish duo could block man utd bid irishmen jp mcmanus and john magnier , who own a 29 % stake in manchester united , will reportedly reject any formal â£800m offer for the club . the sunday times and the sunday telegraph say they will oppose any formal â£800m takeover bid from us tycoon malcom glazer . mr glazer got permission to look at the club 's accounts last week . irish billionaires mr mcmanus and mr magnier are said to believe that an â£800m bid undervalues club prospects . mr magnier and mr mcmanus , who hold their stake through their cubic expression investment vehicle have the power to block a bid . mr glazer 's financial backers , including jp morgan , the us investment bank have said they wo n't back a bid unless it receives backing from the owners of at least 75 % of the club 's shares . however , there has been much speculation that the irish duo simply do not think the price offered - 300p a share - is high enough . mr glazer has been stalking the premier league football club since 2003 . mr magnier and mr mcmanus issued a statement late on friday saying that they remained `` long-term investors '' in man utd . the sunday telegraph says the board of manchester united also considered a management buyout at just over 300p but did not go ahead with it .
