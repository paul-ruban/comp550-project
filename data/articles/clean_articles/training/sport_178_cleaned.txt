cole refuses to blame van persie ashley cole has refused to blame robin van persie for leaving arsenal with no fully-fit strikers for the fa cup fifth round replay at sheffield united . van persie is suspended alongside dennis bergkamp and jose antonio reyes after being sent off at southampton when arsenal had a numerical advantage . thierry henry is ruled out with an achilles tendon injury but cole said : `` no-one is putting the blame on robin . `` it 's just something that happens on the spur of the moment . '' cole added : `` i 've done it before and i hope they did n't blame me for anything . `` of course he 'll learn . i 've been sent off a couple of times now and it 's just one of those things when you go a bit crazy for one or two seconds . freddie ljungberg is likely to be used in an emergency striking role and will be partnered by either arturo lupoli , quincy owusu-abeyie or jeremie aliadiere . gunners boss arsene wenger said : `` freddie is an option but we need a second striker . `` i have to decide whether it will be aliadiere , quincy or lupoli who will start with him up front . those three will be involved . '' arsenal are also without winger robert pires , who sustained an ankle injury at st mary 's . wenger added : `` it does n't look like anything is fractured , but it is a good ankle sprain . `` it does not look like pires will be ready for two to three weeks .
