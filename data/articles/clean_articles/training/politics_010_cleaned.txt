crucial decision on super-casinos a decision on whether to allow westminster to legislate on super-casinos is set to be made by the scottish parliament . the government has plans for up to eight las vegas style resorts in the uk , one of which is likely to be in glasgow . scottish ministers insist they will still have the final say on whether a super-casino will be built in scotland . but opposition parties say that will not happen in practice . the vote is due to be taken on wednesday and is expected to be close . the scottish executive believes that the legislation should be handled by westminster . the new law will control internet gambling for the first time and is aimed at preventing children from becoming involved . a super-casino in glasgow could be located at ibrox or the scottish exhibition and conference centre . the new gambling bill going through westminster will allow casino complexes to open to the public , have live entertainment and large numbers of fruit machines with unlimited prizes . but the scottish national party and the tories say the issue of super-casinos should be decided in scotland and believe the executive is shirking its responsibility .
