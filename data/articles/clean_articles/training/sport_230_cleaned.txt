hitzlsperger waiting on o'leary aston villa 's thomas hitzlsperger is waiting to learn the future of manager david o'leary before committing himself to a new contract with the club . o'leary has been in talks over a new deal and he said : `` i had a message from thomas ' agent asking me what the news was on myself . `` he wants to find out before he goes into discussions over thomas . `` the reason thomas is not speaking to the club is because the agent wants to see the outcome of what happens to me . '' hitzlsperger 's current deal expires in the summer and he has been offered a new deal by the midlands club . the german international is understood to be keen to remain at villa , despite interest in his native country from hamburg . but he wants assurances that o'leary will also be committing himself long-term because negotiations over a new three-and-a-half-year contract appear to have stalled . o'leary wants his backroom staff - assistant manager roy aitken and fitness coach steve mcgregor - to also be given satisfactory deals , which will tie them to villa until the summer of 2008 .
