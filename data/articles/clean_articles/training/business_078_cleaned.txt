deadline nears for fiat-gm deal fiat and general motors ( gm ) have until midnight on 1 february to settle a disagreement over a potential takeover . the deadline marks the point at which fiat will gain the right to sell its car division to gm , part of an alliance agreed in 2000 . gm , whose own european operations are losing money , no longer wants to own the unprofitable fiat unit . reports of deadlocked talks sent fiat shares down 1.2 % on tuesday , after monday 's 4 % gain on hopes of a payoff . the us firm is thought to be offering about $ 2bn ( â£1.06bn ) to extricate itself from the arrangement . it has argued the deal was voided by fiat 's decision to sell off fiat 's finance arm and halve gm 's stake via a capital-raising effort . the 2000 deal resulted from a race between gm and daimlerchrysler to ally with fiat . the german firm wanted to buy fiat outright . but gianni agnelli , the godfather of the group , wanted to keep control , and preferred gm 's offer to buy a 20 % stake and give fiat the right to sell in the future , known as a `` put option '' . since then , however , fiat cars have lost market share and the firm has piled up losses , while a plan to raise new money in 2003 cut gm 's stake in half to 10 % . for its part , gm 's european units opel and saab have both had trouble , with opel management threatening to cut 12,000 jobs . `` the last thing they need is additional production capacity in europe , '' said patrick juchemich , auto analyst at sal oppenheim bank .
