moreno debut makes oscar mark catalina sandino moreno has joined a rare group of actresses who have been nominated for an oscar for starring in a foreign language film . the colombian-born actress was the final hope for director joshua marston , who scoured the us and colombia for a lead for maria full of grace . the film sees the 23-year-old play a teenage drug mule who smuggles heroin by swallowing pellets in condoms . plaudits have been raining down on her for her gritty performance , making it all the more surprising that this is her first film . her previous acting experience was in amateur productions in her home city of bogota at the ruben di pietro theatre academy . she has already received a nomination for the independent spirit awards leading actress category but these rarely overlap with academy awards , instead recognising quirkier , low-budget films . and at the 2004 berlin film festival the jury could not choose between her and charlize theron 's oscar winning performance in monster so gave them a tied award . sandino moreno is now being regarded as one of the most promising actresses around at the moment . but she is taking her time committing to her next project , hoping to land a strong spanish script and would love to be able to work with directors pedro almodovar or alejandro amenabar .
