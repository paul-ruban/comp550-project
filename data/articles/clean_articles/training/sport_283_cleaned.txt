tv calls after carroll error spurs boss martin jol said his team were `` robbed '' at manchester united after pedro mendes ' shot clearly crossed the line but was not given . `` the referee is already wearing an earpiece so why ca n't we just stop the game and get the decision right , '' said jol after the 0-0 draw . `` but at the end of the day it 's so obvious that pedro 's shot was over the line it 's incredible . `` we feel robbed but it 's difficult for the linesman and referee to see it . '' mendes shot from 50 yards and united goalkeeper roy carroll spilled the ball into his own net before hooking it clear . jol added : `` we are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line , it was a metre inside the goal . `` what really annoys me is that we are here in 2005 , watching something on a tv monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee is n't told about it . `` we did n't play particularly well but i am pleased - even now - with a point , although we should have had three . '' mendes could not believe the 'goal ' was not given after seeing a replay . he said : `` my reaction on the pitch was to celebrate . `` it was a very nice goal , it was clearly over the line - i 've never seen one so over the line and not given in my career . `` it 's really , really over . what can you do but laugh about it ? it 's a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it did n't count . `` it 's not every game you score from the halfway line . '' manchester united manager sir alex ferguson sympathised with tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology . `` i think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that 's that technology should play a part in the game , '' ferguson told mutv . `` what i was against originally was the time factor in video replays . `` but i read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee ca n't make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on . `` thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a free-kick or take a corner or a goal-kick . so you would n't be wasting a lot of time . `` i think you could start off by using it for goal-line decisions . i think that would be an opening into a new area of football . '' arsenal boss arsene wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology . `` when the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at old trafford , that just reinforces what i feel - there should be video evidence , '' said wenger . `` it 's a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal .
