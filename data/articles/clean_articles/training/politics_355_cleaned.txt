lib dems stress budget trust gap public trust in the handling of the economy can only be restored if gordon brown opens up his books for unbiased inspection , say the lib dems . city experts say there is a â£10bn `` black hole '' in the public finances , a claim denied by the chancellor . lib dem spokesman vince cable said the public did not know who to believe and the national audit office should judge . responding to the pre-budget report , mr cable also attacked labour 's `` unfair '' and over-complicated taxes . in his report , mr brown insisted he was on course to meet his `` golden rule '' of borrowing only to invest , rather than for day-to-day spending , over the course of the economic cycle . mr cable said people did not know whether to believe the chancellor or the consensus among experts which said the rule would be broken . `` there is an issue of credibility and trust , '' he said . `` we can not have a continuation of a situation where the chancellor sets his own tests and then marks them . `` what we need is the equivalent of a thorough ofsted inspection of the government 's accounts . '' he asked what the government had to hide . mr cable also accused the chancellor of ducking tough choices . he argued : `` there are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the uk housing market and rising personal debt . but they have not been confronted . '' mr brown confirmed he was setting aside another â£520m for the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan . mr cable compared that new cost with the â£500m needed for britain 's role in the entire first gulf war - when 80 % of the bill had been met through help from european and arab nations . he suggested keeping british troops in iraq could cost another â£1bn with the government also planning to spend at least â£3bn for identity cards . the current economic climate meant britain could not afford the `` reckless , george bush-style tax cutting spree '' planned by the tories , he said . instead , what was needed was simple and fair taxation rather than the `` complete mess '' produced by mr brown 's endless tinkering . mr cable said 40 % of all pensioners were now paying marginal tax rates of 50 % . and one-and-a-half million hard working families were paying 60 % marginal tax rates . with that record , he asked why ministers attacked lib dem plans for a new 50 % tax rate for the `` very rich '' - those earning more than â£100,000 a year . mr brown earmarked â£1bn to help keep down council tax rises next year . but the lib dem spokesman questioned whether that money was being found from cuts to education and health . he urged the government to scrap the `` grossly unfair '' tax completely . the lib dems want it replaced with a local income tax . in response , mr brown stressed the iraq money came from a reserve funds . it was because he had rejected previous lib dem proposals , such as scrapping the new deal , that britain 's economy was successful , claimed mr brown .
