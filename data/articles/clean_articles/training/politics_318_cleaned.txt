labour in constituency race row labour 's choice of a white candidate for one of the uk 's most multi-racial seats proves the need for all-black short lists , says a race group . local councillor lyn brown was selected for west ham , east london , in a contest between two white and five ethnic minority women . an operation black vote spokesman said they now wanted to meet labour party chairman ian mccartney for discussions . mr mccartney recently announced party consultation on all-black shortlists . however , labour has so far unable been unable to comment on the implications of the west ham result . ashok vishwanathan of operation black vote , which aims to increase ethnic minorities ' participation in the political process and their representation , said the result again showed all-women shortlists were not effective in getting minority women selected . `` i think all-black shortlists are the only way to cut to the chase and address the lack of minority candidates , '' mr vishwanathan said . last month the chairman of the commission for racial equality ( cre ) also called for ethnic minority shortlists in certain circumstances . a cre spokesman said the organisation had nothing to add on the shortlist issue specifically but would be working with all the political parties to address the under-representation of ethnic minorities in parliament . `` we will be raising it with each of the party leaders on a formal basis and helping them find the most appropriate way forward , '' the spokesman said . ethnic minorities make up 8 % of the united kingdom population but only 2 % of mps - 13 out of 659 - are from a visible minority group . twelve of them represent labour , and one is a liberal democrat . if ethnic minorities were represented in the house of commons in proportion to their numbers in the population , there would be 42 ethnic minority mps .
