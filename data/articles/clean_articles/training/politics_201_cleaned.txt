howard rejects bnp 's claim tory leader michael howard has dismissed claims that his immigration policy was `` moving onto the turf '' of the british national party ( bnp ) . bnp leader nick griffin told the independent he expected some bnp voters to switch to the tories over the issue . but mr howard said he rejected the idea that the tories and bnp appealed to the same voting instincts . asked if he would welcome bnp voters he told the bbc : `` i do n't want anybody to vote for these extremist parties '' . he added , on bbc radio 4 's today programme : `` if you want good community relations in this country ... then you have to have firm , fair immigration controls . '' the tories have promised an upper limit on the number of people allowed into britain with the slogan : `` it 's not racist to impose limits on immigration '' . all parties are stepping up campaiging in the run-up to the general election , widely expected to be called for 5 may . labour has unveiled its own `` points system '' for ensuring migrants who want to work in the uk have skills that are required , but have rejected immigration quotas . the liberal democrats have warned both parties against `` pandering to prejudice '' . mr griffin told the independent the tories ' plans were `` a definite move onto our turf '' . he said : `` i quite freely accept that on a nationwide basis , the tories will con enough people to make a significant hole in our vote . '' asked whether he was comfortable with the perception that the conservatives and the bnp appeal to the same voting instincts , mr howard told the bbc : `` i reject that entirely '' . he said he found bnp 's policies `` abhorrent '' but he said the uk had to take a different approach to immigration , which he said was out of control . `` the government does n't want to limit it in any way , we do , there 's a legitimate difference between us there which we can discuss in a calm , rational and reasonable way , '' he said . he again rejected newspaper speculation that his own father entered britain illegally .
