india 's reliance family feud heats up the ongoing public spat between the two heirs of india 's biggest conglomerate , reliance group , has spilled over to the board meeting of a leading company within the group . anil ambani , vice-chairman of india petrochemicals limited ( ipcl ) , stayed away from a gathering of senior managers on thursday . the move follows a decision earlier this month by anil - the younger brother of reliance group president mukesh ambani - to resign from his post . his resignation was not accepted by his brother , who is also the boss of ipcl . the ipcl board met in mumbai to discuss the company 's results for the october-to-december quarter . it is understood that the board also considered anil 's resignation and asked him to reconsider his decision . however , anil 's demand that anand jain - another ipcl board member accused by anil of creating a rift in the ambani family - be thrown out , was not met . anil has accused anand jain , a confidant of his brother mukesh , of playing a negative role in the ambani family , and being responsible for the trouble between the brothers . on wednesday , the board of reliance energy , another reliance group company , reaffirmed its faith in anil , who is the company 's chief . reliance group acquired the government 's 26 % stake in ipcl - india 's second-largest petrochemicals company - in 2002 , as part of the privatisation drive . meanwhile , the group 's flagship company , reliance industries , has its board meeting on friday to consider its financial results . mukesh is the company 's chairman and anil its deputy , and it is expected that both brothers will come face to face in the meeting . the ambani family controls 48 % of the group , which is worth $ 17bn ( â£9.1bn ; 745bn indian rupees ) . it was founded by their father , dhiru bhai ambani , who died two years ago .
