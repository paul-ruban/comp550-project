rovers reject third ferguson bid blackburn have rejected a third bid from rangers for scotland captain barry ferguson , bbc sport has learnt . it is thought blackburn want â£6m for the midfielder but chief executive john williams has confirmed the club are still `` in dialogue '' with rangers . the 26-year-old has already handed in a transfer request at ewood park as he seeks a return to ibrox . but the clubs have been unable to reach agreement over a fee for ferguson , who moved to lancashire in 2003 for â£6.5m . on thursday rangers said they would not be increasing their offer of â£4m . blackburn have said all along that they want â£6m for the midfielder and williams has rejected proposals from rangers over a player-swap deal . williams said : `` we are in dialogue with glasgow rangers but we have no agreement . '' the negotiations will have to be concluded by midnight on monday , when the winter transfer window shuts . williams conceded any deal for ferguson was looking `` unlikely '' before the close of the transfer window but rangers still had a chance to seal the deal . `` we have no comment to make other than we have not got an agreement with glasgow rangers , '' he added . `` the way things are looking , i think it is unlikely we are going to . `` the ball is in their court but we have not got an offer that is acceptable at this moment . '' it is understood that blackburn accepted a â£5m offer for ferguson from everton at the weekend . but the player is determined to return to scotland and rejected a move to goodison park . ferguson did not play in the fa cup win over colchester on saturday despite recovering from a groin injury with rovers boss mark hughes claiming it had been an `` emotional and difficult time '' for the player .
