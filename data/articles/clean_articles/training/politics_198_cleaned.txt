police chief backs drinking move a chief constable has backed the introduction of 24-drinking , saying police had a responsibility to ensure people could benefit from a law change . however , norfolk police chief andy hayman also warned that a great deal of preparatory work was still needed . `` i do n't subscribe to the views of some of my colleagues who are coming out and objecting to it , '' he said . his comments come after the liberal democrats backed tory demands that the government 's plans be put on hold . andy hayman said he did not agree with politicians and senior police officers who have objected to the plans , which come into force on 7 february . `` i feel that is a premature position to be taking , '' he said . among those who have criticised the plans are the uk 's top policeman sir john stevens . the metropolitan police chief said last week that the plans for 24-hour drinking should be re-examined because of a binge drinking `` epidemic '' . however , mr hayman said : `` it would be totally unacceptable in my view for a chief constable to say , ' i 'm very sorry ' . he said that police should make sure that responsible people who wanted a change could benefit from more liberal legislation . `` my view is that i have got a responsibility to create an environment where that can happen , `` he said . however , he believes a lot of preparatory work is still needed to be done by police , local authorities and the drinks industry before the nation was ready for 24-hour drinking . but he is confident problems in the early days can be `` ironed out '' . he believed the majority of people favoured this law change and `` we have to accept that lifestyles are changing '' . but aspects such as transport , and basic things such as making sure public toilets are open all night had to be taken into account . prime minister tony blair has defended the licensing act , saying it is wrong to deny people the relaxed hours enjoyed elsewhere in europe because of a `` tiny minority '' of violent binge drinkers . a six-month transitional period starts on 7 february during which time venues can apply for extended licences . the conservatives have called for 24-hour drinking to be shelved until the problems of binge drinking are solved . on monday , the lib dems also called for a delay . lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said : `` it would clearly be prudent to allow the police and local authorities more time to prepare for flexible drinking hours . '' chief constable mr hayman acknowledged that binge drinking did cause problems . `` if you come to norwich on a friday or saturday night you will see things going on that will you make you feel ashamed . `` however , i want industry to succeed in norwich and i want norwich to be the recognised nightspot of east anglia . `` there is no way i want to say we can not manage it or police it . we can .
