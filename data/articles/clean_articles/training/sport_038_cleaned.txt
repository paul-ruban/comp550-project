radcliffe proves doubters wrong this wo n't go down as one of the greatest marathons of paula 's career . but as a test of character , it was the toughest race she 's ever taken part in . a win in the new york marathon does n't make up for the disappointment of athens in any shape or form , but it will offer hope and reassurance for next year . if paula 's last experience of the year had been athens , it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism . she can now draw a line under this year and make plans about her future . even if she 'd lost this race , there would have been a lot of positives to take out of it . she knows she can dig deep if she needs to . it was a strong field , with a number of the girls going into the race with expectations of winning . and although two hours 23 minutes was n't one of paula 's best times , it was n't far off the record on a difficult course . i was speaking to paula in the lead-up to this race and she said that in many ways she was facing a no-win situation . she thought that if she won , people would say `` why could n't she do that in athens ? '' and if she lost , people would say her career was over . and a lot of people were wondering what would happen if paula was forced to drop out of this race , as she did in the marathon and 10,000m in athens . but that was never on the cards . she might have been beaten , but she would have kept running . the reasons she was forced to pull out in athens - the niggling injuries , her lack of energy and the oppressive conditions - were n't at play here . the only question was what position she could finish in . most important of all , despite all the hype in the media ahead of this race , there were never doubts in paula 's mind . if she was n't confident , she would n't have run . after all , if you 're the best in the world at an event , you 'll always have expectations of winning . now paula will take part in the run london 10km race in london at the end of the year , have a well-earned rest over christmas and go into next year with a lot of optimism .
