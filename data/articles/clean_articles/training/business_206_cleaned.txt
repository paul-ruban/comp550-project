standard life cuts policy bonuses standard life , europe 's largest mutual life insurer , has cut bonuses for with-profit policyholders . annual bonus rates on its with-profits life policies were cut from 2.5 % to 2 % , while bonuses on pension policies were reduced from 3.25 % to 2.5 % . it is the sixth time in three years standard life has made cuts to bonus rates , despite an 8.7 % rise in the value of the with-profits fund in 2004 . the insurer blamed the cuts on poor share returns and low interest rates . with-profits policies are designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs of stock market volatility . profits made in good years are kept in reserve to pay investors an annual bonus even when the stock market performs badly . slumping share prices throughout 2001 and 2002 forced most firms to trim bonus rates on their policies . standard life came in for criticism for sticking with stock market investments during 2001 and 2002 . the insurer argued that shares outperformed other investments over the long term and that policyholders would feel the benefit when the stock market recovered . recently , norwich union and axa sun life both cut their with-profit bonus rates . john gill , managing director of the insurer 's life and pensions division , said that a strong stock market recovery in the past two years had only `` partly compensated for losses during 2001 and 2002 '' . in addition , low interest rates meant that `` long-term investment returns are well below historic levels '' , mr gill added . however , mr gill maintained that with-profits continued to perform well over the long term . `` our payouts continue to stand up well against other types of long-term investments over similar periods , '' he said . standard life has an estimated 2.4 million with-profits policyholders . last year , the company announced that it was looking to float on the stock market in 2006 .
