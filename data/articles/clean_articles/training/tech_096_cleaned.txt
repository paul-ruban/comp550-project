california sets fines for spyware the makers of computer programs that secretly spy on what people do with their home pcs could face hefty fines in california . from 1 january , a new law is being introduced to protect computer users from software known as spyware . the legislation , which was approved by governor arnold schwarzenegger , is designed to safeguard people from hackers and help protect their personal information . spyware is considered by computer experts to be one of the biggest nuisance and security threats facing pc users in the coming year . the software buries itself in computers and can collect a wide range of information . at its worst , it has the ability to hijack personal data , like passwords , login details and credit card numbers . the programs are so sophisticated they change frequently and become impossible to eradicate . one form of spyware called adware has the ability to collect information on a computer user 's web-surfing . it can result in people being bombarded with pop-up ads that are hard to close . in washington , congress has been debating four anti-spyware bills , but california is a step ahead . the state 's consumer protection against spyware act bans the installation of software that takes control of another computer . it also requires companies and websites to disclose whether their systems will install spyware . consumers are able to seek up to $ 1,000 in damages if they think they have fallen victim to the intrusive software . the new law marks a continuing trend in california towards tougher privacy rights . a recent survey by earthlink and webroot found that 90 % of pcs are infested with the surreptitious software and that , on average , each one is harbouring 28 separate spyware programs . currently users wanting protection from spyware have turned to free programs such as spybot and ad-aware .
