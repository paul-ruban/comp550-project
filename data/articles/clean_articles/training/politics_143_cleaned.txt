malik rejects all-black mp lists a call for ethnic minority shortlists to boost the number of black and asian mps has been rejected by one of labour 's most senior asians . shahid malik , who is on labour 's ruling nec , accepted people 's frustration but said there should be targets not lists to boost representation of minorities . just 13 of britain 's 659 mps are from ethnic minority groups , he added . commission for racial equality chief trevor phillips argued on sunday the time had come for such shortlists . that came after it emerged that one of britain 's most ethnically diverse constituency , west ham , was to get a women-only shortlist for the next election following an nec ruling . mr phillips said changes to the race relations legislation might allow political parties to reserve seats for under-represented groups . for example in west ham , this might allow only women and minorities to seek to be candidates . `` if we get to the other side of the general election and find that minorities are not represented , we have to say that after 20 or 30 years of talking about this , we can not go on the same way , '' he said . he added : `` it would be terribly disappointing if in the least white constituency [ west ham ] in the whole of europe we did n't have a minority candidate . '' appearing on bbc radio 4 's today programme , mr malik , who is himself running for the seat of dewsbury , acknowledged that so far women-only shortlists had failed to deliver a boost in the number of ethnic minority candidates . but he argued : `` i do think that there currently things that parties can do and which they are n't doing ... for example setting targets to ensure that existing democratic structures are more reflective . '' labour mp diane abbot , who backs mr phillips ' proposal of shortlists , said she had been elected along with three other ethnic minority mps - keith vaz , paul boateng and bernie grant - in 1987 but it took another 10 years before another black woman was able to win a seat . that was a rate of progress ms abbott described as `` painful '' . `` i am a little older than shahid and served on the national executive committee in the 1990s - i was the first black person on the nec ... crossing our fingers and hoping we are going to get more black and asian mp has n't worked , '' she said . `` the shortlist strategy works for women and i believe that it can be made to work for black and asian people . '' on tuesday labour chairman ian mccartney said his party was `` ambitious '' to improve black and asian representation . `` we have n't ruled out all-black shortlists and welcome a debate in the party about this , '' he said .
