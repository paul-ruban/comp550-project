box office blow for alexander director oliver stone 's historical epic alexander has failed in its bid to conquer the box office , entering the us film charts at number six . the swords and sandals blockbuster , rumoured to have cost more than $ 150m ( â£79m ) to make , earned just $ 13.5 ( â£7m ) over three days at the us box office . due to the thanksgiving holiday , the film opened on wednesday , bringing its total takings to $ 21.6m ( â£11.4m ) . top of the box office for a second week was action movie national treasure . the family adventure , starring nicolas cage , took $ 33.1m ( â£17.m ) , ahead of animated comedy the incredibles - now in its fourth week in the charts - which took $ 24.1m ( â£12.7m ) . last week oliver stone 's film met with scathing reviews from us critics . the film stars irish actor colin farrell as one of history 's most celebrated leaders - a relentless and arrogant warrior who conquered much of the known world by the age of 25 . in particular , its portrayal of alexander as a bisexual has met with a hostile reception and the threat of legal action from greek lawyers . `` though the battles have the blood-and-sinew bravado you expect from oliver stone , this three-hour buttnumbathon is hamstrung by a hectoring grandiosity , '' wrote one reviewer in rolling stone magazine . others poured scorn on farrell 's bleached hair and angelina jolie 's unwieldy accent , which variety called `` a combination of mata hari and count dracula '' . but novelist gore vidal defended the film , saying it was `` barrier-breaking '' for its frank depiction of bisexuality . in sweden last thursday , to pick up a lifetime achievement award at the stockholm international film festival , stone expressed the hope that alexander might be better appreciated in europe . `` one of the reasons i am being honoured here is europeans tend to see me a little differently than they do in the us , '' said the director behind jfk , platoon and born on the fourth of july . he added alexander `` was not an easy movie , but then i 've never made easy movies '' .
