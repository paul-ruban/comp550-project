pearce keen on succeeding keegan joint assistant boss stuart pearce has admitted he would like to succeed kevin keegan as manager at manchester city . keegan has decided to step down as city manager when his contract comes to an end in 18 months . `` you do n't have to be einstein to realise there will be a manager 's job available at a really good club , '' pearce told bbc gmr . `` i will certainly be applying for it , although whether the board deem me good enough to take it , i do not know . '' pearce initially joined city as a player under keegan in 2001 before becoming part of the coaching staff . he was promoted to joint assistant-manager following the departure of arthur cox last summer . the former england defender had a year as player-boss with nottingham forest eight seasons ago but has made no secret of his desire to have another crack at the job . he was linked with the manager 's job at oldham and keegan has stated he would not get in the way if pearce wanted to leave . but it now appears pearce is keen to wait for his chance at city . he added : `` by that time , i will have been here for five years so at least they will have had a good look at me and they are aware of my feelings with regard to being kevin 's successor . `` obviously , the issue is out of my hands but it is a fantastic job for anybody - i just hope it will be me .
