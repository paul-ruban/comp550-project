pandas benefit from wireless net the world 's dwindling panda population is getting a helping hand from a wireless internet network . the wolong nature reserve in the sichuan province of southwest china is home to 20 % of the remaining 1,500 giant pandas in the world . a broadband and wireless network installed on the reserve has allowed staff to chronicle the pandas ' daily activities . the data and images can be shared with colleagues around the world . the reserve conducts vital research on both panda breeding and bamboo ecology . using the network , vets have been able to observe how infant pandas feed and suggest changes to improve the tiny cubs ' chances of survival . `` digital technology has transformed the way we communicate and share information inside wolong and with the rest of the world , '' said zhang hemin , director of the wolong nature reserve . `` our researchers now have state-of-the-art digital technology to help foster the panda population and manage our precious surroundings . '' the network has been developed by intel , working closely with the staff at wolong . it includes a 802.11b wireless network and a video monitoring system using five cameras to observe pandas around the clock . before the new infrastructure arrived at the panda park , staff walked or drove to deliver floppy disks across the reserve . infant panda health was recorded on paper notebooks and research teams in the field had little access to the data . to foster cultural links across the globe , a children 's learning lab has been incorporated in the network , in collaboration with globio ( federation for global biodiversity education for children ) , an international non-profit organisation . it will enable children at local primary schools to hook up with their peers in portland , oregon in the us . `` digital technology brings this story to life by enabling a global dialogue to help bridge cultures around the world , '' said globio founder gerry ellis .
