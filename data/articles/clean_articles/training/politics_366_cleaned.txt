brown calls for â£5.5bn aids fund gordon brown has called on rich nations to fund a â£5.5bn ( $ 10bn ) plan to fight the aids epidemic and find a vaccine . on the fourth day of his six-day tour of africa , the uk chancellor predicted a vaccine could be found by 2012 if the world stepped up its funding pledges . doubling the â£400m being spent yearly on finding such a vaccine could advance it by three years and save six million lives , mr brown said on thursday . he hopes to use the uk 's g8 presidency to push the issue forward . `` i believe that the generation that provided the finance to combat , cure and eradicate the world 's deadliest disease of today - and today the world 's least curable disease - hiv/aids - will rightly earn the title 'the great generation ' , '' mr brown said in a speech during his african tour . the problems of hiv/aids were inseparable from poverty , he added . `` at least $ 10 billion per annum ( â£5.5bn ) is needed to address the hiv/aids crisis in low and middle income countries . `` existing financial commitments on their own will not stop the pandemic . `` the uk 's proposal for an international finance facility is so important - increasing world aid flows by over $ 50 billion ( â£27bn ) . a doubling of world aid to halve world poverty . '' mr brown also said he had agreed with the italian finance minister domenico siniscalco to push forward with plans for the world-wide sharing and co-ordination of research into the disease . currently the private sector was only spending â£60m a year on seeking an inoculation and the market needed boosting , mr brown said . he called on industrialised nations to commit themselves to buying the first 300m vaccines at a cost of $ 20 each , thereby boosting the market for inoculations . this would be a `` large enough inducement to create much stronger interest from both large and small pharmaceutical firms '' , mr brown added . more must also be done to finance the treatment and care of those living with hiv/aids and their families , he said . but aid charity actionaid criticised mr brown 's preoccupation with finding a vaccine and called on g8 nations to fund hiv/aids treatments . the charity 's head of hiv/aids in britain , simon wright said : `` while encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to discover an hiv vaccine is important , a failure to provide any funding for hiv treatments condemns a generation of people to death . `` hiv is decimating african countries , killing the most productive adults who should be working , caring for children and building the economy . an hiv vaccine is probably at least 10 years away . treatments are needed now . '' on wednesday , mr brown visited slums in the kenyan capital nairobi . he will visit an hiv/aids orphanage in tanzania and a women 's credit union in mozambique before chairing a meeting of the commission for africa in cape town . the chancellor has already unveiled proposals for a g8 aid package which he has likened to the marshall plan used by the united states to rebuild europe after world war two .
