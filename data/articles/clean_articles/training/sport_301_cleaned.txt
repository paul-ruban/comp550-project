o'sullivan quick to hail italians ireland coach eddie o'sullivan heaped praise on italy after seeing his side stutter to a 28-17 victory in rome . `` it was a hell of a tough game , '' said o'sullivan . `` we struggled in the first half because we had n't the football . `` italy played really well . they handled the ball well in terms of kicking it , if that 's not an oxymoron . `` we said before the game that it might take until 10 minutes from the end for this game to be won , and that 's how it turned out . '' ireland struggled to cope with italy 's fierce start and were indebted to skipper brian o'driscoll , who set up tries for geordan murphy and peter stringer . `` we had our first attack in the italian half after 22 minutes , '' said o'sullivan . `` we had a good return , with three first-half possessions in their half and we scored twice . `` the second half was about spending more time in their half . '' scrum-half peter stringer was also glad that ireland escaped wtih a victory . `` all credit to them , '' he told bbc sport . `` we knew it would be tough coming to rome . they always give us a tough game here and they showed a lot of spirit . `` they had a lot of ball in the first half but we got a few scores when we got into their 22 .
