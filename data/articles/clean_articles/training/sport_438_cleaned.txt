davenport hits out at wimbledon world number one lindsay davenport has criticised wimbledon over the issue of equal prize money for women . reacting to a disputed comment by all england club chairman tim phillips , the american said : `` i think it is highly insulting if prize money is taken away . `` somebody , i think it was mr phillips , said they wo n't have money for flowers at wimbledon . that 's insulting . '' an all england club spokesperson denied phillips made the remark , insisting : `` he definitely did n't say it . '' the statement added : `` it was said by someone else and was a humorous aside at the end of a radio interview when the conversation had moved to talking about the wimbledon grounds . '' davenport was speaking following the announcement that this week 's dubai duty free event will join the us and australian opens in offering equal prize money for women . `` you hear about women playing only three sets while men play five , '' said daveport . `` and the best women are never going to beat the best men . `` but it 's a different game you go to watch with the women - it does n't make it better or worse . `` hopefully we will be able to change people 's minds . '' serena williams , who is also in dubai , added : `` i 'm obviously for equal prize money . `` women 's tennis is exciting . men 's tennis is exciting as well , but the women have it right now . `` if you are bringing in the spectators you should be able to reap what everyone else is able to reap .
