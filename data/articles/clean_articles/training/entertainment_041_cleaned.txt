no ads for passion oscar campaign producer mel gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote the passion of the christ to voters in next year 's academy awards . gibson and his icon productions partner bruce davey said they would not be campaigning in print , radio or tv for success at the oscars in february . `` this film should be judged on its artistic merit , not who spends more money on advertising , '' davey said . but dvds will be sent to oscar voters , who will be invited to screenings . icon spent very little on advertising the film , which deals with the last hours of jesus christ 's life , when it was released earlier this year - instead , it made the film available for special screenings at churches . it went on to gross over $ 600m ( â£322m ) in ticket sales worldwide . over recent years , marketing films to the members of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry . last year , the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios . academy president frank pierson praised gibson 's move for working to restore the oscars as a `` celebration and appreciation of excellence , '' and resisting the `` crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award '' .
