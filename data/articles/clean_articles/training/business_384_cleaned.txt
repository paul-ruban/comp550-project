weak end-of-year sales hit next next has said its annual profit will be â£5m lower than previously expected because its end-of-year clearance sale has proved disappointing . `` clearance rates in our end-of-season sale have been below our expectations , '' the company said . the high street retailer said it now expected to report annual profits of between â£415m and â£425m ( $ 779m-798m ) . next 's shares fell more than 3 % following the release of the trading statement . next chief executive simon wolfson admitted that festive sales were `` below where we would expect a normal christmas to be '' , but said sales should still top analyst expectations . among areas where next could have done better , mr wolfson said menswear ranges were `` a little bit too similar to the previous year '' . mr wolfson also said that disappointing pre-christmas sales were `` more to do with the fact that we went in with too much stock rather than ( the fact that ) demand was n't there for the stock '' . next 's like-for-like store sales in the five months from 3 august to 24 december were up 2.9 % on a year earlier . this figure is for existing next stores , which were unaffected by new next store openings . like-for-like sales growth at the 49 next stores directly affected by new store openings in their locality was 0.5 % . overall sales across both its retail and mail order divisions were up 12.4 % , next said . its next directory mail order division saw sales rise 13.4 % during the five-month period . `` in terms of all the worries about their trading pre-christmas , it 's a result , '' said nick bubb , an analyst at evolution securities . `` profits of around â£420m would be well within the comfort zone . '' however , one dealer , who asked not to be named , told reuters the seasonal sales performance was `` not what people had hoped for '' . `` christmas has been tough for the whole sector , and this is one of the best retailers , '' he said . next 's trading statement comes a day after house of fraser and woolworths disappointed investors with their figures .
