women in film 'are earning less' women in the uk film industry earn less than their male counterparts despite being better qualified , according to a study released on wednesday . only 16 % of women earn more than â£50,000 , compared with 30 % of men . women make up a third of the workforce . the research was carried out jointly by the uk film council and industry training body skillset . it also found that women in the industry were less likely than men to be married or have dependant children . the study , which claims to be the most in-depth so far conducted , found 60 % of women in the film industry hold degrees , compared with 39 % of men . whilst 17 % of men in the industry had no qualifications , this was true for only five per cent of women . in the lower salary bracket , 35 % of women earn less than â£20,000 a year , compared to only 18 % of men . the research found very few women worked in the camera , sound , electrical and construction departments , but they made up a majority of those working in make-up and hairdressing . uk film council chief executive john woodward said : `` whilst the uk has benefited hugely from its highly-qualified film production workforce there are still many barriers facing people who want to get in and stay in the industry . '' `` developing the film production workforce must be underpinned with a commitment to diversity as well as training . '' the workforce is largely focused around london , with 78 % in the industry based in the capital and the south east of england . the industry depends heavily on word of mouth , with 81 % being recruited in that way . in total , only five percent of the workforce is made up of ethnic minorities , although in london the figure rises to 24 % . the necessity of completing unpaid work experience to get into the workforce has also shot up , from 5 % before the 1980s , to 45 % after 2000 .
