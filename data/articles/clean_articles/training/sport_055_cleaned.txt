holmes is hit by hamstring injury kelly holmes has been forced out of this weekend 's european indoor athletics championships after picking up a hamstring injury during training . the double olympic champion said : `` i am very disappointed that i have been forced to withdraw . `` i can hardly walk at the moment and i wo n't be able to do any running for two or three weeks although i 'll be keeping fit as best i can . '' holmes will have now have intensive treatment in south africa . the 34-year-old made a cautious start to the season but looked back to her best when she stormed to the 1,000m title at the birmingham grand prix 10 days ago . after that race and more progress in training , holmes revealed she had decided to compete at the european indoors before her plans were wrecked last weekend . `` on saturday night i pulled my hamstring running the last bend on my final 200m of the night , '' said holmes . `` i was going really , really well when i felt a massive spasm in my left leg and my hamstring blew . `` i saw the doctor here and he has said it is not serious but it 's frustrating missing madrid when i knew i was in great shape . '' holmes has now been advised by her coach margot jennings not to rush back into training and it is unlikely she will compete again until the summer . helen clitheroe now goes to madrid as the only british competitor in the women 's 1500m while there will be no representative in the 800m .
