labour mp praises tory campaign the conservatives have been `` a lot smarter '' in the way they have conducted the general election campaign , a labour backbencher has said . derek wyatt said having a five month campaign `` turned off voters '' and suggested people were already `` rather bored of the thing '' . he wants a greater campaigning role for chancellor gordon brown . labour said the economy was at the heart of the campaign and mr brown therefore had a prominent role . but mr wyatt argued : `` by some way , he is currently the figure in all of the polls that people trust and see that has delivered over eight years an economy unmatched anywhere in the world . `` so , it would be a tad foolish of the labour party if we did not use him as we have done over the past three elections . '' labour 's election chief alan milburn denied there was an attempt to sideline mr brown after facing criticism for letting the tories set the agenda . however , mr wyatt predicted the campaign would get under way properly once the chancellor delivered his budget . the mp for sittingbourne and sheppey said prime minister tony blair had been `` trying very hard '' to improve his own standing with the electorate through a `` sort of campaign of trust '' . but mr blair had been `` hurt '' by the iraq controversy , he added . a labour party spokesman played down differences with mr wyatt and said mr brown already had a prominent campaign role . `` this election is a choice between labour taking britain forward and the conservatives taking us back .
