pre-poll clash on tax and spend labour and the tories have clashed over tax and spending plans as the row over gordon brown 's budget turned into a full scale pre-election battle . tony blair claimed a tory government would `` cut '' â£35bn from public services hitting schools , hospitals and police . tory chairman liam fox accused labour of `` at best misrepresentation at worst a downright lie '' and said the `` smear '' tactics were a sign of desperation . the lib dems accused mr brown of ducking the issue of council tax rises . appearing together at a labour poster launch , the prime minister hailed his chancellor 's `` brilliant '' performance . and he claimed the tories would cut â£35bn from public services , which was the equivalent of sacking every doctor and teacher in the uk . the tories said they would not cut spending but agreed public spending would increase more slowly under their plans - leading to a total of â£33.5bn less spending than that anticipated by labour by 2011 . but they say not a single doctor , teacher or nurse will be cut . dr fox said : `` we have said we will be spending more , year on year over and above inflation . `` and to call that a cut is at best a misrepresentation , at worst a downright lie . '' tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin also predicted mr brown would have to raise taxes by â£10bn or â£11bn if labour was re-elected because he was borrowing and spending too much . for the lib dems , vince cable said the chancellor had failed to deal with the `` looming problems '' of revaluation of council tax bands which he argued would result in `` massive increases '' for some . mr brown and mr blair staged a show of unity on thursday morning , the day after the chancellor delivered a record-breaking ninth budget . mr cable said taxation as a share of the economy would go up under all three of the main parties . the chancellor meanwhile insisted his spending plans were `` affordable '' . in wednesday 's budget , mr brown doubled the level at which homebuyers pay stamp duty , unveiled a rise in child tax credit and a â£200 council tax refund for over-65s . defending the plans , he told today : `` i will take no risks with the stability of the economy . `` all our spending plans announced yesterday [ wednesday ] , including what we can do for pensioners , as well as for young families and on stamp duty and inheritance tax , all these are costed and affordable . '' in a further sign , if any were needed , that the election is approaching , the house of commons authorities have formally told mps their offices will be `` deep cleaned '' during the three-week poll campaign . mr blair has yet to name the day - but it is widely expected to be 5 may .
