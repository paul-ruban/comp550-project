mcleish ready for criticism rangers manager alex mcleish accepts he is going to be criticised after their disastrous uefa cup exit at the hands of auxerre at ibrox on wednesday . mcleish told bbc radio five live : `` we were in pole position to get through to the next stage but we blew it , we absolutely blew it . `` there 's no use burying your head in the sand , we know we are going to get a lot of criticism . `` we have to take it as we have done in the past and we must now bounce back . '' mcleish admitted his team 's defending was amateurish after watching them lose 2-0 to guy roux 's french side . `` i 'm very disappointed because we did n't give ourselves a chance , losing the first goal from our own corner . it was amateur , '' he added . `` the early goal in the second half gave us a mountain to climb and we never created the same kind of chances as we did in the first half . `` it 's difficult to take positives from the game . we 've let the fans down .
