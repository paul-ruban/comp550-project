kennedy predicts bigger turnout voters ' `` pent up passion '' could confound predictions of a low turnout in the coming general election , charles kennedy has said . the liberal democrat leader predicted concerns over iraq and other international and domestic issue would express themselves during the campaign . his comments come as an inquiry looks at how best to boost voter turnouts . ex-foreign secretary robin cook said people were not apathetic but fed up of `` pager politics '' and not being heard . he , like mr kennedy , pointed to the hundreds of thousands of people who demonstrated against plans for the iraq war . mr cook , who is giving evidence to the power inquiry into voter turnout rates , told bbc radio 4 's today programme it was not fair to blame the public who were `` more interested in politics than ever before '' . `` they are turned off by the way we do politics in britain . there 's a message there for politicians . '' he urged politicians to avoid negative campaigning and to `` speak more from the heart '' . `` we should be not so afraid to say what we stand for . '' he also criticised the cult of personality politics : `` there 's far too much interest in celebrities . `` politics are in danger of becoming another branch of the celebrity industry . '' the government has tried a number of things in an attempt to boost voter turnout , which fell to 59 % in the last general election in 2001 . this has included bringing in directly elected mayors to head local authorities and trialling postal voting .
