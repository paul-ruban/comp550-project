clijsters could play aussie open kim clijsters has denied reports that she has pulled out of january 's australian open because of her persistent wrist injury . open chief paul mcnamee had said : `` kim 's wrist obviously is n't going to be rehabilitated . '' but her spokesman insisted she had simply delayed submitting her entry . `` the doctors are assessing her injury on a weekly basis and if there is no risk she could play . but if there 's the least risk she will stay away . '' despite being absent from the wta entry list for the tournament , which begins on 17 january , clijsters would be certain to get a wild card if she requested one . clijsters is still ranked 22nd in the world despite only playing a handful of matches last season . the belgian had an operation on her left wrist early in the season but injured it again on her return to the tour . meanwhile , jelena dokic , who used to compete for australia , has opted out of the first grand slam of the season . dokic has not played in the australian open since 2001 when she lost in the first round . but the 21-year-old would have had to rely on a wild card next season because her ranking has tumbled to 127th . four-time champion monica seles , who has not played since last year 's french open , is another absentee because of an injured left foot .
