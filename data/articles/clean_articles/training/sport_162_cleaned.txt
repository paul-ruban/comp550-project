cole faces lengthy injury lay-off aston villa 's carlton cole could be out for six weeks with a knee injury . the striker , who is on a season-long loan from chelsea , picked up the knock in an england under-21 match against holland earlier this month . `` carlton will be out of action for four to six weeks after a bad challenge , '' said villa boss david o'leary . `` i wo n't be able to tell you whether he will need an operation until maybe next week . whether he has an operation has got to be left to chelsea . '' cole , who also struggled with an ankle problem earlier in the season , was unable to rest because o'leary had a shortage of strikers . the return to fitness of darius vassell after four months out with a broken ankle and the emergence of luke moore has alleviated some of the villa 's manager 's problems in that department .
