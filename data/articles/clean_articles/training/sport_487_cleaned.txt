officials respond in court row australian tennis ' top official has defended the australian open courts at melbourne park after criticism of the playing surface by lleyton hewitt . hewitt said he had had a `` gutful '' of trying to persuade them to make the surface faster but tennis australia 's geoff pollard rejected his comments . `` we did ask for it to be made faster than last year and , to my knowledge , it is faster , '' he said . `` we spent a substantial amount of money on modifications to make it faster . '' hewitt , who has not got past the fourth round at melbourne in seven attempts , had earlier said the surface was not worthy of such a prestigious tournament . but he said he would play on whatever surface he had to in order to have a chance of winning . the tournament starts on 17 january , and pollard said the surface had been speeded up since last year 's tournament following complaints by several australian players . but he refused to accept that the melbourne surface may have had a bearing on hewitt 's performances over the years . `` lleyton 's proving how versatile he is on all surfaces , '' he said . `` it is faster than last year and that 'll be faster than the one lleyton beat roger federer on in the davis cup in 2003 .
