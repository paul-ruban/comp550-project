radcliffe enjoys winning comeback paula radcliffe made a triumphant return to competitive running with victory in the new york marathon . the briton , running for the first time since dropping out of the olympic marathon and 10,000m , held off kenyan susan chepkemei in a thrilling finish . the pair were locked together for the last few miles before radcliffe finally sprinted clear to win in two hours , 23 minutes and 10 seconds . `` it 's a good way to end the year , '' she said . `` i 'm ready for a good rest now . '' radcliffe decided only recently to run in the race and many had doubted whether she had sufficiently recovered from her olympic ordeal just 11 weeks ago . but the world record-holder was prominent at the head of the field for the whole race as her rivals slowly dropped off the pace . just chepkemei and radcliffe were left in contention as the race came into the final few miles . the kenyan put in several bursts of speed to throw off radcliffe but the briton managed to hang in . both runners looked to be suffering as they reached the final mile in central park . but it was radcliffe who managed to dredge up a final sprint to see off chepkemei in the closest finish in the race 's history and in the process make a huge step in erasing the disappointment she suffered in athens .
