rush future at chester uncertain ian rush 's future as chester manager is uncertain after he and assistant mark aizlewood refused a severance package . chester have won only two of their last 10 league games but chairman steve vaughan claims he can not afford to sack the 43-year-old liverpool legend . vaughan said : `` i offered a financial settlement so they could resign with dignity but an obvious action is to dismiss them . `` i have n't because of the finances , so technically they 're still employees . '' vaughan claimed that aizlewood had `` verbally agreed '' to the offer . but the chester chairman added : `` after they discussed the offer with their solicitor , who also acts as their agent , they decided to withdraw the verbal agreement , which was disappointing . '' rush was appointed at the end of august following the departure of former liverpool team-mate mark wright , who guided chester to the conference title last season . chester were bottom of league two when rush took over but the former liverpool striker enjoyed an impressive start to managerial life , taking the club into the third round of the fa cup and winning the manager-of-the-month award for october . chester 's downturn in form culminated in a 5-0 defeat at shrewsbury that leaves them hovering just above the league two relegation zone .
