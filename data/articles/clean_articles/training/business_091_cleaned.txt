russia gets investment blessing soaring oil sales and a budget surplus mean russian debt is no longer a risky investment , one of the world 's leading credit rating agencies says . standard & poor 's has classed russian bonds as `` investment grade '' , up from their former `` speculative '' rating . russia 's reputation among investors has been hurt in recent months by the heavy tax bills and asset seizures imposed on companies such as oil giant yukos . s & p said the solidity of government finances outweighed the risk . russia is now a net creditor rather than a debtor . gold and foreign currency reserves of $ 119bn beat its foreign public debt of some $ 113bn . the other two major ratings agencies - fitch and moody 's have long since upped their rating of russia 's sovereign debt . s & p had held back through fear that the government was dragging its feet on economic and legal reforms . now , though , it has finally followed suit . but the agency made it clear that the improved rating did not mean that the risks were a thing of the past . instead , with russian government coffers brimming with tax revenues from energy sales , s & p said the government 's own debt is looking a good bet . `` these improvements are so significant that they now outweight the serious and growing political risk that continues to be a key ratings constraint on russia , '' wrote s & p credit analyst helena hessel . the yukos saga is the most high-profile of the political risks to which ms hessel alludes . the company 's founder and ex-chief executive , mikhail khodorkovsky , is in jail on trial for tax evasion and fraud . many believe the real motive for his prosecution is that he threatened to use his wealth to set up a political alternative to president vladimir putin . his company , meanwhile , is widely believed to have fallen victim to the kremlin 's wish to get russian energy resources as far as possible back under state control .
