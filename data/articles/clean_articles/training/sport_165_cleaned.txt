unclear future for striker baros liverpool forward milan baros is uncertain whether he remains part of boss rafa benitez 's plans after being dropped for the carling cup final . baros , who is liverpool 's leading scorer this season , denied reports of a row with benitez but claims he is mystified at being left on the bench . he told czech newspaper daily sport : `` i do n't know why i did n't play on sunday . i did n't argue with anybody . `` i was disappointed but i am not thinking of leaving right now . '' the czech international came on as a substitute after 74 minutes but could not prevent his side losing 3-2 to chelsea after extra-time . baros denied suggestions he wanted to leave the millennium stadium before the match upon learning of his omission from the starting line-up . but his admission that he `` guessed something like this was going to happen on saturday '' , will do little to quell claims of a falling-out with benitez . and although baros insisted thoughts of quitting anfield are `` not in my mind right now '' , he admitted `` everything is possible '' .
