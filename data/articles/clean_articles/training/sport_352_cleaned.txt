wood - ireland can win grand slam former captain keith wood believes ireland can win only their second grand slam - and first since 1948 - in this year 's rbs six nations championship . after claiming their first triple crown for 19 years last season , wood tips his former team-mates to go one better . `` things have been building up over the past few years and i think this is the year for ireland , '' he told bbc sport . `` there is a great chance to win a grand slam . a lot of things are in our favour with england and france at home . '' ireland have finished runners-up three times , including last year , since the old five nations became six in 2000 , and not finished outside the top three in the past five years . despite being without flanker keith gleeson , coach eddie o'sullivan has not had to contend with the sort of casualty lists that have hit england and scotland in particular prior to the tournament . `` for ireland to win it we need to stay relatively injury free , and fortunately we are one of the few teams that have done that so far , '' wood added . `` it is going to be tough and we need to take all the luck and opportunities that come our way . '' ireland 's last game of the tournament is against wales in cardiff - a fixture they have not lost since 1983 . but despite their traditional hospitality when the irish are visiting , wood believes wales might end their four-match losing run against england in cardiff . `` so many of the major england players have either retired in the last year or are injured that i think it will be very hard for them down in cardiff , '' wood added . `` wales have had four brilliant games in the last year or so and lost all four , so the time is right for them now to beat one of the major teams .
