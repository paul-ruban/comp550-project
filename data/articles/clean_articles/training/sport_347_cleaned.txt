moore questions captaincy brian moore believes the england captain should not be a full-back . jason robinson has led the team during their opening three defeats in the six nations tournament , in the absence of fly-half jonny wilkinson . the world champions have struggled since the retirement of former captain martin johnson , a lock forward . and former england captain moore told the bbc : `` full-backs are too far away from the action . that 's not a reflection on robinson personally . '' he added : `` i just think the point of influence needs to move closer to the pack - which is , after all , where games usually start and finish . '' moore says a lack of cohesion in the forwards is one of the reasons why england have lost against wales , france and ireland in this year 's tournament . `` assertiveness in the pack is n't there , we 're not getting enough people into the breakdowns , '' he explained . `` wer ' e not getting quick ball , which means the backs are being stifled . their creativity depends on quick ball and we 're not getting that . '' with injuries depriving him of key players like wilkinson , coach andy robinson has given youngsters such as harry ellis and jamie noon a chance . and moore believes the last two games against italy and scotland are a good opportunity to experiment further . `` the problem is the players that are around to replace the icons which have been lost because of retirement and injury do n't have the requisite experience , '' moore added . `` you ca n't do anything about that but play them . there are players who have been knocking on the door , it 's time for them to be looked at in these last two games because there 's nothing on them . `` we then go into next season with a greater certainty of who can and can not handle the pressure of international rugby .
