2d metal slug offers retro fun like some drill sergeant from the past , metal slug 3 is a wake-up call to today 's gamers molly-coddled with slick visuals and fancy trimmings . with its hand-animated sprites and 2d side-scrolling , this was even considered retro when released in arcades four years ago . but a more frantic shooter you will not find at the end of your joypad this year . and yes , that includes halo 2 . simply choose your grunt and wade through five 2d side-scrolling levels of the most hectic video game blasting you will ever encounter . it is also the toughest game you are likely to play , as hordes of enemies and few lives pile the pressure on . players must battle soldiers , snowmen , zombies , giant crabs and aliens , not to mention the huge , screen-filling bosses that guard each of the five levels . the shoot-anything-that-moves gameplay is peppered with moments of old-school genius . fans of robotic gastropods should note the title refers , instead , to the vast array of vehicles on offer in a game stuffed with bizarre hardware . tanks , jets and submarines can be commandeered , as well as cannon-toting camels , elephants and ostriches - more weaponry on offer than in an acre of iraq . doling out justice is a joy thanks to ultra responsive controls , and while this is a tough nut to crack , it is addictive enough to have you gagging for that one last go . and at a mere â£20 , metal slug 3 is as cheap as sliced , fried spuds , as the man says . of course , most of you will ignore this , lacking as it does the visual fireworks of modern blasters . but at a time when blockbuster titles offer only a fresh lick of paint in favour of real innovation , metal slug 3 is a fresh gasp of air from an era when the xbox was not even a twinkle in bill gates ' eye .
