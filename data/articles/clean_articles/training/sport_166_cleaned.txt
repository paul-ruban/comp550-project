prutton poised for lengthy fa ban southampton 's david prutton faces a possible seven-match ban when he goes before the football association . the 23-year-old has admitted two charges of improper conduct following his dismissal against arsenal . the first charge relates to his failure to leave the field promptly , pushing referee alan wiley and remonstrating with assistant referee paul norman . and the second charge is for using threatening words and/or behaviour to a match official during the 1-1 draw . paolo di canio was given a seven-match suspension when he pushed referee paul alcock over in a premiership game between sheffield wednesday and arsenal in 1998 . prutton will be joined at wednesday 's hearing by saints boss harry redknapp , who believes that the fa will throw the book at his player . redknapp himself sprinted along the touchline to help physio jim joyce and coach denis rofe shepherd the enraged prutton away from referee 's assistant norman . `` david has made a big mistake and he knows it . i ca n't condone what he 's done . he was out of order but he knows that , '' said redknapp . `` he 's a decent lad . he over-reacted badly for some reason - he had a rush of blood from somewhere . off the pitch you could n't meet a nicer lad . '' prutton has apologised publicly for his actions and to arsenal 's robert pires , who was injured in a wild tackle by the saints ' midfield man . he said : `` it 's an horrendous situation . i apologise to the ref and linesman , who were only doing their job . `` i 've also seen what happened to pires ' leg and i 'm sorry for that as well . '' `` i apologise for the people who saw it . i know you get lots of kids going to the match now and they do n't pay money to see that sort of thing . `` it 's not a cop-out , but it was all a bit of a blur . sometimes you react and it 's beyond your control , `` added prutton .
