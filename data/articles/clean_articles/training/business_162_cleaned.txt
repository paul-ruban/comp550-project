verizon 'seals takeover of mci' verizon has won a takeover battle for us phone firm mci with a bid worth $ 6.8bn ( â£3.6bn ) , reports say . the two firms are expected to seal the deal on monday morning , according to news agency reports , despite what was thought to be a higher bid from qwest . the us telecoms market is consolidating fast , with former long-distance giant at & t being bought by former subsidiary sbc earlier this year for $ 16bn . mci exited bankruptcy in april , having gone bust under previous name worldcom . the bankruptcy followed its admission in 2002 that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits . shareholders lost about $ 180bn when the company collapsed , while 20,000 workers lost their jobs . former worldcom boss bernie ebbers is currently on trial , accused of overseeing an $ 11bn fraud . qwest has itself come under suspicion of sub-standard behaviour , paying the securities and exchange commission $ 250m in october to settle charges that it manipulated its results to keep wall street happy . mci is the us 's second-biggest long distance firm after at & t . consolidation in the us telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases . a merger between mci and verizon would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since october . last week , sbc communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer at & t for about $ 16bn . buying mci would give either qwest or verizon access to mci 's global network and business-based subscribers . the rationale is similar to the one underpinning sbc 's at & t deal . verizon is by far the bigger company and has its own successful mobile arm - factors which may have swung the board in its favour since both suitors are offering a mixture of cash and shares .
