gsk aims to stop aids profiteers one of the world 's largest manufacturers of hiv/aids drugs has launched an initiative to combat the smuggling of cheaper pills - supplied to poorer african countries - back into europe for resale at far higher price . the company , glaxosmithkline , is to alter the packaging and change the colour of the pills , currently provided to developing nations under a humanitarian agreement . it is estimated that drugs companies are losing hundreds of millions of dollars each year as a result of the diversion of their products in this way . this is a very sensitive area for the big drugs companies . they want to maintain their profits , but have been put under tremendous pressure to provide cheap anti-aids drugs to the world 's poorest nations . the result is that drugs supplied to africa are now more than thirty times cheaper than those sold in europe ; bringing these medicines within the reach of millions of hiv-positive africans through their government 's health care systems . but the wide difference in price also means that there are big gains to be made from illegally diverting these cheaper drugs back into wealthier countries and re-selling them at a higher price . glaxosmithkline believes that by coating the pills destined for africa in a red dye and adding new identification codes both onto the pills and on the packaging , then this trade can be substantially reduced . the company says that it will then be possible to identify specific distributors in africa who have re-sold humanitarian drugs for profit , as well as those suppliers in europe that have also been involved in the trade . glaxo says distribution of the new-look drugs has already begun and that their chemical content is identical to those currently being sold in europe .
