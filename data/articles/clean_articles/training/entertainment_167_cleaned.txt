a-listers flock to gervais sitcom hollywood actors samuel l jackson and ben stiller have signed up for ricky gervais ' new sitcom , the comedian has told bbc news . he said they had both seen the scripts and had agreed to appear in an episode each of the sitcom extras . they join british stars jude law and kate winslet who have been booked for guest roles . the comic and actor said he had drawn up an a-list of stars he wanted and all had agreed to be in it . `` we wanted actors who had iconic status but that we could also deconstruct , '' gervais told bbc news . `` it 's not about the zeitgeist . we wanted people who would still be around in 20 years , not just the winner of big brother to take part . '' gervais admitted he was cautious about revealing who would be taking part until they had all signed on the dotted line . but he has met with stiller and jackson and they enjoyed the scripts enough to commit to it . `` i did n't want to start revealing names until it was all sorted because people just mention people who have n't even been asked . `` i have been linked with ridiculous stories recently such as i 'm going to be in a remake of 10 taking dudley moore 's part . i have n't been approached and i would n't take it anyway . '' he said stiller and jackson would be playing `` twisted '' versions of themselves in extras and that the jokes about them `` would sail pretty close to the bone '' . gervais and his writing partner stephen merchant are currently refining the scripts for the six-part series , in which gervais plays a struggling actor who bitches about the stars . meanwhile , gervais is gearing up to promote his cartoon book flanimals which is released in the us in march , around the same time as nbc begin showing the us version of the office . the film rights to flanimals have already been snapped up but gervais is keen for the project to be taken slowly . `` a film will happen over the next three years but i do n't want it to be a $ 50m movie straight away because it is not well enough known and it would n't be another spider-man or batman . i would like to do something small on tv with it first .
