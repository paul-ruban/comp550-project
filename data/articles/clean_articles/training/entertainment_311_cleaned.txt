corbett attacks 'dumbed-down tv' ronnie corbett has joined fellow comedy stars victoria wood and david jason in attacking the declining standards of british television programmes . speaking to the radio times , the two ronnies star said there is too much bad language and reality tv . `` you get fed up watching shows with not much care and love , '' he complained . corbett , soon to reunite with ronnie barker for a new two ronnies series , also criticised quiz shows like the bbc 's they think it 's all over . `` it 's just laughing at each other and thinking , 'are n't we clever ? ' '' said the 74-year-old comedian . corbett is the latest comedy star to bemoan the `` dumbing down '' of modern tv programmes . in an interview published in the radio times in january , victoria wood slated comedian sacha baron cohen for his character ali g 's `` horrible '' brand of `` victim '' humour . `` with so many good writers and good performers , it 's a shame people ca n't just write a script and have other people learn it , '' she said . and last week only fools and horses star david jason criticised british tv for being `` too safe and too cheap '' . `` we 've got to be careful not to dumb down for the audience , '' he said . `` they should n't be sitting at home on the sofa vegetating . '' corbett said he and barker were always mindful of their family audience while making the two ronnies . `` our material was good-natured , '' he said . `` we knew what would upset the average man in the street . `` there 's a lot of swearing on tv today . they even have documentaries with the f-word . '' corbett goes on to criticise `` reality programmes where they put people in a house for a fortnight and film them doing everything '' . the two ronnies ran from 1971 to 1987 and attracted 17 million viewers at its peak . its bespectacled stars will return later this year in the two ronnies sketchbook , which will combine classic sketches with newly recorded material . corbett claims he and barker differ from today 's celebrities in that they did not allow their success to go to their heads . `` we were never temperamental , fractious or walked out slamming doors , '' he said . `` we were fussy though , '' he added . `` we wanted everything done properly .
