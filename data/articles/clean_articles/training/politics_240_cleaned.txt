sport betting rules in spotlight a group of mps and peers has called for a tightening of regulations controlling betting on sport . the parliamentary group on betting and gaming held a substantial inquiry into betting last year . it followed fears that a massive increase in betting on sport , such as that done using the internet and mobile phones , has led to more cheating . the all-party group recommended 15 ways to protect punters and improve the integrity of sports betting . they include a proposal for raising the maximum jail sentence for gambling cheats above the current two years . lord condon , head of the international cricket council 's anti-corruption unit , who originally made the call for longer prison sentences , said the two-year penalty was `` derisory '' . `` you could get a bigger sentence for failing to pay your hotel bill criminally than you could for corruption in major sports . `` symbolically , a higher penalty , perhaps as the bill passes through the two houses , might be appropriate . '' the report recommended the governing bodies of sports have a say in the type of bets offered to punters , and for bookmakers to set up `` audit trails '' - something the new betting exchanges already do - to allow suspicious betting patterns to be traced . lord faulkner of worcester , who chaired the inquiry , said : `` whilst we accept that the greater part of sports betting is neither corrupt nor unfair to punters , the evidence convinces us that the growth of betting exchanges - because of the facility they provide to bet against a result - has increased the potential for corruption . `` it is important that the government works with sporting administrators to review the difficulties faced by governing bodies in convicting the guilty and penalising them appropriately . '' the panel 's aim was to try to define what constitutes cheating , assess how much might be going on and suggest what the government might do to put it right . as well as the growth of internet and mobile phone betting , there has been the creation of betting exchanges which allow punters to fix odds between themselves . betting exchanges allow punters to back ( to win ) but also lay ( to lose ) a horse . this means they can control their odds at winning by placing their money both ways .
