brown 'proud of economy record' gordon brown has delivered a rousing speech to labour 's spring conference setting out the government 's agenda for the next general election . the chancellor said he was proud of his party 's record on the economy , and would strive for continuing stability if elected . the gateshead conference was told he would help young people who were struggling to buy their own homes . and the chancellor vowed to continue the fight against child poverty . later , prime minister tony blair will answer questions sent by the public via text and e-mail . analysing mr brown 's position before the speech , bbc correspondent james hardy said mr brown would draw `` sharp dividing lines '' with the conservatives for the forthcoming election campaign . he would contrast labour 's plan to invest â£60bn in services with a tory plan to cut spending by â£35bn . `` mr brown will lay out his credentials as a reforming chancellor determined to take on and beat the asian tiger economies which increasingly dominate world trade , '' our correspondent said . on friday night , mr brown confirmed he would not make any tax commitments until the labour manifesto had been published after the budget , expected in march . but commentators will listen to his speech closely for hints on whether , as the conservatives claim , he plans to raise tax after the election . the tories accuse labour of raising taxes 66 times since coming to power in 1997 . following the chancellor 's keynote speech , the prime minister will face interactive questioning from ordinary voters on saturday . mr blair is thought to be deliberately putting himself on the line in a bid to engage the electorate ahead of an expected may election . capital radio dj margherita taylor will select questions to put to him from thousands e-mailed and sent by text . the prime minister 's enthusiasm for the job remains undimmed , alan milburn , labour 's election strategist told radio 4 's today programme on saturday . mr blair has `` the same passion and the same commitments for the job '' as when labour came to power in 1997 , he said . and he confirmed mr blair 's insistence that no poll date had yet been set . he said : `` i 'm the general election co-ordinator and i do n't know , and tony has not made up his mind . '' on friday , the prime minister completed a whistle-stop tour of england , during which he unveiled his party 's six pre-election pledges . starting in london , he visited marginal constituencies pledging to build on what he said were labour 's achievements on the economy , crime , education and public services . the conservatives and lib dems said the pledges - set to underpin labour 's election campaign - were `` worthless '' .
