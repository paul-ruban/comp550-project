profits stall at china 's lenovo profits at chinese computer firm lenovo have stood still amid slowing demand at home and stiffening competition . the firm is in the international spotlight after last year signing a deal to buy the pc division of personal computer pioneer ibm . lenovo 's profit for the three months to december was hk $ 327m ( us $ 42m ; â£22m ) , less than 1 % up on the year before . chinese pc sales have risen by a fifth in each of the past two years , but are now growing more slowly . the company is still by far the biggest player in china , with more than a quarter of the market . but western firms such as dell and hewlett-packard are also mounting a more solid fight for market share in china , and lenovo 's sales were down 3.7 % by revenue to hk $ 6.31bn . if the $ 1.75bn agreement lenovo signed with ibm on 8 december goes through , it will mark the end of an era . ibm pioneered the desktop pc market in the early 1980s , although strategic mis-steps helped lose it its early dominance . in any case , margins in pc market are now wafer thin , and profits have been hard to come by for most vendors except direct-sales giant dell . but investors have been less than impressed with lenovo 's move , designed to take it out of china and further onto the world stage . its shares are down 20 % since the announcement two months ago , largely because of the unprofitability of the unit it is buying . there have been rumours that the deal could be in trouble because us government agencies fear it could offer china opportunities for industrial espionage . the reports of the possibility of an investigation into the risk sent lenovo 's shares up 6 % in late january .
