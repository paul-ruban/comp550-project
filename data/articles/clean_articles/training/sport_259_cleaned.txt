benitez deflects blame from dudek liverpool manager rafael benitez has refused to point the finger of blame at goalkeeper jerzy dudek after portsmouth claimed a draw at anfield . dudek fumbled a cross before lomana lualua headed home an injury-time equaliser , levelling after steven gerrard put liverpool ahead . benitez said : `` it was difficult for jerzy . it was an unlucky moment . `` he was expecting a cross from matthew taylor and it ended up like a shot , so i do n't blame him for what happened . '' benitez admitted it was a costly loss of two points by liverpool , who followed up their derby defeat against everton with a disappointing draw . he said : `` we had many opportunities but did n't score and , in the end , a 1-0 lead was not enough . `` if you do n't have any chances you have to think of other things , but when you are creating so many chances as we are there is nothing you can say to the players . it was a pity . `` we lost two points , but we have one more point in the table . now we have another difficult game against newcastle and we have to recover quickly from that .
