'' in the survey carried out by icm research , 14 % of people aged between 18 and 34 said they never voted in general elections . among the over-65s , 70 % said they would be certain to vote in an immediate election , compared with 39 % of people under 55 . age concern says the over-55s are `` united around '' key areas of policy they want the government to focus on . for 57 % , pensions and the nhs were key issues , while the economy was important for a third , and tax was a crucial area for 25 % .
