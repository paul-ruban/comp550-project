'' savage 's future at birmingham has been the source of speculation for several weeks , with some fans criticising his performances for the club earlier in the season . however , good displays against west brom and aston villa have impressed blues fans . `` the crowd gave me a massive standing ovation when i came off on saturday which was nice , '' he said . `` it was fantastic even though i was criticised by a number of them in recent weeks and on saturday it showed how much i mean to them . `` it 's not for me to say ( about transfer rumours ) , it 's between the two clubs . `` i have n't created the speculation myself , i have n't phoned every national newspaper saying , 'blackburn are trying to buy me ' . it 's not up to me . '' birmingham manager steve bruce insists he does not want to sell savage . `` a lot is said and written about sav but he has been terrific for birmingham city the last two and a half years , '' he said . `` the fans love him because he epitomises them . he works hard , they like people like that and there are not many like him . `` and why the hell should i sell him to someone else ? i am not interested .
