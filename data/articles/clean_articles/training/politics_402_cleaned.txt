brown 's poll campaign move denied the government has denied reports that gordon brown is preparing to oust alan milburn as labour 's election supremo . work and pensions minister alan johnson said it was wrong to suggest the chancellor would usurp mr milburn , adding they would `` work as a team '' . a report in the sunday business claimed mr brown has been asked to take charge of media strategy , while mr milburn would move to a behind-the-scenes role . labour has always maintained mr brown would have a central campaign role . but many labour backbenchers are said to be dissatisfied with the way election campaigning has gone and have said they wanted to see the chancellor take a bigger role . some commentators say the tories have grasped the initiative , putting labour on the back foot , having to respond to conservative policy announcements . these claims follow various opinion polls which suggest the tories have been gaining on labour . party strategists are believed to want to bring mr brown to centre-stage having seen support rise , in private polling , after his budget last week . but another report in the sunday telegraph claims mr milburn is unwilling to allow any new role for the chancellor to come at his expense . mr johnson told bbc news : `` gordon brown will play a central role in any election campaign . `` they were wrong when they said milburn was ousting brown and they 're wrong now if they are saying brown is ousting milburn . we work as a team . '' mr milburn has repeatedly said the chancellor was key to the campaign and dismissed claims of a rift . neither downing street nor the labour party would comment directly on the reports .
