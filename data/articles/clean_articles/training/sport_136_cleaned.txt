iranian misses israel match iranian striker vahid hashemian will not travel to israel for bayern munich 's champions league match against maccabi tel aviv on wednesday . the german club said the player had pulled out because of a back injury . iran refuses to recognise israel 's right to exist and does not allow its citizens to travel to the country . a bayern spokesman said on monday that the decision not to take hashemian to israel had been motivated only by his physical condition . `` he 's got back pain and he could n't train , '' the spokesman said . `` it would have made no sense for him to go . '' iran gave judo world champion arash miresmaeili a $ 125,000 reward when he refused to fight an israeli at the athens olympics . the international judo federation considered taking action against miresmaeili but concluded he had been overweight for the fight and could not have taken part .
