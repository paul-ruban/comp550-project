broadband in the uk gathers pace one person in the uk is joining the internet 's fast lane every 10 seconds , according to bt . the telecoms giant said the number of people on broadband via the telephone line had now surpassed four million . including those connected via cable , almost six million people have a fast , always-on connection . the boom has been fuelled by fierce competition and falling prices , as well as the greater availability of broadband over the phone line . `` the take-up rate for broadband is accelerating at a terrific pace , '' said ben verwaayen , bt 's chief executive . `` we will be in a very strong position to hit our five million target by summer 2006 much earlier than we had previously expected . '' the last million connections were made over the past four months , with thousands of people being added to the total every day of the week . those signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from bt or via the many companies that re-sell bt lines under their own name . part of the surge in people signing up was due to bt stretching the reach of adsl - the uk 's most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond six kilometres . asymmetric digital subscriber line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds . the standard speed is 512kbps , though faster connections are available . according to bt , more than 95 % of uk homes and businesses can receive broadband over the phone line . it aims to extend this figure to 99.4 % by next summer . there are also an estimated 1.7 million cable broadband customers in the uk .
