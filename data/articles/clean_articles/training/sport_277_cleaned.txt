celtic unhappy over bulgaria date martin o'neill hopes to block stilian petrov 's call-up by bulgaria during celtic 's busy festive programme . the celtic manager does not view the friendly against valenciana - a region of spain - on 28 december as important . `` i ca n't say i was overly pleased at the fixture being played just after christmas , '' said o'neill . `` we will have to speak with the bulgarian fa . it 's their prerogative for them to arrange a fixture and our prerogative how we handle it . '' bulgaria 's game comes between celtic 's boxing day meeting with hearts and their 2 january fixture against livingston . o'neill believes the extra game will not help a midfielder whose season has already been affected by injury . `` they have organised a game at a rather awkward time , '' he added . `` when we were out playing barcelona , i spoke with the bulgarian manager , hristo stoichkov , and he mentioned this game to me . `` we pay his wages , we are the ones that if an awkward fixture is going to be played at some stage or another it should be to our benefit , rather than anyone else . `` i have said this before , but bulgaria are the one nation who seem to organise a lot of friendly games .
