home loan approvals rising again the number of mortgages approved in the uk has risen for the first time since may last year , according to lending figures from the bank of england . new loans in december rose to 83,000 , slightly higher than november 's nine-year low of 77,000 . mortgage lending rose by â£7.1bn in december , up from a â£6.4bn rise in november . the figures contradict a survey from the british bankers ' association , which said approvals were at a five-year low . analysts say the figures show the market may be stabilising but still point to further house price softness . `` the modest rise in mortgage approvals and lending in december reinforces the impression that the housing market is currently slowing steadily rather than sharply , '' said global insight analyst howard archer , commenting on the boe 's figures . the bba believes that the property market is continuing to cool down . changes to mortgage regulation may have artificially depressed figures in november , thus flattering the december figures , analysts said . in october last year , new rules came into force , which meant some lenders were forced to withdraw mortgage products temporarily in november and defer some lending until they had made sure they had complied with the rules properly . separately , the bank of england said that consumer credit rose by â£1.5bn in december , more than the â£1.4bn expected and above the â£1.4bn reported in the previous month .
