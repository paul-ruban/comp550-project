bellamy under new fire newcastle boss graeme souness has reopened his dispute with craig bellamy after claiming the welshman was `` not good enough '' for the magpies . bellamy left newcastle to join celtic on loan after a major row with souness . souness - who refused to refer to the 25-year-old by name - said bellamy did not score enough goals `` the chap that 's just gone has scored 9.3 goals a season in his time in senior football - half of those were n't even in the top flight , '' said souness . `` that 's not good enough for a striker at a club like this . `` we need to have two strikers who are near 20 goals on a regular basis . '' bellamy turned down a move to birmingham in favour of joining celtic after a disagreement about the welsh international playing out of position quickly escalated . earlier in the week , souness had said that he risked losing the confidence of the players and damaging his own reputation if he had not taken a hard line after bellamy accused him of lying . `` there are certain things you can forgive and forget , '' said souness . `` but if i 'd been seen to be weak in this case there was no future for me with the players in the dressing room or any job i have after newcastle . '' he could then return to st james ' park - and he says that he wants to . however , it would seem unlikely he will play for newcastle again as long as souness remains in charge .
