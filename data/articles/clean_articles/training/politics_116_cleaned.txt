csa 'could close ' , says minister ministers would not rule out scrapping the child support agency if it failed to improve , work and pensions secretary alan johnson has warned . but he said replacing the controversial csa would be `` the nuclear option '' . a report by the commons work and pensions committee called for the agency to be wound up unless it improved its service within weeks . chairman sir archy kirkwood said : `` if the agency can not be rescued , then it must be replaced . '' the committee reached its conclusions after it found that nearly 250,000 cases have yet to be processed . it warned that it could be five years before the csa was `` fit for purpose '' , describing it as `` a failing organisation '' and `` in crisis '' with parents facing payment delays and inaccurate maintenance calculations . the report urged the csa to draw up contingency plans , including the `` abandonment option '' , to be presented to parliament by easter , in case the cs2 computer system could not be made to work . and responding to calls for the agency to be scrapped , mr johnson told bbc radio 4 's today programme : `` i certainly would n't rule out the nuclear option of moving to a completely new system . `` but i think the select committee would agree with me we would only do that when we were absolutely convinced that this system just is n't going to work . '' the mps launched their inquiry into the csa 's performance after it became clear that , despite the introduction of a simpler system of calculating maintenance payments for new cases in 2003 , a backlog of claims was building up . the mps found the â£456m system from american it giant eds was `` nowhere near being fully functional and the number of dissatisfied , disenchanted and angry customers continues to escalate '' . faced with the committee 's criticism , the government has suspended its plan to cut the agency 's staff by 25 % . the csa has been surrounded in controversy since its introduction in 1993 to assess and enforce child support payments by absent parents . it is currently chasing outstanding payments of more than â£720m , while a further â£947m has been designated as `` unrecoverable '' . michelle , a mother of twins , said she had not received a penny of the â£57 a week she should be receiving from her ex-partner and had faced an `` on-going battle '' with the csa . her forms have twice been lost in the post , she said . `` i do n't receive correspondence , i do n't receive phone calls , i have to chase them all the time , '' she said . theresa may , tory shadow work and pensions secretary , said : `` we have got to find a way that 's going to ensure those payments get through to the people who are due them . '' the agency 's former chief executive doug smith quit last autumn claiming he was `` seriously disappointed '' with its performance . the committee said the national audit office should investigate why the eds system had gone so badly wrong . it blamed the agency 's senior management for a `` multitude of problems '' within the agency , including for an apparent lack of training of frontline staff .
