teens 'know little ' of politics teenagers questioned for a survey have shown little interest in politics - and have little knowledge . only a quarter of 14-16 year olds knew that labour was the government , the tories were the official opposition and the lib dems were the third party . almost all could identify tony blair , but only one in six knew who michael howard was , and just one in 10 recognised charles kennedy . the icm survey interviewed 110 pupils for education watchdog ofsted . nearly half those pupils polled said it was not important for them to know more about what the political parties stand for . and 4 % of those questioned thought the conservatives were in power - while 2 % of them believed the lib dems were . the survey also looked at issues of nationality . it found the union flag and fish and chips topped the list of symbols and foods associated with being british . many of the pupils also looked on themselves as english , scottish or welsh , rather than british ; while the notion of being european hardly occurred to anyone .
