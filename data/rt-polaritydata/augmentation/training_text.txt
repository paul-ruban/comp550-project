bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable . but for the most part , the weight of water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness . 
it's splash without the jokes .

ratliff's two previous titles , plutonium circus and purgatory county show his penchant for wry , contentious configurations , and this film is part of that delicate canon . 
movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of 'bold' revelation . but in 2002 , such revelations wilt . 
the film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative .

this is a movie full of grace and , ultimately , hope . 
the film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles . 
the level of maturity displayed by this 33-year-old first-time feature director is astonishing , considering her inexperience and her subject matter .

ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
energetic and boldly provocative . 
what might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody allen or mel brooks ( at least during their '70s heyday ) comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature .

if you can stomach the rough content , it's worth checking out for the performances alone . 
the original wasn't a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece ! 
makes even the claustrophobic on-board quarters seem fun . 
while not for every taste , this often very funny collegiate gross-out comedy goes a long way toward restoring the luster of the national lampoon film franchise , too long reduced to direct-to-video irrelevancy . 
what you expect is just what you get . . . assuming the bar of expectations hasn't been raised above sixth-grade height . 
the characters are more deeply thought through than in most 'right-thinking' films . 
static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , hey arnold ! would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year . 
sharp , lively , funny and ultimately sobering film . 
an enthralling , playful film that constantly frustrates our desire to know the 'truth' about this man , while deconstructing the very format of the biography in a manner that derrida would doubtless give his blessing to . 
if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of 'there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world . 
the plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish . 
evokes the style and flash of the double-cross that made mamet's " house of games " and last fall's " heist " so much fun . 
[n�s] directed the stage version of elling , and gets fine performances from his two leads who originated the characters on stage . 
too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good . 
it's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like punch-drunk love . 
because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags . 
exceptionally well acted by diane lane and richard gere . 
alternative medicine obviously has its merits . . . but ayurveda does the field no favors . 
though uniformly well acted , especially by young ballesta and galan ( a first-time actor ) , writer/director achero manas's film is schematic and obvious . 
adam sandler ! in an art film ! 
while the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an american movie might demand , scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a hollywood production . 
the reason to see " sade " lay with the chemistry and complex relationship between the marquis ( auteil ) and emilie ( le besco ) . 
sluggish , tonally uneven . 
it's almost as if it's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film . 
it's a setup so easy it borders on facile , but keeping the film from cheap-shot mediocrity is its crack cast . 
screenwriter dan schneider and director shawn levy substitute volume and primary colors for humor and bite . 
what sets ms . birot's film apart from others in the genre is a greater attention to the parents -- and particularly the fateful fathers -- in the emotional evolution of the two bewitched adolescents . 
swinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit . or intelligent . 
there aren't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming ( without a thick shmear of the goo , at least ) , but " elling " manages to do all three quite well , making it one of the year's most enjoyable releases . 
a sudsy cautionary tale . 
ultimately feels empty and unsatisfying , like swallowing a communion wafer without the wine . 
if divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood suffers from a ploddingly melodramatic structure , it comes to life in the performances . 
troubling and powerful . 
godard uses his characters -- if that's not too glorified a term -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks . 
after seeing swept away , i feel sorry for madonna . 
 . . . what a banal bore the preachy circuit turns out to be
super troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early zucker brothers/abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , the farrelly brothers . 
the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them . 
makes one thing abundantly clear . american musical comedy as we know it wouldn't exist without the precedent of yiddish theater , whose jolly , fun-for-fun's-sake communal spirit goes to the essence of broadway . 
mike white's deft combination of serious subject matter and dark , funny humor make " " the good girl " a film worth watching . 
films are made of little moments . changing lanes tries for more . it doesn't reach them , but the effort is gratefully received . 
this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic . 
a captivating coming-of-age story that may also be the first narrative film to be truly informed by the wireless age . 
this wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt , it's the worst movie i've seen this summer . 
the story and structure are well-honed . fresnadillo's dark and jolting images have a way of plying into your subconscious like the nightmare you had a week ago that won't go away . 
those eternally devoted to the insanity of black will have an intermittently good time . feel free to go get popcorn whenever he's not onscreen . 
if a horror movie's primary goal is to frighten and disturb , then they works spectacularly well . . . a shiver-inducing , nerve-rattling ride . 
more timely than its director could ever have dreamed , this quietly lyrical tale probes the ambiguous welcome extended by iran to the afghani refugees who streamed across its borders , desperate for work and food . 
every dance becomes about seduction , where backstabbing and betrayals are celebrated , and sex is currency . 
a full-frontal attack on audience patience . 
it's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence . 
this is a happy throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema's most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable . 
a real audience-pleaser that will strike a chord with anyone who's ever waited in a doctor's office , emergency room , hospital bed or insurance company office . 
labute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public . 
there is no pleasure in watching a child suffer . just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame . 
real women have curves wears its empowerment on its sleeve but even its worst harangues are easy to swallow thanks to remarkable performances by ferrera and ontiveros . 
the chateau is a risky venture that never quite goes where you expect and often surprises you with unexpected comedy . 
even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness . 
twenty years later , e . t . is still a cinematic touchstone . 
 . . . liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . too bad . 
sch�tte's dramatic snapshot of the artist three days before his death offers an interesting bit of speculation as to the issues brecht faced as his life drew to a close . 
simply doesn't have sufficient heft to justify its two-hour running time . 
whether quitting will prove absorbing to american audiences is debatable . 
it's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent electra rebellion . 
 . . . a sour little movie at its core ; an exploration of the emptiness that underlay the relentless gaiety of the 1920's . . . the film's ending has a " what was it all for ? " feeling to it , but like the 1920's , the trip there is a great deal of fun . 
a well-done film of a self-reflexive , philosophical nature . 
this strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook . 
will grab your children by the imagination and amaze them and amuse them . 
is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of wilco's last album ? 
an ironic speculation on democracy in a culture unaccustomed to it . 
manages to delight without much of a story . 
howard conjures the past via surrealist flourishes so overwrought you'd swear he just stepped out of a bu�uel retrospective . 
baby-faced renner is eerily convincing as this bland blank of a man with unimaginable demons within . 
a moving story of determination and the human spirit . 
unfortunately , it appears that [jackie] chan's us influence is starting to show in his hong kong films . 
a lovely film for the holiday season . 
a sour attempt at making a farrelly brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher for the female set . 
this 90-minute dud could pass for mike tyson's e ! true hollywood story . 
director kapur is a filmmaker with a real flair for epic landscapes and adventure , and this is a better film than his earlier english-language movie , the overpraised elizabeth . 
this is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least . 
an intense and effective film about loneliness and the chilly anonymity of the environments where so many of us spend so much of our time . 
director benoit jacquot , making his first opera-to-film translation with tosca , conveys the heaving passion of puccini's famous love-jealousy- murder-suicide fandango with great cinematic innovation . 
tres greek writer and star nia vardalos has crafted here a worldly-wise and very funny script . 
mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that's because relatively nothing happens . 
a coming-of-age movie that hollywood wouldn't have the guts to make . 
 . . . a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that i can't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here . 
suffers from all the excesses of the genre . 
grenier is terrific , bringing an unforced , rapid-fire delivery to toback's heidegger- and nietzsche-referencing dialogue . 
'easily my choice for one of the year's best films . '
this is a nicely handled affair , a film about human darkness but etched with a light ( yet unsentimental ) touch . 
those who don't entirely 'get' godard's distinctive discourse will still come away with a sense of his reserved but existential poignancy . 
there is a general air of exuberance in all about the benjamins that's hard to resist . 
one of the best films of the year with its exploration of the obstacles to happiness faced by five contemporary individuals . . . a psychological masterpiece . 
stephen earnhart's homespun documentary mule skinner blues has nothing but love for its posse of trailer park denizens . 
it has charm to spare , and unlike many romantic comedies , it does not alienate either gender in the audience . 
mr . goyer's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way . 
do not see this film . 
the movie is our story as much as it is schmidt's , no matter if it's viewed as a self-reflection or cautionary tale . 
it's better than mid-range steven seagal , but not as sharp as jet li on rollerblades . 
the screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable . 
one of those energetic surprises , an original that pleases almost everyone who sees it . 
tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen . 
[green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i'm just about ready to go to the u . n . and ask permission for a preemptive strike . 
the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is . 
an extremely unpleasant film . 
it's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can . 
steve oedekerk is , alas , no woody allen . 
kwan makes the mix-and- match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action . 
meyjes' provocative film might be called an example of the haphazardness of evil . 
its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film . 
fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor . 
an inventive , absorbing movie that's as hard to classify as it is hard to resist . 
sets animation back 30 years , musicals back 40 years and judaism back at least 50 . 
an eccentric little comic/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality . 
the problem with antwone fisher is that it has a screenplay written by antwone fisher based on the book by antwone fisher . 
it's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center . 
what's surprising is how well it holds up in an era in which computer-generated images are the norm . 
y tu mam� tambi�n is hilariously , gloriously alive , and quite often hotter than georgia asphalt . 
the film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness . 
apparently , romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just doesn't figure in the present hollywood program . 
none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest . 
the bottom line is the piece works brilliantly . 
perhaps even the slc high command found writer-director mitch davis's wall of kitsch hard going . 
an occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten . 
the performances are so leaden , michael rymer's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud . 
it's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it doesn't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks . 
kinnear and dafoe give what may be the performances of their careers . 
this sort of cute and cloying material is far from zhang's forte and it shows . 
a quiet , pure , elliptical film
the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game . you try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored . 
blade ii has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation . 
chilling , well-acted , and finely directed : david jacobson's dahmer . 
the three leads produce adequate performances , but what's missing from this material is any depth of feeling . 
the movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students . 
stale first act , scrooge story , blatant product placement , some very good comedic songs , strong finish , dumb fart jokes . 
there's no palpable chemistry between lopez and male lead ralph fiennes , plus the script by working girl scribe kevin wade is workmanlike in the extreme . 
 . . . there are enough moments of heartbreaking honesty to keep one glued to the screen . 
one of the most depressing movie-going experiences i can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called 'comedy' and not laugh once . 
the satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying . 
deflated ending aside , there's much to recommend the film . 
greengrass ( working from don mullan's script ) forgoes the larger socio-political picture of the situation in northern ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation . 
caviezel embodies the transformation of his character completely . 
the makers of mothman prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad . 
god help the poor woman if attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional yvan's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse . 
it's a beautifully accomplished lyrical meditation on a bunch of despondent and vulnerable characters living in the renown chelsea hotel . . . 
schaeffer isn't in this film , which may be why it works as well as it does . 
 . . . blade ii is more enjoyable than the original . 
a silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker . 
for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout . 
distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register . 
i am highly amused by the idea that we have come to a point in society where it has been deemed important enough to make a film in which someone has to be hired to portray richard dawson . 
when the precise nature of matthew's predicament finally comes into sharp focus , the revelation fails to justify the build-up . 
movies like high crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation . how about surprising us by trying something new ? 
you may be galled that you've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie . 
loosely speaking , we're in all of me territory again , and , strictly speaking , schneider is no steve martin . 
a soap-opera quality twist in the last 20 minutes . . . almost puts the kibosh on what is otherwise a sumptuous work of b-movie imagination . 
the tone errs on the shrill side , tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty , grace and a closet full of skeletons . 
the only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants . . . who might be distracted by the movie's quick movements and sounds . 
watching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but boyd's film offers little else of consequence . 
the skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense . 
in its own floundering way , it gets to you . just like igby . 
morton uses her face and her body language to bring us morvern's soul , even though the character is almost completely deadpan . 
this feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
a french film with a more down-home flavor . 
a charming yet poignant tale of the irrevocable ties that bind . 
i'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap clich� . 
it's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism . 
moretti . . . is the rare common-man artist who's wise enough to recognize that there are few things in this world more complex -- and , as it turns out , more fragile -- than happiness . 
look , this is a terrific flick replete with dazzling camera-work , dancing and music . 
femme fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience . are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue ? 
a sexy , peculiar and always entertaining costume drama set in renaissance spain , and the fact that it's based on true events somehow makes it all the more compelling . 
it's sobering , particularly if anyone still thinks this conflict can be resolved easily , or soon . 
apart from dazzling cinematography , we've seen just about everything in blue crush in one form or the other . 
boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect . 
delivers the sexy razzle-dazzle that everyone , especially movie musical fans , has been hoping for . 
it remains to be seen whether statham can move beyond the crime-land action genre , but then again , who says he has to ? 
beautiful to watch and holds a certain charm . 
cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude . it makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy's idea of a good time . 
this pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film's producers would be in the clink for life . 
elling , portrayed with quiet fastidiousness by per christian ellefsen , is a truly singular character , one whose frailties are only slightly magnified versions of the ones that vex nearly everyone . 
oh , james ! your 20th outing shows off a lot of stamina and vitality , and get this , madonna's cameo doesn't suck ! 
i encourage young and old alike to go see this unique and entertaining twist on the classic whale's tale -- you won't be sorry ! 
a captivatingly quirky hybrid of character portrait , romantic comedy and beat-the-clock thriller . 
the lousy lead performances . . . keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired . 
it collapses when mr . taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller's rush . 
a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture . 
represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen . 
most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots . the movie isn't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave . 
billy crystal and robert de niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse . 
there's a vastness implied in metropolis that is just breathtaking . 
however sincere it may be , the rising place never quite justifies its own existence . 
shamelessly resorting to pee-related sight gags that might even cause tom green a grimace ; still , myer's energy and the silliness of it all eventually prevail
although estela bravo's documentary is cloyingly hagiographic in its portrait of cuban leader fidel castro , it's still a guilty pleasure to watch . 
kaufman and jonze take huge risks to ponder the whole notion of passion -- our desire as human beings for passion in our lives and the emptiness one feels when it is missing . 
i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd . 
just another fish-out-of-water story that barely stays afloat . 
too sincere to exploit its subjects and too honest to manipulate its audience . 
one scene after another in this supposedly funny movie falls to the floor with a sickening thud . 
a muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that doesn't make much sense even on its own terms . 
beautiful , angry and sad , with a curious sick poetry , as if the marquis de sade had gone in for pastel landscapes . 
if you can get past the taboo subject matter , it will be well worth your time . 
simone is not a bad film . it just doesn't have anything really interesting to say . 
this is one of mr . chabrol's subtlest works , but also one of his most uncanny . 
the 3-d vistas from orbit , with the space station suspended like a huge set of wind chimes over the great blue globe , are stanzas of breathtaking , awe-inspiring visual poetry . 
whether jason x is this bad on purpose is never clear . but one thing's for sure : it never comes close to being either funny or scary . 
i'm sure there's a teenage boy out there somewhere who's dying for this kind of entertainment . 
visually breathtaking , viscerally exciting , and dramatically moving , it's the very definition of epic adventure . 
beautifully crafted and brutally honest , promises offers an unexpected window into the complexities of the middle east struggle and into the humanity of its people . 
sade achieves the near-impossible : it turns the marquis de sade into a dullard . 
even if you don't understand what on earth is going on , this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why . 
oops , she's really done it this time . that chirpy songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel . 
a bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points . 
blithely anachronistic and slyly achronological . 
the most ingenious film comedy since being john malkovich . 
it's still a comic book , but maguire makes it a comic book with soul . 
children may not understand everything that happens -- i'm not sure even miyazaki himself does -- but they will almost certainly be fascinated , and undoubtedly delighted . 
slap her - she's not funny ! no french people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half . 
a perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie . 
[macdowell] ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is . 
a perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little lilo & stitch had in spades -- charisma . 
well made but uninvolving , bloodwork isn't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery . 
it is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness . 
[reaches] wholly believable and heart-wrenching depths of despair . 
even if you're an elvis person , you won't find anything to get excited about on this dvd . 
a cop story that understands the medium amazingly well . 
much as we might be interested in gratuitous sexualization , haneke has a different objective in mind--namely the implications of our craving for fake stimulation . 
in spite of good housekeeping's unsavory characters and wwf mentality , this white trash war of the roses is a surprisingly engaging film . 
eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work . but even a hero can stumble sometimes . 
turns potentially forgettable formula into something strangely diverting . 
the movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time . 
passion , melodrama , sorrow , laugther , and tears cascade over the screen effortlessly . . . 
the strong subject matter continues to shock throughout the film . not everyone will play the dark , challenging tune taught by the piano teacher . 
rarely has a film's title served such dire warning . 
an awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it . 
the ending does leave you unfulfilled , but these are performances to enjoy in a memorable ensemble piece . 
 . . . pitiful , slapdash disaster . a doa dud from frame one . 
feature debuter d . j . caruso directs a crack ensemble cast , bringing screenwriter tony gayton's narcotics noir to life . 
a sensitive , modest comic tragedy that works as both character study and symbolic examination of the huge economic changes sweeping modern china . 
preaches to two completely different choirs at the same time , which is a pretty amazing accomplishment . 
a beguiling splash of pastel colors and prankish comedy from disney . 
a low-rent retread of the alien pictures . 
what we get . . . is caddyshack crossed with the loyal order of raccoons . 
one groan-inducing familiarity begets another . 
none of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of bond , but much of it is good for a laugh . the problem with " xxx " is that its own action isn't very effective . 
unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , impostor is opening today at a theater near you . 
solaris " is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work . 
chilling but uncommercial look into the mind of jeffrey dahmer , serial killer . 
red dragon makes one appreciate silence of the lambs . 
a study in shades of gray , offering itself up in subtle plot maneuvers . . . 
it's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong . 
anemic , pretentious . 
although it bangs a very cliched drum at times , this crowd-pleaser's fresh dialogue , energetic music , and good-natured spunk are often infectious . 
an inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle . 
once the audience figure out what's being said , the filmmaker's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care . 
according to the script , grant and bullock's characters are made for each other . but you'd never guess that from the performances . 
candid camera on methamphetamines . 
the film reminds me of a vastly improved germanic version of my big fat greek wedding -- with better characters , some genuine quirkiness and at least a measure of style . the difference is that i truly enjoyed most of mostly martha while i ne
its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up . 
antwone fisher certainly does the trick of making us care about its protagonist and celebrate his victories but , with few exceptions , it rarely stoops to cheap manipulation or corny conventions to do it . 
lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose . 
as an entertainment destination for the general public , kung pow sets a new benchmark for lameness . 
no matter how you slice it , mark wahlberg and thandie newton are not hepburn and grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore . 
dong shows how intolerance has the power to deform families , then tear them apart . 
it has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and r&b names and references . 
the vampire thriller blade ii starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun � toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout . 
a movie that's held captive by mediocrity . not bad , but not all that good . bacon keeps things interesting , but don't go out of your way to pay full price . 
there's an energy to y tu mam� tambi�n . much of it comes from the brave , uninhibited performances by its lead actors . 
the fact that the 'best part' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of demme's good films doesn't bode well for the rest of it . 
 . . . a good , if not entirely fresh , look at war . 
this movie has the usual impossible stunts . . . but it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie . 
�an adorably whimsical comedy that deserves more than a passing twinkle . 
es una de esas pel�culas de las que uno sale reconfortado , agradecido , genuinamente sorprendido . 
one of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i've ever seen . 
a movie in which laughter and self-exploitation merge into jolly soft-porn 'empowerment . '
could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ? that's the only sane rationale i can think of for swimfan's existence . 
much of the movie's charm lies in the utter cuteness of stuart and margolo . their computer-animated faces are very expressive . 
amid the clich� and foreshadowing , cage manages a degree of casual realism . . . that is routinely dynamited by blethyn . 
a delectable and intriguing thriller filled with surprises , read my lips is an original . this is a story of two misfits who don't stand a chance alone , but together they are magnificent . 
an enthralling aesthetic experience , one that's steeped in mystery and a ravishing , baroque beauty . 
a weird and wonderful comedy . 
it's a bit disappointing that it only manages to be decent instead of dead brilliant . 
the film is saved from aren't-kids-cute sentimentality by a warmth that isn't faked and a stately sense of composition . 
feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake . 
as his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in long time dead says 'i'm telling you , this is f * * * ed' . maybe he was reading the minds of the audience . 
this is junk food cinema at its greasiest . 
a summary of the plot doesn't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution . 
the quiet american isn't a bad film , it's just one that could easily wait for your pay per view dollar . 
the plot's clearly mythic structure may owe more to disney's strong sense of formula than to the original story . but while the highly predictable narrative falls short , treasure planet is truly gorgeous to behold . 
a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it's sort of true and it's sort of bogus and it's ho-hum all the way through . 
benefits from a strong performance from zhao , but it's dong jie's face you remember at the end . 
[clooney's] debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined , but it has a tremendous , offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him , especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh . 
the movie is saved from unbearable lightness by the simplicity of the storytelling and the authenticity of the performances .

[janey] forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies . 
the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction . 
what makes salton sea surprisingly engrossing is that caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that's often handled in fast-edit , hopped-up fashion .

it's not difficult to spot the culprit early-on in this predictable thriller . 
this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring

renner's performance as dahmer is unforgettable , deeply absorbing .

an often unfunny romp . 
no such thing is sort of a minimalist beauty and the beast , but in this case the beast should definitely get top billing . robert john burke as the monster horns in and steals the show .

cho continues her exploration of the outer limits of raunch with considerable brio . 
the whole film has this sneaky feel to it � as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product .

professionally speaking , it's tempting to jump ship in january to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller . 
a cautionary tale about the grandiosity of a college student who sees himself as impervious to a fall . 
diaz , applegate , blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused . 
it's never laugh-out-loud funny , but it is frequently amusing . 
visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide treasure planet entirely and completely reimagine it . 
[a] painfully flat gross-out comedy . . . 
stealing harvard doesn't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor . 
stuart's poor-me persona needs a whole bunch of snowball's cynicism to cut through the sugar coating . but once the falcon arrives in the skies above manhattan , the adventure is on red alert . 
it was a dark and stormy night . . . 
might best be enjoyed as a daytime soaper . 
a fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending . certainly the big finish wasn't something galinsky and hawley could have planned for . . . but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps .

unlike most teen flicks , swimming takes its time to tell its story , casts mostly little-known performers in key roles , and introduces some intriguing ambiguity . 
adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse . 
offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented . 
so original in its base concept that you cannot help but get caught up . 
a very familiar tale , one that's been told by countless filmmakers about italian- , chinese- , irish- , latin- , indian- , russian- and other hyphenate american young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages .

la cinta comienza intentando ser un drama , r�pidamente se transforma en una comedia y termina por ser una parodia absolutamente predecible
shouldn't have been allowed to use the word " new " in its title , because there's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie . 
i don't know if frailty will turn bill paxton into an a-list director , but he can rest contentedly with the knowledge that he's made at least one damn fine horror movie . 
the hard-to-predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the down-to-earth bullock and the nonchalant grant proves to be sensational , and everything meshes in this elegant entertainment . 
contains the humor , characterization , poignancy , and intelligence of a bad sitcom . 
minority report is exactly what the title indicates , a report . 
each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense . 
has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies . . . 
jacquot's tosca is a treat . 
my big fat greek wedding uses stereotypes in a delightful blend of sweet romance and lovingly dished out humor . 
much like robin williams , death to smoochy has already reached its expiration date . 
on the surface , it's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , but it has a lot in common with piesiewicz's and kieslowski's earlier work , films like the double life of veronique . 
the inhospitability of the land emphasizes the spare precision of the narratives and helps to give them an atavistic power , as if they were tales that had been handed down since the beginning of time . 
the band's courage in the face of official repression is inspiring , especially for aging hippies ( this one included ) . 
a minor film with major pleasures from portuguese master manoel de oliviera . . . 
it's surprisingly decent , particularly for a tenth installment in a series . 
falsehoods pile up , undermining the movie's reality and stifling its creator's comic voice . 
an encouraging effort from mccrudden
the format gets used best . . . to capture the dizzying heights achieved by motocross and bmx riders , whose balletic hotdogging occasionally ends in bone-crushing screwups . 
though it draws several decent laughs , it's low-cal woody at best . 
you expect more from director michael apted ( enigma ) and screenwriter nicholas kazan ( reversal of fortune ) than this cliche pileup . 
great over-the-top moviemaking if you're in a slap-happy mood . 
director roger michell does so many of the little things right that it's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff . 
tender yet lacerating and darkly funny fable .

it's one of the most honest films ever made about hollywood . 
you will emerge with a clearer view of how the gears of justice grind on and the death report comes to share airtime alongside the farm report . 
essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality
this misty-eyed southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand . 
an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting . 
a wildly inconsistent emotional experience . 
as surreal as a dream and as detailed as a photograph , as visually dexterous as it is at times imaginatively overwhelming . 
it's a humble effort , but spiced with wry humor and genuine pathos , especially between morgan and redgrave . 
by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it . . . . then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop . 
[the film] tackles the topic of relationships in such a straightforward , emotionally honest manner that by the end , it's impossible to ascertain whether the film is , at its core , deeply pessimistic or quietly hopeful . 
the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes . 
a sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis . 
a different kind of love story - one that is dark , disturbing , painful to watch , yet compelling . 
 . . . [the film] works , due mostly to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay . 
 . . . only bond can save us from the latest eccentric , super-wealthy megalomaniac bent on world domination and destruction . 
the campy results make mel brooks' borscht belt schtick look sophisticated . 
this is standard crime drama fare . . . instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull . 
too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style . 
it's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in there's something about mary and devise a parallel clone-gag . 
after an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be .

the path ice age follows most closely , though , is the one established by warner bros . giant chuck jones , who died a matter of weeks before the movie's release . 
a fascinating documentary that provides a rounded and revealing overview of this ancient holistic healing system
the film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility . 
once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea isn't funny . 
with an obvious rapport with her actors and a striking style behind the camera , h�l�ne angel is definitely a director to watch . 
see it . debate it . remember it .

everything about the quiet american is good , except its timing . 
sluggishly directed by episodic tv veteran joe zwick , it's a sitcom without the snap-crackle . 
the case is a convincing one , and should give anyone with a conscience reason to pause . 
it stars schticky chris rock and stolid anthony hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie . their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it's just a weird fizzle . 
 . . . jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just isn't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead's specific gifts . 
evelyn's strong cast and surehanded direction make for a winning , heartwarming yarn . 
in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works . 
there's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue . 
the criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters . . . 
nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters . 
thanks to the ch�teau's balance of whimsicality , narrative discipline and serious improvisation , almost every relationship and personality in the film yields surprises . 
confessions isn't always coherent , but it's sharply comic and surprisingly touching , so hold the gong . 
for movie lovers as well as opera lovers , tosca is a real treat . 
it made me realize that we really haven't had a good cheesy b-movie playing in theaters since . . . well . . . since last week's reign of fire . 
the film is filled with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life as seen through the eyes outsiders , but deftly manages to avoid many of the condescending stereotypes that so often plague films dealing with the mentally ill . 
bow's best moments are when he's getting busy on the basketball court because that's when he really scores . 
if somebody was bored and . . . decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus' son , they'd come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler . 
steers turns in a snappy screenplay that curls at the edges ; it's so clever you want to hate it . but he somehow pulls it off . 
lauren ambrose comes alive under the attention from two strangers in town - with honest performances and realistic interaction between the characters , this is a coming-of-age story with a twist . 
patchy combination of soap opera , low-tech magic realism and , at times , ploddingly sociological commentary . 
by turns very dark and very funny . 
reign of fire just might go down as one of the all-time great apocalypse movies . 
this is as powerful a set of evidence as you'll ever find of why art matters , and how it can resonate far beyond museum walls and through to the most painfully marginal lives . 
visually engrossing , seldom hammy , honorably mexican and burns its kahlories with conviction . 
a well-made but emotionally scattered film whose hero gives his heart only to the dog . 
austin powers in goldmember is a cinematic car wreck , a catastrophic collision of tastelessness and gall that nevertheless will leave fans clamoring for another ride . 
human nature is a goofball movie , in the way that malkovich was , but it tries too hard . 
the movie makes absolutely no sense . its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ? 
the movie , directed by mick jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting . 
true tale of courage -- and complicity -- at auschwitz is a harrowing drama that tries to tell of the unspeakable . 
one of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution . 
impostor is a step down for director gary fleder . 
less about shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw quentin tarantino's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations . 
alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick . 
its sheer dynamism is infectious . 
at a time when we've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is , collateral damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture . 
 . . . generically , forgettably pleasant from start to finish . 
kinnear . . . gives his best screen performance with an oddly winning portrayal of one of life's ultimate losers . 
it's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition . 
the overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of " 7th heaven . " 
anyway , for one reason or another , crush turns into a dire drama partway through . after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin . too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it's not a total loss . 
one of the smartest takes on singles culture i've seen in a long time . 
one of the funnier movies in town . 
invigorating , surreal , and resonant with a rainbow of emotion . 
an undeniably moving film to experience , and ultimately that's what makes it worth a recommendation . 
so exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming . 
it's a perfect show of respect to just one of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it . 
green ruins every single scene he's in , and the film , while it's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that . 
the real question this movie poses is not 'who ? ' but 'why ? '
even by dumb action-movie standards , ballistic : ecks vs . sever is a dumb action movie . 
the audacity to view one of shakespeare's better known tragedies as a dark comedy is , by itself , deserving of discussion . 
as a movie , it never seems fresh and vital . it never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people . it labours as storytelling . 
some body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves . 
if the last man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows . 
it's fun , splashy and entertainingly nasty . 
it's always fascinating to watch marker the essayist at work . 
largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers . 
i was trying to decide what annoyed me most about god is great . . . i'm not , and then i realized that i just didn't care . 
the first shocking thing about sorority boys is that it's actually watchable . even more baffling is that it's funny . 
the period -- swinging london in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in gangster no . 1 , but falls apart long before the end . 
drama of temptation , salvation and good intentions is a thoughtful examination of faith , love and power . 
a triumph , a film that hews out a world and carries us effortlessly from darkness to light . 
god bless crudup and his aversion to taking the easy hollywood road and cashing in on his movie-star gorgeousness . 
wallace seems less like he's been burning to tell a war story than he's been itching to somehow tack one together
it's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script . 
it all adds up to good fun . 
the movie's seams may show . . . but pellington gives " mothman " an irresistibly uncanny ambience that goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling . 
the sundance film festival has become so buzz-obsessed that fans and producers descend upon utah each january to ferret out the next great thing . 'tadpole' was one of the films so declared this year , but it's really more of the next pretty good thing . 
verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies . 
a little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt . 
what happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ? 
the premise itself is just sooooo tired . pair that with really poor comedic writing . . . and you've got a huge mess . 
we do get the distinct impression that this franchise is drawing to a close . 
despite its old-hat set-up and predictable plot , empire still has enough moments to keep it entertaining . 
a canny , derivative , wildly gruesome portrait of a london sociopath who's the scariest of sadists . 
a brutal and funny work . nicole holofcenter , the insightful writer/director responsible for this illuminating comedy doesn't wrap the proceedings up neatly but the ideas tie together beautifully . 
somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional . 
stealing harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious . 
charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions . 
crummy
a very pretty after-school special . it's an effort to watch this movie , but it eventually pays off and is effective if you stick with it . 
cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny . 
jeffrey tambor's performance as the intelligent jazz-playing exterminator is oscar-worthy . 
a visionary marvel , but it's lacking a depth in storytelling usually found in anime like this . 
if you're a wwf fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in a . i . , you'll probably like rollerball . 
every note rings false . 
i've had more interesting -- and , dare i say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama . 
though overall an overwhelmingly positive portrayal , the film doesn't ignore the more problematic aspects of brown's life . 
the people in jessica are so recognizable and true that , as in real life , we're never sure how things will work out . 
peter jackson has done the nearly impossible . he has improved upon the first and taken it a step further , richer and deeper . what jackson has done is proven that no amount of imagination , no creature , no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery
beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines . . . there just isn't much to laugh at . 
steven spielberg brings us another masterpiece
falls short in explaining the music and its roots . 
 . . . a visually seductive , unrepentantly trashy take on rice's second installment of her vampire chronicles . 
for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry . 
wait for it to hit cable . 
should have gone straight to video . it looks like an action movie , but it's so poorly made , on all levels , that it doesn't even qualify as a spoof of such . 
ford deserves to be remembered at oscar time for crafting this wonderful portrait of a conflicted soldier . 
a film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted . 
maintains your sympathy for this otherwise challenging soul by letting you share her one-room world for a while . 
certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic . 
if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna . 
while certain cues , like the happy music , suggest that this movie is supposed to warm our hearts , jeong-hyang lee's film is just as likely to blacken that organ with cold vengefulness . 
the plot combines the blues brothers and almost famous ( but with bears , and a g rating ) , with an excruciating dollop of disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure . 
there's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy . 
writer-director juan carlos fresnadillo makes a feature debut that is fully formed and remarkably assured . 
since dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche . 
shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme . 
the film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe . 
it virtually defines a comedy that's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while . 
uplifting , funny and wise . 
an uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection . 
will certainly appeal to asian cult cinema fans and asiaphiles interested to see what all the fuss is about . 
 . . . little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen . 
the final result makes for adequate entertainment , i suppose , but anyone who has seen chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal . 
has the rare capability to soothe and break your heart with a single stroke . 
it's a remarkably solid and subtly satirical tour de force . 
the situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels . 
the message of such reflections--intentional or not--is that while no art grows from a vacuum , many artists exist in one . 
dark and disturbing , yet compelling to watch . 
it's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert . 
this franchise has not spawned a single good film . the crap continues . 
it's fun , wispy , wise and surprisingly inoffensive for a film about a teen in love with his stepmom . 
the adventure doesn't contain half the excitement of balto , or quarter the fun of toy story 2 . 
give shapiro , goldman , and bolado credit for good intentions , but there's nothing here that they couldn't have done in half an hour . 
it jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding m�tier . 
an exhilarating serving of movie fluff . 
this is a harrowing movie about how parents know where all the buttons are , and how to push them . 
a searing , epic treatment of a nationwide blight that seems to be , horrifyingly , ever on the rise . 
it uses an old-time formula , it's not terribly original and it's rather messy -- but you just have to love the big , dumb , happy movie my big fat greek wedding . 
while this gentle and affecting melodrama will have luvvies in raptures , it's far too slight and introspective to appeal to anything wider than a niche audience . 
for decades we've marveled at disney's rendering of water , snow , flames and shadows in a hand-drawn animated world . prepare to marvel again . 
douglas mcgrath's nicholas nickleby does dickens as it should be done cinematically . 
the drama discloses almost nothing . 
writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic . 
 . . . quite good at providing some good old fashioned spooks . 
involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd . 
mcgrath has deftly trimmed dickens' wonderfully sprawling soap opera , the better to focus on the hero's odyssey from cowering poverty to courage and happiness . 
this ill-conceived and expensive project winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it . 
in its best moments , resembles a bad high school production of grease , without benefit of song . 
being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film . 
essentially a collection of bits -- and they're all naughty . 
the best film of the year 2002 . 
manages to be sweet and wickedly satisfying at the same time . 
a tasty appetizer that leaves you wanting more . 
not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans . 
some body will take you places you haven't been , and also places you have . 
drowning's too good for this sucker . 
a subtle , poignant picture of goodness that is flawed , compromised and sad . 
like the tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
 . . . a delightfully unpredictable , hilarious comedy with wonderful performances that tug at your heart in ways that utterly transcend gender labels . 
angel presents events partly from the perspective of aurelie and christelle , and infuses the film with the sensibility of a particularly nightmarish fairytale . 
in this film , aussie david caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of guy ritchie . 
engages us in constant fits of laughter , until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story , and end up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched . 
there are plenty of scenes in frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself . 
even if you're an agnostic carnivore , you can enjoy much of jonah simply , and gratefully , as laugh-out-loud lunacy with a pronounced monty pythonesque flavor . 
the search for redemption makes for a touching love story , mainly because blanchett and ribisi compellingly tap into a spiritual aspect of their characters' suffering . 
the film's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed crudup out of pre-9/11 new york and onto a cross-country road trip of the homeric kind . 
there's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like lavinia , to go the conservative route . 
it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us . 
the movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality . 
with a confrontational stance , todd solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families . 
some people march to the beat of a different drum , and if you ever wondered what kind of houses those people live in , this documentary takes a look at 5 alternative housing options . 
entertaining despite its one-joke premise with the thesis that women from venus and men from mars can indeed get together . 
for most of its footage , the new thriller proves that director m . night shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and that mel gibson can gasp , shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo . 
even with all those rough edges safely sanded down , the american insomnia is still pretty darned good . 
the inevitable double- and triple-crosses arise , but the only drama is in waiting to hear how john malkovich's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line . 
this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached . 
though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed . . . that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr . schepisi's seems skimpy and unclear . 
it's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man clich� atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of [woo's] best work . 
another useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s american sports movie . 
the movie's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story . killing time , that's all that's going on here . 
it's a film that's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio's animated classics . 
it shares the first two films' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between . 
it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy . 
a moody horror/thriller elevated by deft staging and the director's well-known narrative gamesmanship . 
not for everyone , but for those with whom it will connect , it's a nice departure from standard moviegoing fare . 
well-meant but unoriginal . 
a fascinating documentary about the long and eventful spiritual journey of the guru who helped launch the new age . 
this is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie . 
the more you think about the movie , the more you will probably like it . 
incoherence reigns . 
you've already seen city by the sea under a variety of titles , but it's worth yet another visit . 
the immersive powers of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary space station 3d . 
if you're burnt out on it's a wonderful life marathons and bored with a christmas carol , it might just be the movie you're looking for . it depends on how well flatulence gags fit into your holiday concept . 
much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome clich� . 
part of the charm of satin rouge is that it avoids the obvious with humour and lightness . 
reggio and glass put on an intoxicating show . 
more intimate than spectacular , e . t . is carried less by wow factors than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades . 
the pace of the film is very slow ( for obvious reasons ) and that too becomes off-putting . 
it's as if you're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker . 
an impossible romance , but we root for the patronized iranian lad . 
the heart of the film is a touching reflection on aging , suffering and the prospect of death . 
gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance . 
a stirring , funny and finally transporting re-imagining of beauty and the beast and 1930s horror films
an interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama . 
this ludicrous film is predictable at every turn . 
expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery . 
 . . . a thoughtful what-if for the heart as well as the mind . 
there are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple doesn't mean you have to check your brain at the door . the same should go for movie theaters . 
put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob's body of work . 
a sad , superior human comedy played out on the back roads of life . 
even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy . . . even for disney . 
 . . . has freaky scenes where the crew wonder if they're ghosts imagining themselves as alive . it's a sly wink to the others without becoming a postmodern joke , made creepy by its " men in a sardine can " warped logic . 
while the story's undeniably hard to follow , iwai's gorgeous visuals seduce . 
finally , a genre movie that delivers -- in a couple of genres , no less . 
though nijinsky's words grow increasingly disturbed , the film maintains a beguiling serenity and poise that make it accessible for a non-narrative feature . 
too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility . 
frailty isn't as gory or explicit . but in its child-centered , claustrophobic context , it can be just as frightening and disturbing -- even punishing . 
rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the na�f's encounter with the world . 
a retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by martin scorsese . 
amazingly dopey . 
may take its sweet time to get wherever it's going , but if you have the patience for it , you won't feel like it's wasted yours . 
a sequel that's much too big for its britches .

with recent tensions rekindled by the kathleen soliah trial and the upcoming trial of sla members emily and william harris , not to mention sept . 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate fire's bright side . 
 . . . contains very few laughs and even less surprises . 
the fetid underbelly of fame has never looked uglier . 
trying to figure out the rules of the country bear universe -- when are bears bears and when are they like humans , only hairier -- would tax einstein's brain . 
its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time . 
elling really is about a couple of crazy guys , and it's therapeutic to laugh along with them . 
to blandly go where we went 8 movies ago . . . 
this follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric peter . 
absurdities and clich�s accumulate like lint in a fat man's navel . 
the wild thornberrys movie is a jolly surprise . 
this isn't a stand up and cheer flick ; it's a sit down and ponder affair . and thanks to kline's superbly nuanced performance , that pondering is highly pleasurable . 
a movie that , rather than skip along the seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek . 
while there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics ) , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor . 
a rare and lightly entertaining look behind the curtain that separates comics from the people laughing in the crowd . 
it's also clear from the start that the transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film's shortcomings start to shine through . 
just like every other seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail . 
there's a disturbing 'great white hope' undertone to the other side of heaven that subtly undermines its message of christian love and compassion . 
a hugely rewarding experience that's every bit as enlightening , insightful and entertaining as grant's two best films -- four weddings and a funeral and bridget jones's diary . 
a rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics . 
warm in its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction of everyday people , relaxed in its perfect quiet pace and proud in its message . i loved this film . 
in spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice . 
more successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine
reggio's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad . 
the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises . 
solid , lump-in-the-throat family entertainment that derives its power by sticking to the facts . 
a riveting documentary . 
the story is so light and sugary that were it a macy's thanksgiving day parade balloon , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away . 
[stevens is] so stoked to make an important film about human infidelity and happenstance that he tosses a kitchen sink onto a story already overladen with plot conceits .

but this is not a movie about an inhuman monster ; it's about a very human one .

an imaginative comedy/thriller . 
playfully profound . . . and crazier than michael jackson on the top floor of a skyscraper nursery surrounded by open windows . 
the film becomes an overwhelming pleasure , and you find yourself rooting for gai's character to avoid the fate that has befallen every other carmen before her . 
a deceivingly simple film , one that grows in power in retrospect . 
deserves a place of honor next to nanook as a landmark in film history . 
none of his actors stand out , but that's less of a problem here than it would be in another film : characterization matters less than atmosphere . 
if reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum , her tough , funny , rather chaotic show isn't subversive so much as it is nit-picky about the hypocrisies of our time . 
it's got the brawn , but not the brains . 
it's a rare window on an artistic collaboration . 
there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that don't care about being stupid
so genial is the conceit , this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout , dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen . it never is , not fully . 
 . . . the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity . 
a processed comedy chop suey . 
the film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but ram dass : fierce grace doesn't organize it with any particular insight . 
sillier , cuter , and shorter than the first ( as best i remember ) , but still a very good time at the cinema . 
it has its faults , but it is a kind , unapologetic , sweetheart of a movie , and mandy moore leaves a positive impression . 
thanks to a small star with big heart , this family film sequel is plenty of fun for all . 
a creaky staircase gothic . 
taken outside the context of the current political climate ( see : terrorists are more evil than ever ! ) , the sum of all fears is simply a well-made and satisfying thriller .

in his debut as a film director , denzel washington delivers a lean and engaging work . 
dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery . 
the impulses that produced this project . . . are commendable , but the results are uneven .

the film often achieves a mesmerizing poetry . 
i wish windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story . this would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes .

[a]n utterly charming and hilarious film that reminded me of the best of the disney comedies from the 60s . 
works better in the conception than it does in the execution . . . winds up seeming just a little too clever .

 . . . a bland , pretentious mess . 
serving sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it .

a sly dissection of the inanities of the contemporary music business and a rather sad story of the difficulties of artistic collaboration . 
one hour photo may seem disappointing in its generalities , but it's the little nuances that perhaps had to escape from director mark romanek's self-conscious scrutiny to happen , that finally get under your skin .

i felt trapped and with no obvious escape for the entire 100 minutes .

a savage john waters-like humor that dances on the edge of tastelessness without ever quite falling over .

a headline-fresh thriller set among orthodox jews on the west bank , joseph cedar's time of favor manages not only to find a compelling dramatic means of addressing a complex situation , it does so without compromising that complexity . 
its adult themes of familial separation and societal betrayal are head and shoulders above much of the director's previous popcorn work . 
like the film's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early-'80s suburbia , it's significant without being overstated . 
even if you've seen " stomp " ( the stage show ) , you still have to see this ! 
first-time writer-director dylan kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people . 
peter jackson and company once again dazzle and delight us , fulfilling practically every expectation either a longtime tolkien fan or a movie-going neophyte could want . 
it's the kind of movie that , aside from robert altman , spike lee , the coen brothers and a few others , our moviemakers don't make often enough . 
it's all about anakin . . . and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect . 
as self-aware movies go , who is cletis tout ? is clever enough , though thin writing proves its undoing .

what might have been acceptable on the printed page of iles' book does not translate well to the screen . 
jaunty fun , with its celeb-strewn backdrop well used . 
ms . fulford-wierzbicki is almost spooky in her sulky , calculating lolita turn . 
i'm not sure which half of dragonfly is worse : the part where nothing's happening , or the part where something's happening , but it's stupid . 
it offers a glimpse of the solomonic decision facing jewish parents in those turbulent times : to save their children and yet to lose them . 
a sweet-natured reconsideration of one of san francisco's most vital , if least widely recognized , creative fountainheads . 
wildly incompetent but brilliantly named half past dead -- or for seagal pessimists : totally past his prime . 
this is an extraordinary film , not least because it is japanese and yet feels universal . 
it's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter . 
it's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction . 
even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission's worth of funny to keep it afloat . 
lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child's interest and an adult's patience . but it also has many of the things that made the first one charming . 
it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that . 
while american adobo has its heart ( and its palate ) in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even . 
led by griffin's smartly nuanced performance and enthusiasm , the cast has a lot of fun with the material . 
men in black ii has sequel-itis something fierce . an ungainly , comedy-deficient , b-movie rush job . . . 
writer-director david jacobson and his star , jeremy renner , have made a remarkable film that explores the monster's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted . 
this picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer . 
anyone who can count to five ( the film's target market ? ) can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going . 
the powers team has fashioned a comedy with more laughs than many , no question . but this time there's some mold on the gold . 
cuba gooding jr . valiantly mugs his way through snow dogs , but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy . 
sad nonsense , this . but not without cheesy fun factor . 
starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera . 
smart science fiction for grown-ups , with only a few false steps along the way . 
an intriguing and entertaining introduction to johnson . 
it's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period . 
a smart , sassy and exceptionally charming romantic comedy . 
despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , super troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development . 
returning director rob minkoff . . . and screenwriter bruce joel rubin . . . have done a fine job of updating white's dry wit to a new age . 
everything's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull . 
walter hill's undisputed is like a 1940s warner bros . b picture , and i mean that as a compliment . 
despite modest aspirations its occasional charms are not to be dismissed . 
to the film's credit , the acting is fresh and unselfconscious , and munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment . 
could use a little more humanity , but it never lacks in eye-popping visuals . 
the universal theme of becoming a better person through love has never been filmed more irresistibly than in 'baran . '
meandering , sub-aquatic mess : it's so bad it's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie . 
but this is lohman's film . her performance moves between heartbreak and rebellion as she continually tries to accommodate to fit in and gain the unconditional love she seeks . 
[shyamalan] turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count . 
it's hard not to be seduced by [witherspoon's] charisma , even in this run-of-the-mill vehicle , because this girl knows how to drive it to the max . 
demands too much of most viewers . 
the whole mildly pleasant outing -- the r rating is for brief nudity and a grisly corpse -- remains aloft not on its own self-referential hot air , but on the inspired performance of tim allen . 
is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic hong kong action aesthetic ? 
dazzling in its complexity , disturbing for its extraordinary themes , the piano teacher is a film that defies categorisation . it haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away . ah yes , and then there's the music . . . 
 . . . there's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise . 
 " extreme ops " exceeds expectations . good fun , good action , good acting , good dialogue , good pace , good cinematography . 
occasionally funny and consistently odd , and it works reasonably well as a star vehicle for zhao . 
when it's not wallowing in hormonal melodrama , " real women have curves " is a sweet , honest , and enjoyable comedy-drama about a young woman who wants many things in life , but fears she'll become her mother before she gets to fulfill her dreams . 
two generations within one family test boundaries in this intelligent and restrained coming-of-age drama . 
while it's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own . 
about as big a crowdpleaser as they possibly come . 
oh , it's extreme , all right . extremely dumb . extremely confusing . extremely boring . 
contrived as this may sound , mr . rose's updating works surprisingly well . 
cho's latest comic set isn't as sharp or as fresh as i'm the one that i want . . . but it's still damn funny stuff . 
sensual , funny and , in the end , very touching . 
high crimes knows the mistakes that bad movies make and is determined not to make them , and maybe that is nobility of a sort . 
there must be an audience that enjoys the friday series , but i wouldn't be interested in knowing any of them personally . 
in the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a r�sum� loaded with credits like " girl in bar 
jackson is always watchable . 
who knows what exactly godard is on about in this film , but his words and images don't have to add up to mesmerize you . 
an uplifting , near-masterpiece . 
tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar . 
the movie's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh . 
ferrara's best film in years . 
even if you don't think [kissinger's] any more guilty of criminal activity than most contemporary statesmen , he'd sure make a courtroom trial great fun to watch . 
the script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few . 
would've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film's predictable denouement . then nadia's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all . 
a compelling portrait of moral emptiness
it's about individual moments of mood , and an aimlessness that's actually sort of amazing . 
bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as spider-man does to the experiences of most teenagers . 
starts off with a bang , but then fizzles like a wet stick of dynamite at the very end . it's still worth a look . 
a stirring tribute to the bravery and dedication of the world's reporters who willingly walk into the nightmare of war not only to record the events for posterity , but to help us clearly see the world of our making . 
by turns touching , raucously amusing , uncomfortable , and , yes , even sexy , never again is a welcome and heartwarming addition to the romantic comedy genre . 
likely to expertly drum up repressed teenage memories in any viewer . 
you'll get the enjoyable basic minimum . but not a whit more . 
though in some ways similar to catherine breillat's fat girl , rain is the far superior film . 
a glib but bouncy bit of sixties-style slickness in which the hero might wind up caught but the audience gets pure escapism . 
[two] fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now . 
the master of disguise represents adam sandler's latest attempt to dumb down the universe . 
the pairing does sound promising in theory . . . but their lack of chemistry makes eddie murphy and robert deniro in showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners . 
wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own . 
too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story wouldn't work without all those gimmicks . 
the whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey . . . [it] comes off like a hallmark commercial . 
drops you into a dizzying , volatile , pressure-cooker of a situation that quickly snowballs out of control , while focusing on the what much more than the why . 
looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights . 
the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious . 
yeah , these flicks are just that damn good . isn't it great ? 
on the surface a silly comedy , scotland , pa would be forgettable if it weren't such a clever adaptation of the bard's tragic play . 
it's a fun adventure movie for kids ( of all ages ) that like adventure . 
i'm convinced i could keep a family of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking . 
we can't accuse kung pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie . unfortunately , we'd prefer a simple misfire . 
the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington's fine performance in the title role . 
lame sweet home leaves no southern stereotype unturned . 
provides a very moving and revelatory footnote to the holocaust . 
it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) . 
some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being . 
an invaluable historical document thanks to the filmmaker's extraordinary access to massoud , whose charm , cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent . 
clever , brutal and strangely soulful movie . 
a comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis . 
it is quite a vision . 
all in all , brown sugar is a satisfying well-made romantic comedy that's both charming and well acted . it will guarantee to have you leaving the theater with a smile on your face . 
i could have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again . 
blanchett's performance confirms her power once again . 
memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual . 
does what a fine documentary does best : it extends a warm invitation into an unfamiliar world , then illuminates it fully and allows the larger implications of the journey to sink in unobtrusively . 
a portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers . 
 . . . a magnificent drama well worth tracking down . 
keenly observed and refreshingly natural , swimming gets the details right , from its promenade of barely clad bodies in myrtle beach , s . c . , to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner . 
the director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in [the characters'] misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it . 
michael gerbosi's script is economically packed with telling scenes . 
it's a fairy tale that comes from a renowned indian film culture that allows americans to finally revel in its splendor . 
marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie . 
barely goes beyond comic book status . 
a hard look at one man's occupational angst and its subsequent reinvention , a terrifying study of bourgeois desperation worthy of claude chabrol . 
less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession . 
one of the best rock documentaries ever . wilco is a phenomenal band with such an engrossing story that will capture the minds and hearts of many . 
works because , for the most part , it avoids the stupid cliches and formulaic potholes that befall its brethren . 
there's very little sense to what's going on here , but the makers serve up the cliches with considerable dash . 
the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit . 
the visuals alone make metropolis worth seeing . 
the good thing -- the only good thing -- about extreme ops is that it's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my thanksgiving to-do list . 
much of this slick and sprightly cgi feature is sufficiently funny to amuse even the most resolutely unreligious parents who escort their little ones to megaplex screenings . 
the real charm of this trifle is the deadpan comic face of its star , jean reno , who resembles sly stallone in a hot sake half-sleep . 
after making several adaptations of other writers' work , armenian-canadian director atom egoyan broached an original treatment of a deeply personal subject . 
compared to his series of spectacular belly flops both on and off the screen , runteldat is something of a triumph . 
sly , sophisticated and surprising . 
just a kiss is a just a waste . 
there is no solace here , no entertainment value , merely a fierce lesson in where filmmaking can take us . 
while hoffman's performance is great , the subject matter goes nowhere . 
although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful . 
i wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways . 
the movie is pretty funny now and then without in any way demeaning its subjects . 
piccoli's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm's-length in the film seem irritatingly transparent . 
impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie doesn't quite fly . for starters , the story is just too slim . 
miller has crafted an intriguing story of maternal instincts and misguided acts of affection . 
malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain . but the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure . 
none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . 
meyjes . . . has done his homework and soaked up some jazzy new revisionist theories about the origins of nazi politics and aesthetics . 
a coarse and stupid gross-out . 
the latest vapid actor's exercise to appropriate the structure of arthur schnitzler's reigen . 
mctiernan's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious . 
complex , affecting and uniquely almod�var , the film evokes strong emotions and pushes viewers to question their deepest notions of moral right and wrong . 
can't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers . still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral . 
bring on the sequel . 
if the real-life story is genuinely inspirational , the movie stirs us as well . 
what saves it . . . and makes it one of the better video-game-based flicks , is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense , such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist alice . 
both the crime story and the love story are unusual . but they don't fit well together and neither is well told . 
watching spirited away is like watching an eastern imagination explode . 
 . . . strips bible stores of the potential for sanctimoniousness , making them meaningful for both kids and church-wary adults . 
there is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine . 
the x potion gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately don't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays . 
too much power , not enough puff . 
at its best . . . festival in cannes bubbles with the excitement of the festival in cannes . 
adrift , bentley and hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design . 
for the most part , it works beautifully as a movie without sacrificing the integrity of the opera . 
shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating patch adams , trots out every ghost trick from the sixth sense to the mothman prophecies . 
a very depressing movie of many missed opportunities . 
an endlessly fascinating , landmark movie that is as bold as anything the cinema has seen in years . 
succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the police academy series . 
this is a fascinating film because there is no clear-cut hero and no all-out villain . 
it is too bad that this likable movie isn't more accomplished . the actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward . 
offers the flash of rock videos fused with solid performances and eerie atmosphere . 
formula 51 is so trite that even yu's high-energy action stylings can't break through the stupor . 
a little weak -- and it isn't that funny . 
a gushy episode of " m * a * s * h " only this time from an asian perspective . 
just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience . 
the film runs on equal parts of innocence and wisdom -- wisdom that comes with experience . it has fun being grown up . 
victor rosa is leguizamo's best movie work so far , a subtle and richly internalized performance . 
using a stock plot , about a boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater . 
if the plot seems a bit on the skinny side , that's because panic room is interested in nothing more than sucking you in�and making you sweat . 
a bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at times , but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that french realism . 
hailed as a clever exercise in neo-hitchcockianism , this clever and very satisfying picture is more accurately chabrolian . 
the movie's vision of a white american zealously spreading a puritanical brand of christianity to south seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish . 
with its hint of an awkward hitchcockian theme in tact , harmon's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone
in its understanding , often funny way , it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation . 
the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year . 
there's no conversion effort , much of the writing is genuinely witty and both stars are appealing enough to probably have a good shot at a hollywood career , if they want one . 
slight but enjoyable documentary . 
the movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts . 
has not so much been written as assembled , frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups . 
a great script brought down by lousy direction . same guy with both hats . big mistake . 
the genius of the work speaks volumes , offering up a hallucinatory dreamscape that frustrates and captivates . 
'pocas veces es posible ver un elenco tan compenetrado con la historia , donde todos y cada uno de los actores ofrecen actuaciones verdaderamente memorables . '
this is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground . 
lan yu is a genuine love story , full of traditional layers of awakening and ripening and separation and recovery . 
the film exudes the urbane sweetness that woody allen seems to have bitterly forsaken . 
coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story . 
excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic . 
some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic . 
 " looking for leonard " just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something . 
if the message seems more facile than the earlier films , the images have such a terrible beauty you may not care . 
it takes this never-ending confusion and hatred , puts a human face on it , evokes shame among all who are party to it and even promotes understanding . 
originality ain't on the menu , but there's never a dull moment in the giant spider invasion comic chiller . 
this film puts wang at the forefront of china's sixth generation of film makers . 
despite hoffman's best efforts , wilson remains a silent , lumpish cipher ; his encounters reveal nothing about who he is or who he was before . 
rarely , a movie is more than a movie . go . 
it's plotless , shapeless -- and yet , it must be admitted , not entirely humorless . indeed , the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost dadaist proportions . 
grating and tedious . 
hoffman notches in the nuances of pain , but his smart , edgy voice and waddling profile ( emphasized here ) accent the humor of wilson's plight , and that saves his pathos from drippiness . 
it's a tour de force , written and directed so quietly that it's implosion rather than explosion you fear . 
i'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about . 
as original and insightful as last week's episode of behind the music . 
for devotees of french cinema , safe conduct is so rich with period minutiae it's like dying and going to celluloid heaven . 
as literary desecrations go , this makes for perfectly acceptable , occasionally very enjoyable children's entertainment . you'll forget about it by monday , though , and if they're old enough to have developed some taste , so will your kids . 
[swimfan] falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting . 
this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob's excellent adventure seem understated . 
beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce . . . lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments . 
a recent favourite at sundance , this white-trash satire will inspire the affection of even those unlucky people who never owned a cassette of def leppard's pyromania . 
when compared to the usual , more somber festival entries , davis' highly personal brand of romantic comedy is a tart , smart breath of fresh air that stands out from the pack even if the picture itself is somewhat problematic . 
offers an unusual opportunity to observe the inequities in the death penalty , not just the inherent immorality but also the haphazard administration of it and public misperception of how the whole thing works . 
not counting a few gross-out comedies i've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes . 
exhilarating but blatantly biased . 
mostly martha could have used a little trimming -- 10 or 15 minutes could be cut and no one would notice -- but it's a pleasurable trifle . the only pain you'll feel as the credits roll is your stomach grumbling for some tasty grub . 
a pleasurably jacked-up piece of action moviemaking . 
 . . . a solid , well-formed satire . 
a pleasant piece of escapist entertainment . 
the movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it weren't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension . 
the re-release of ron howard's apollo 13 in the imax format proves absolutely that really , really , really good things can come in enormous packages . 
it rapidly develops into a gut-wrenching examination of the way cultural differences and emotional expectations collide . 
it provides an honest look at a community striving to anchor itself in new grounds . 
it further declares its director , zhang yang of shower , as a boldly experimental , contemporary stylist with a bright future . 
the low-key direction is pleasingly emphatic in this properly intense , claustrophobic tale of obsessive love . 
visually fascinating . . . an often intense character study about fathers and sons , loyalty and duty . 
there's little to recommend snow dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity . 
 . . . a spoof comedy that carries its share of laughs � sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , the occasional belly laugh . 
the film doesn't sustain its initial promise with a jarring , new-agey tone creeping into the second half
neither parker nor donovan is a typical romantic lead , but they bring a fresh , quirky charm to the formula . 
[fincher's] camera sense and assured pacing make it an above-average thriller . 
i can't remember the last time i saw an audience laugh so much during a movie , but there's only one problem�it's supposed to be a drama . 
there are laughs aplenty , and , as a bonus , viewers don't have to worry about being subjected to farts , urine , feces , semen , or any of the other foul substances that have overrun modern-day comedies . 
flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up . 
its well of thorn and vinegar ( and simple humanity ) has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks . 
all of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director george hickenlooper's approach to the material is too upbeat . 
if this is satire , it's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook . 
mixes likeable personalities , inventive photography and cutting , and wall-to-wall toe-tapping music to paint a picture of a subculture that is at once exhilarating , silly , perverse , hopeful and always fun . 
what makes it worth watching is quaid's performance . 
needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey . 
japan's premier stylist of sex and blood hits audiences with what may be his most demented film to date . 
it's a great american adventure and a wonderful film to bring to imax . 
a selection of scenes in search of a movie . 
make like the title and dodge this one . 
life or something like it has its share of high points , but it misses too many opportunities . 
it tends to remind one of a really solid woody allen film , with its excellent use of new york locales and sharp writing
while the resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these . 
ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year's best acting , personal velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum . 
 . . . while each moment of this broken character study is rich in emotional texture , the journey doesn't really go anywhere . 
marinated in clich�s and mawkish dialogue . 
bourne , jason bourne . he can scale a building like a super hero , he can out-stealth any agent , he'll get the girl . he's super spy ! 
sweet home alabama is one dumb movie , but its stupidity is so relentlessly harmless that it almost wins you over in the end . 
it's so badly made on every level that i'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it . 
outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent . 
knows how to make our imagination wonder . 
nicole holofcener's lovely and amazing , from her own screenplay , jumps to the head of the class of women's films that manage to avoid the ghetto of sentimental chick-flicks by treating female follies with a satirical style . 
it's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay . 
a relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty world war ii action flick . 
a powerful , chilling , and affecting study of one man's dying fall . 
personal velocity ought to be exploring these women's inner lives , but it never moves beyond their surfaces . 
while undisputed isn't exactly a high , it is a gripping , tidy little movie that takes mr . hill higher than he's been in a while . 
feels untidily honest . 
leigh's film is full of memorable performances from top to bottom . 
passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes . for me , this opera isn't a favorite , so it's a long time before the fat lady sings . 
dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled . 
unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications . vulgar is too optimistic a title . 
the furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing . 
[tries] to parody a genre that's already a joke in the united states . the movie is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay . 
these characters are so well established that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field , and i'm all for that . 
for all its problems . . . the lady and the duke surprisingly manages never to grow boring . . . which proves that rohmer still has a sense of his audience . 
brosnan is more feral in this film than i've seen him before and halle berry does her best to keep up with him . 
the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . 
tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters , its sensitive acting , its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer hilary birmingham . 
this harrowing journey into combat hell vividly captures the chaotic insanity and personal tragedies that are all too abundant when human hatred spews forth unchecked . 
gets under the skin of a man who has just lost his wife . 
chicago is , in many ways , an admirable achievement . 
though there are many tense scenes in trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful . 
the film is an enjoyable family film -- pretty much aimed at any youngster who loves horses . 
for those for whom the name woody allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , hollywood ending is a depressing experience
i'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence : this erotic cannibal movie is boring . 
vera's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them . 
when a movie asks you to feel sorry for mick jagger's sex life , it already has one strike against it . 
what " empire " lacks in depth it makes up for with its heart . 
while the mystery unravels , the characters respond by hitting on each other . 
so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style . 
odd and weird . 
animated drivel meant to enhance the self-image of drooling idiots . 
a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy . 
the wild thornberrys movie has all the sibling rivalry and general family chaos to which anyone can relate . 
chamber of secrets will find millions of eager fans . but if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie . 
like a precious and finely cut diamond , magnificent to behold in its sparkling beauty yet in reality it's one tough rock . 
the beautifully choreographed kitchen ballet is simple but absorbing . 
 . . . is funny in the way that makes you ache with sadness ( the way chekhov is funny ) , profound without ever being self-important , warm without ever succumbing to sentimentality . 
bluer than the atlantic and more biologically detailed than an autopsy , the movie . . . is , also , frequently hilarious . 
they should have called it gutterball . 
khouri manages , with terrific flair , to keep the extremes of screwball farce and blood-curdling family intensity on one continuum . 
places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller . 
[city] reminds us how realistically nuanced a robert de niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of 'analyze this' ( 1999 ) and 'analyze that , ' promised ( or threatened ) for later this year . 
worth watching for dong jie's performance -- and for the way it documents a culture in the throes of rapid change . 
[carvey's] characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark . 
i've always dreamed of attending cannes , but after seeing this film , it's not that big a deal . 
[a] soulless , stupid sequel . . . 
beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart . it really is a shame that more won't get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet 'evelyn . '
it's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex . 
this may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other holocaust films , but it's a compelling story , mainly because of the way it's told by the people who were there . 
a rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel . 
call this the full monty on ice , the underdog sports team formula redux . 
move over bond ; this girl deserves a sequel . 
the project's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger fatal attraction into a high school setting . 
[chaiken's] talent lies in an evocative , accurate observation of a distinctive milieu and in the lively , convincing dialogue she creates for her characters . 
it is ok for a movie to be something of a sitcom apparatus , if the lines work , the humor has point and the actors are humanly engaged . 
long time dead ? not nearly long enough . 
and if you appreciate the one-sided theme to lawrence's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified martin lawrence lovefest . if you are willing to do this , then you so crazy ! 
while benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that . 
with lesser talents , high crimes would be entertaining , but forgettable . with freeman and judd , i'll at least remember their characters . 
why spend $9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ? 
if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title . 
the magic of the film lies not in the mysterious spring but in the richness of its performances . 
uplifting as only a document of the worst possibilities of mankind can be , and among the best films of the year . 
loud , chaotic and largely unfunny . 
a treat for its depiction on not giving up on dreams when you're a struggling nobody . 
the characters are interesting and the relationship between yosuke and saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there's not enough to the story to fill two hours . 
[hayek] throws herself into this dream hispanic role with a teeth-clenching gusto , she strikes a potent chemistry with molina and she gradually makes us believe she is kahlo . 
sucking all the 'classic' out of robert louis stevenson's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst . . . 
chouraqui brings documentary-like credibility to the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of 'ethnic cleansing . '
the sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste . 
watching this gentle , mesmerizing portrait of a man coming to terms with time , you barely realize your mind is being blown . 
this will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things . 
the best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast . 
the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why . 
there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes . 
while not quite a comedy , the film tackles its relatively serious subject with an open mind and considerable good cheer , and is never less than engaging . 
this film biggest problem ? no laughs . 
national lampoon's van wilder may aim to be the next animal house , but it more closely resembles this year's version of tomcats . 
this director's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera . 
the story gives ample opportunity for large-scale action and suspense , which director shekhar kapur supplies with tremendous skill . 
i'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on johnny knoxville's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche . 
exudes the fizz of a busby berkeley musical and the visceral excitement of a sports extravaganza . 
there's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present . 
to those who have not read the book , the film is a much better mother-daughter tale than last summer's 'divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood , ' but that's not saying much . 
the usual movie rah-rah , pleasantly and predictably delivered in low-key style by director michael apted and writer tom stoppard . 
the film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next . 
the biggest problem with roger avary's uproar against the mpaa is that , even in all its director's cut glory , he's made a film that's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything . 
andy garcia enjoys one of his richest roles in years and mick jagger gives his best movie performance since , well , performance . 
as if trying to grab a lump of play-doh , the harder that liman tries to squeeze his story , the more details slip out between his fingers . 
strange it is , but delightfully so . 
demonstrates a vivid imagination and an impressive style that result in some terrific setpieces . 
occasionally melodramatic , it's also extremely effective . 
barely gets off the ground . 
a triumph of art direction over narrative , but what art direction ! 
the solid filmmaking and convincing characters makes this a high water mark for this genre . 
it has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame . 
all in all , it's a pretty good execution of a story that's a lot richer than the ones hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own . 
clayburgh and tambor are charming performers ; neither of them deserves eric schaeffer . 
it's enough to watch huppert scheming , with her small , intelligent eyes as steady as any noir villain , and to enjoy the perfectly pitched web of tension that chabrol spins . 
watching this film , one is left with the inescapable conclusion that hitchens' obsession with kissinger is , at bottom , a sophisticated flower child's desire to purge the world of the tooth and claw of human power . 
it's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role . 
you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production . 
mazel tov to a film about a family's joyous life acting on the yiddish stage . 
it's of the quality of a lesser harrison ford movie - six days , seven nights , maybe , or that dreadful sabrina remake . 
the movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there's just not much lurking below its abstract surface . 
dreary tale of middle-class angst
forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending . 
when you think you've figured out bielinsky's great game , that's when you're in the most trouble : he's the con , and you're just the mark . 
just not campy enough
the only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies . 
go see it and enjoy . 
a zombie movie in every sense of the word--mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious . 
a touching , small-scale story of family responsibility and care in the community . 
there's nothing like love to give a movie a b-12 shot , and cq shimmers with it . 
it understands , in a way that speaks forcefully enough about the mechanisms of poverty to transcend the rather simplistic filmmaking . 
horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the serbs themselves but also to a network of american right-wing extremists . 
light years/ several warp speeds/ levels and levels of dilithium crystals better than the pitiful insurrection . which isn't to say that it's the equal of some of its predecessors . 
it's endlessly inventive , consistently intelligent and sickeningly savage . 
i have no way of knowing exactly how much is exaggeration , but i've got a creepy feeling that the film is closer to the mark than i want to believe . 
the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in chinese history : war , revolution , communism , etc . 
a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary . 
a little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon wedding serves mostly to whet one's appetite for the bollywood films . 
fancy a real downer ? [leigh] lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race . 
if it tried to do anything more , it would fail and perhaps explode , but at this level of manic whimsy , it is just about right . 
the only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team . 
it's sweet , funny , charming , and completely delightful . 
with a romantic comedy plotline straight from the ages , this cinderella story doesn't have a single surprise up its sleeve . but it does somehow manage to get you under its spell . 
in scope , ambition and accomplishment , children of the century . . . takes kurys' career to a whole new level . 
a particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale . 
an asian neo-realist treasure . 
a dreary indulgence . 
strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild . 
quite frankly , i can't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out . 
some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth . 
an important movie , a reminder of the power of film to move us and to make us examine our values . 
the story , like life , refuses to be simple , and the result is a compelling slice of awkward emotions . 
these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining . 
call me a cynic , but there's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message . 
amid the new populist comedies that underscore the importance of family tradition and familial community , one would be hard-pressed to find a movie with a bigger , fatter heart than barbershop . 
from its invitingly upbeat overture to its pathos-filled but ultimately life-affirming finale , martin is a masterfully conducted work . 
84 minutes of rolling musical back beat and supercharged cartoon warfare . it's also , clearly , great fun . 
it would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi . 
provide[s] nail-biting suspense and credible characters without relying on technology-of-the-moment technique or pretentious dialogue . 
those outside show business will enjoy a close look at people they don't really want to know . 
it's more enjoyable than i expected , though , and that's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs . cinematic pratfalls given a working over . the cast is spot on and the mood is laid back . 
where the film falters is in its tone . 
no amount of nostalgia for carvey's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey's considerable talents are wasted in it . 
provides a satisfactory overview of the bizarre world of extreme athletes as several daredevils express their own views . 
a meditation on faith and madness , frailty is blood-curdling stuff . 
its engaging simplicity is driven by appealing leads . 
a tour de force of modern cinema . 
an already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent anti-virus . if only there were one for this kind of movie . 
nothing short of a masterpiece -- and a challenging one . 
i hated every minute of it . 
all but the most persnickety preteens should enjoy this nonthreatening but thrilling adventure . 
despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings . 
some movies are like a tasty hors-d'oeuvre ; this one is a feast . 
much has been written about those years when the psychedelic '60s grooved over into the gay '70s , but words don't really do the era justice . you have to see it . 
if you love motown music , you'll love this documentary . 
although commentary on nachtwey is provided . . . it's the image that really tells the tale . 
visually , 'santa clause 2' is wondrously creative . 
star/producer salma hayek and director julie taymor have infused frida with a visual style unique and inherent to the titular character's paintings and in the process created a masterful work of art of their own . 
there's so much to look at in metropolis you hate to tear your eyes away from the images long enough to read the subtitles . 
when the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence . 
in capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever-ruminating , genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills , the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st . 
i couldn't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy . 
faithful without being forceful , sad without being shrill , " a walk to remember " succeeds through sincerity . 
with tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool . 
it's not too fast and not too slow . it's not too racy and it's not too offensive . it's not too much of anything . 
' . . . the film's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . '
an off-beat and fanciful film about the human need for monsters to blame for all that is amiss in the world . 
personal velocity has a no-frills docu-dogma plainness , yet miller lingers on invisible , nearly psychic nuances , leaping into digressions of memory and desire . she boxes these women's souls right open for us . 
 with one exception , every blighter in this particular south london housing project digs into dysfunction like it's a big , comforting jar of marmite , to be slathered on crackers and served as a feast of bleakness . 
it's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate . 
many of benjamins' elements feel like they've been patched in from an episode of miami vice . 
moving and vibrant . 
that neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks . 
does paint some memorable images . . . , but makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
 . . . an interesting slice of history . 
dark and unrepentant , this excursion into the epicenter of percolating mental instability is not easily dismissed or forgotten . 
it's obviously struck a responsive chord with many south koreans , and should work its magic in other parts of the world . 
the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes . 
the satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere . 
more concerned with overall feelings , broader ideas , and open-ended questions than concrete story and definitive answers , soderbergh's solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem . 
there are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies . 
the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary . 
feels as if the inmates have actually taken over the asylum . 
a pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort . 
the talk-heavy film plays like one of robert altman's lesser works . 
it's [ricci's] best work yet , this girl-woman who sincerely believes she can thwart the world's misery with blind good will . 
 . . . post-september 11 , " the sum of all fears " seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves . 
one of the most slyly exquisite anti-adult movies ever made . 
don't even bother to rent this on video . 
the film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of america's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get . 
the very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary . 
the script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks . 
fluffy and disposible . 
the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness . 
while the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation . 
the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take . 
frida's artistic brilliance is undeniable -- it's among the most breathtakingly designed films i've ever seen . 
mildly entertaining . 
becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the papin sisters . 
at once subtle and visceral , the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful , offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future . 
remember when bond had more glamour than clamor ? no more . 
what's most refreshing about real women have curves is its unforced comedy-drama and its relaxed , natural-seeming actors . 
the powerful success of read my lips with such provocative material shows why , after only three films , director/co-writer jacques audiard , though little known in this country , belongs in the very top rank of french filmmakers . 
its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie's presentation , which is way too stagy . 
the jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail . 
be patient with the lovely hush ! and your reward will be a thoughtful , emotional movie experience . 
at times , however , dogtown and z-boys lapses into an insider's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about . 
isn't it a bit early in his career for director barry sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ? and it's a lousy one at that . 
feeble comedy . 
decent but dull . 
an awkward and indigestible movie . 
a journey that's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which hoffman's brilliance almost makes worth taking . 
less worrying about covering all the drama in frida's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie . 
proves mainly that south korean filmmakers can make undemanding action movies with all the alacrity of their hollywood counterparts . 
either a fascinating study of the relationship between mothers and their children or a disturbing story about sociopaths and their marks . 
don't judge this one too soon - it's a dark , gritty story but it takes off in totally unexpected directions and keeps on going . 
i think it was plato who said , 'i think , therefore i know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . '
the continued good chemistry between carmen and juni is what keeps this slightly disappointing sequel going , with enough amusing banter -- blessedly curse-free -- to keep both kids and parents entertained . 
ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay . 
it may scream low budget , but this charmer has a spirit that cannot be denied . 
writer-director burger imaginatively fans the embers of a dormant national grief and curiosity that has calcified into chronic cynicism and fear . 
[t]his slop doesn't even have potential as a cult film , as it's too loud to shout insults at the screen . 
there's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , but brooms isn't it . 
this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay . 
 . . . the first 2/3 of the film are incredibly captivating and insanely funny , thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices ( cool visual backmasking ) , a solid cast , and some wickedly sick and twisted humor . . . 
i am more offended by his lack of faith in his audience than by anything on display here . 
it's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best 'old neighborhood' project since christopher walken kinda romanced cyndi lauper in the opportunists . 
it's just a little too self-satisfied . 
a delightful entree in the tradition of food movies . 
it leaves little doubt that kidman has become one of our best actors . 
on this tricky topic , tadpole is very much a step in the right direction , with its blend of frankness , civility and compassion . 
while tattoo borrows heavily from both seven and the silence of the lambs , it manages to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human-scale characters that suck the audience in . 
the movie doesn't generate a lot of energy . it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously . 
jones . . . does offer a brutal form of charisma . 
 . . . a quietly introspective portrait of the self-esteem of employment and the shame of losing a job . . . 
director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself . 
focuses on joan's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with spanish inquisitions about her " madness " so much that i became mad that i wasted 123 minutes and $9 . 50 on this 21st century torture device . 
too often , son of the bride becomes an exercise in trying to predict when a preordained " big moment " will occur and not " if . " 
a cruelly funny twist on teen comedy packed with inventive cinematic tricks and an ironically killer soundtrack
the nicest thing that can be said about stealing harvard ( which might have been called freddy gets molested by a dog ) is that it's not as obnoxious as tom green's freddie got fingered . 
at times funny and at other times candidly revealing , it's an intriguing look at two performers who put themselves out there because they love what they do . 
an affable but undernourished romantic comedy that fails to match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer's previous collaboration , miss congeniality . 
this is a good script , good dialogue , funny even for adults . the characters are interesting and often very creatively constructed from figure to backstory . the film will play equally well on both the standard and giant screens . 
a teasing drama whose relentless good-deed/bad-deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting , less symmetrical , less obviously cross-shaped creation . 
the master of disguise is awful . it's pauly shore awful . don't say you weren't warned . 
hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors , but it doesn't . 
while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s . goyer is much sillier . 
you . . . get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone . 
enduring love but exhausting cinema . 
i prefer soderbergh's concentration on his two lovers over tarkovsky's mostly male , mostly patriarchal debating societies . 
it sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that's more or less how it plays out . 
each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time . 
ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy . if there ain't none , you have a problem . 
with its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clich�s . 
like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen . 
if you're the kind of parent who enjoys intentionally introducing your kids to films which will cause loads of irreparable damage that years and years of costly analysis could never fix , i have just one word for you -� decasia
it won't hold up over the long haul , but in the moment , finch's tale provides the forgettable pleasures of a saturday matinee . 
the wonder of mostly martha is the performance of gedeck , who makes martha enormously endearing . 
a painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots . 
constantly slips from the grasp of its maker . 
light the candles , bring out the cake and don't fret about the calories because there's precious little substance in birthday girl -- it's simply , and surprisingly , a nice , light treat . 
no aspirations to social import inform the movie version . this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars . 
the film is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits , headed by christopher plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work . 
turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film's characters
an allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals african american professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message . 
if a big musical number like 'praise the lord , he's the god of second chances' doesn't put you off , this will be an enjoyable choice for younger kids . 
suffers from a flat script and a low budget . 
aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend . when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music . 
it's just rather leaden and dull . 
as animation increasingly emphasizes the computer and the cool , this is a film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth . 
it is most of the things costner movies are known for ; it's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it . 
an affectionately goofy satire that's unafraid to throw elbows when necessary . . . 
tells ( the story ) with such atmospheric ballast that shrugging off the plot's persnickety problems is simply a matter of ( being ) in a shrugging mood . 
there is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down . and that should tell you everything you need to know about all the queen's men . 
mr . tsai is a very original artist in his medium , and what time is it there ? should be seen at the very least for its spasms of absurdist humor . 
a comedy that swings and jostles to the rhythms of life . 
whether writer-director anne fontaine's film is a ghost story , an account of a nervous breakdown , a trip down memory lane , all three or none of the above , it is as seductive as it is haunting . 
the overall fabric is hypnotic , and mr . mattei fosters moments of spontaneous intimacy . 
despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype . 
a thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions . 
most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes . 
the ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch . 
colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you , burkinabe filmmaker dani kouyate's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory . 
it's a lovely , eerie film that casts an odd , rapt spell . 
a biopic about crane's life in the classic tradition but evolves into what has become of us all in the era of video . 
' . . . the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well . . . but quite frankly , scoob and shag don't eat enough during the film . '
a sobering and powerful documentary about the most severe kind of personal loss : rejection by one's mother . 
as allen's execution date closes in , the documentary gives an especially poignant portrait of her friendship with the never flagging legal investigator david presson . 
at times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated ( depending upon where you live ) , ignorant fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two . 
teen movies have really hit the skids . 
although made on a shoestring and unevenly acted , conjures a lynch-like vision of the rotting underbelly of middle america . 
hits one out of the park for the 'they don't make 'em like that anymore' department . 
from blushing to gushing---imamura squirts the screen in �warm water under a red bridge'
it has become apparent that the franchise's best years are long past . 
here's a self-congratulatory 3d imax rah-rah . 
ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about " chicago " in 2002 . zellweger's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
illiterate , often inert sci-fi action thriller . 
poignant if familiar story of a young person suspended between two cultures . 
there's not much to fatale , outside of its stylish surprises . . . but that's ok . 
richly entertaining and suggestive of any number of metaphorical readings . 
there is little question that this is a serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how , in the flip-flop of courtship , we often reel in when we should be playing out . 
an eloquent , reflective and beautifully acted meditation on both the profoundly devastating events of one year ago and the slow , painful healing process that has followed in their wake . 
a depressing confirmation of everything those of us who don't object to the description " unelected " have suspected all along : george w . bush is an incurious , uncharismatic , overgrown frat boy with a mean streak a mile wide . 
an amusing and unexpectedly insightful examination of sexual jealousy , resentment and the fine line between passion and pretence . 
the movie's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had . 
while the filmmaking may be a bit disjointed , the subject matter is so fascinating that you won't care . 
a faster paced family flick . upper teens may get cynical . smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy . 
yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it's also a failure of storytelling . 
this version's no classic like its predecessor , but its pleasures are still plentiful . 
not since ghostbusters has a film used manhattan's architecture in such a gloriously goofy way . 
a shame that stealing harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable . 
montias . . . pumps a lot of energy into his nicely nuanced narrative and surrounds himself with a cast of quirky -- but not stereotyped -- street characters .

something akin to a japanese alice through the looking glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously . 
enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts . . . what is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with cage's best acting .

like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness . 
it's a demented kitsch mess ( although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative ) , but it's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year .

theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues . 
a recipe for cinematic disaster . . . part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it's all bad .

a crass and insulting homage to great films like some like it hot and the john wayne classics . 
un thriller manqu� qui tombe sur les nerfs presque d�s la premi�re image . 
the second coming of harry potter is a film far superior to its predecessor . a movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the godzilla sized soda . 
while the glass slipper doesn't quite fit , pumpkin is definitely a unique modern fairytale . 
the film's snags and stumblings are more than compensated for by its wryly subversive tone .

majidi gets uniformly engaging performances from his largely amateur cast . 
audacious-impossible yet compelling . . . 
its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider's performance is so fine , it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess . 
opens as promising as any war/adventure film you'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled " glory : a soldier's story . "

the word that comes to mind , while watching eric rohmer's tribute to a courageous scottish lady , is painterly . 
while it regards 1967 as the key turning point of the 20th century , and returns again and again to images of dissidents in the streets , it's alarmingly current . 
without ever becoming didactic , director carlos carrera expertly weaves this novelistic story of entangled interrelationships and complex morality . 
claude chabrol has here a thriller without thrills , but that's okay . 
there's back-stabbing , inter-racial desire and , most importantly , singing and dancing . 
the film's best trick is the way that it treats conspiracy as a kind of political blair witch , a monstrous murk that haunts us precisely because it can never be seen .

wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it isn't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited . 
everything is off . 
a romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe . 
with the prospect of films like kangaroo jack about to burst across america's winter movie screens it's a pleasure to have a film like the hours as an alternative . 
too clever by about nine-tenths . 
they crush each other under cars , throw each other out windows , electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness . and we don't avert our eyes for a moment . 
ofrece una buena oportunidad de cultura ( aunque sea condensada ) que bien vale la pena aprovechar . 
i can only imagine one thing worse than kevin spacey trying on an irish accent , and that's sultry linda fiorentino doing the same thing . 
[javier bardem is] one of the few reasons to watch the film , which director gerardo vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama . 
nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing . 
too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century . 
while the film is competent , it's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires . 
a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff . 
it's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue . 
it might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a three's company-style laugh track . 
there's nothing exactly wrong here , but there's not nearly enough that's right . 
a rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade . 
the plot is nothing but boilerplate clich�s from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times
it's crap on a leash--far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante's similarly styled gremlins . 
i'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - arnold is not , nor will he be , back . 
the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie . 
sc2 is an autopilot hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit , yet it's geared toward an audience full of masters of both . 
does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of richard nixon . 
the camera soars above the globe in dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the large-screen format , before swooping down on a string of exotic locales , scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm . 
there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title . 
it wouldn't matter so much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny . 
for veggietales fans , this is more appetizing than a side dish of asparagus . if you're not a fan , it might be like trying to eat brussels sprouts . 
lan yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama , but it doesn't even try for the greatness that happy together shoots for ( and misses ) . 
with each of her three protagonists , miller eloquently captures the moment when a woman's life , out of a deep-seated , emotional need , is about to turn onto a different path . 
like the series , the movie is funny , smart , visually inventive , and most of all , alive . 
a 'girls gone wild' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation isn't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers aren't removed and inquisitive enough for that . 
lillard and cardellini earn their scooby snacks , but not anyone else . 
[reno] delivers a monologue that manages to incorporate both the horror and the absurdity of the situation in a well-balanced fashion . 
munch's screenplay is tenderly observant of his characters . he watches them as they float within the seas of their personalities . his scenes are short and often unexpected . 
the fun of the movie is the chance it affords to watch jackson , who also served as executive producer , take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act abroad . 
mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting men in black mayhem to one part family values . 
a dazzling dream of a documentary . 
davis has energy , but she doesn't bother to make her heroine's book sound convincing , the gender-war ideas original , or the comic scenes fly . 
this is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks . 
a highly personal look at the effects of living a dysfunctionally privileged lifestyle , and by the end , we only wish we could have spent more time in its world . 
the film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries . 
jam-packed with literally bruising jokes . every five minutes or so , someone gets clocked . 
what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about . 
children , christian or otherwise , deserve to hear the full story of jonah's despair -- in all its agonizing , catch-22 glory -- even if they spend years trying to comprehend it . 
parker holds true to wilde's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness . 
a relative letdown . 
show me the mugging . 
offers absolutely nothing i hadn't already seen . 
bluto blutarsky , we miss you . 
directors harry gantz and joe gantz have chosen a fascinating subject matter , but the couples exposing themselves aren't all that interesting . 
add yet another hat to a talented head , clooney's a good director . 
laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters . 
[it's] a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy . 
the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome . 
this humbling little film , fueled by the light comedic work of zhao benshan and the delicate ways of dong jie , is just the sort for those moviegoers who complain that 'they don't make movies like they used to anymore . '
draggin' about dragons
too daft by half . . . but supremely good natured . 
to me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy . 
like those to rome , all roads in the banger sisters inevitably lead to a joke about hawn's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them . 
the problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum . a rumor of angels doesn't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness . 
it's a smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn . nothing overly original , mind you , but solidly entertaining . 
neither the funniest film that eddie murphy nor robert de niro has ever made , showtime is nevertheless efficiently amusing for a good while . before it collapses into exactly the kind of buddy cop comedy it set out to lampoon , anyway . 
[sports] admirable energy , full-bodied characterizations and narrative urgency . 
the result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone . 
the best drug addition movies are usually depressing but rewarding . quitting , however , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance . 
this is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing . 
somehow we're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become g . i . jane . 
not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired . 
without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie . now it's a bad , embarrassing movie . 
a must see for all sides of the political spectrum
the tale of tok ( andy lau ) , a sleek sociopath on the trail of o ( takashi sorimachi ) , the most legendary of asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold . 
the effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it's hardly watchable . 
both damning and damned compelling . 
a high-minded snoozer . 
has a shambling charm . . . a cheerfully inconsequential diversion . 
once one experiences mr . haneke's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience , one is left with a sour taste in one's mouth , and little else . 
i can't recommend it . but it's surprisingly harmless . 
bogdanovich taps deep into the hearst mystique , entertainingly reenacting a historic scandal . 
a delightful stimulus for the optic nerves , so much that it's forgivable that the plot feels like every other tale of a totalitarian tomorrow . 
will warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it . 
it's all a rather shapeless good time . . . 
dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation . 
instead of letting the laughs come as they may , lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick . 
watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good . 
featherweight romantic comedy has a few nice twists in a standard plot and the charisma of hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject . 
 . . . a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the linux cause . 
nijinsky says , 'i know how to suffer' and if you see this film you'll know too . 
impossible as it may sound , this film's heart is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition . 
yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-brits genre that was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit . 
van wilder doesn't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like tomcats , freddy got fingered , and slackers . 
taken individually or collectively , the stories never add up to as much as they promise . 
it's a rollicking adventure for you and all your mateys , regardless of their ages . 
can't get enough of libidinous young city dwellers ? try this obscenely bad dark comedy , so crass that it makes edward burns' sidewalks of new york look like oscar wilde . 
kids will love its fantasy and adventure , and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor . 
a certain sexiness underlines even the dullest tangents . 
the film is strictly routine . 
the bourne identity shouldn't be half as entertaining as it is , but director doug liman and his colleagues have managed to pack it with enough action to satisfy the boom-bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood . 
this is a stunning film , a one-of-a-kind tour de force . 
too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot . 
it's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that's been given the drive of a narrative and that's been acted out -- the believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work . 
could this be the first major studio production shot on video tape instead of film ? 
wins my vote for 'the 2002 enemy of cinema' award . 
the film does give a pretty good overall picture of the situation in laramie following the murder of matthew shepard . 
sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance . 
there is so much plodding sensitivity . 
calculated swill . 
there's enough science to make it count as educational , and enough beauty to make it unforgettable . 
another trumpet blast that there may be a new mexican cinema a-bornin' . 
could as easily have been called 'under siege 3 : in alcatraz' . . . a cinematic corpse that never springs to life . 
from a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving french drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times . 
this time mr . burns is trying something in the martin scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again . 
a family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise . 
a well-rounded tribute to a man whose achievements -- and complexities -- reached far beyond the end zone . 
the film boasts dry humor and jarring shocks , plus moments of breathtaking mystery . 
you won't look at religious fanatics -- or backyard sheds -- the same way again . 
never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction . 
drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the- past numbness . 
 . . . the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank . 
if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh . 
with amazing finesse , the film shadows heidi's trip back to vietnam and the city where her mother , mai thi kim , still lives . 
the documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation . 
as saccharine as it is disposable . 
what full frontal lacks in thematic coherence it largely makes up for as loosey-goosey , experimental entertainment . still , i'm not quite sure what the point is�
it is a likable story , told with competence . 
a reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided . 
an engrossing portrait of uncompromising artists trying to create something original against the backdrop of a corporate music industry that only seems to care about the bottom line . 
a splendid entertainment , young in spirit but accomplished in all aspects with the fullness of spirit and sense of ease that comes only with experience . 
the direction , by george hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism . 
eckstraordinarily lame and severely boring . 
as played by ryan gosling , danny is a frighteningly fascinating contradiction . 
an unbelievably fun film just a leading man away from perfection . 
strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression . 
rich in atmosphere of the post-war art world , it manages to instruct without reeking of research library dust . 
what is captured during the conceptual process doesn't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , the selection , became in its final form . 
will only satisfy those who can't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly . 
a touching drama about old age and grief with a tour de force performance by michel piccoli . 
sodden and glum , even in those moments where it's supposed to feel funny and light . 
ararat feels like a book report
even better than the first one ! 
in the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , the emperor's club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach . 
satin rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey , but it's encouraging to see a three-dimensional , average , middle-aged woman's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity . 
a fanciful drama about napoleon's last years and his surprising discovery of love and humility . 
even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency . 
it never fails to engage us . 
a chronicle not only of one man's quest to be president , but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten , cynical journalists into what was essentially , by campaign's end , an extended publicity department . 
an overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce . 
tedious norwegian offering which somehow snagged an oscar nomination . 
it ain't art , by a long shot , but unlike last year's lame musketeer , this dumas adaptation entertains . 
the film is one of the year's best . 
it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment . 
 . . . the one thing this wild film has that other imax films don't : chimps , lots of chimps , all blown up to the size of a house . that's fun for kids of any age . 
it won't harm anyone , but neither can i think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it . after all , it'll probably be in video stores by christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies . 
comes across as a fairly weak retooling . 
the hot topics of the plot are relegated to the background -- a welcome step forward from the sally jesse raphael atmosphere of films like philadelphia and american beauty . 
ramsay succeeds primarily with her typical blend of unsettling atmospherics , delivering a series of abrasive , stylized sequences that burn themselves upon the viewer's memory . 
cacoyannis' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts . 
pretend it's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away . it's fun , but it's a real howler . 
a puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks . 
the film hinges on its performances , and both leads are up to the task . 
the pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs . 
like a fish that's lived too long , austin powers in goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places . 
the film favors the scientific over the spectacular ( visually speaking ) . 
bittersweet comedy/drama full of life , hand gestures , and some really adorable italian guys . 
this movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment . 
the chateau cleverly probes the cross-cultural differences between gauls and yanks . 
that the e-graveyard holds as many good ideas as bad is the cold comfort that chin's film serves up with style and empathy . 
undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters . 
nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams . 
it's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from " promising " to " interesting " to " familiar " before landing squarely on " stupid " . 
puportedly " based on true events , " a convolution of language that suggests it's impossible to claim that it is " based on a true story " with a straight face . 
clint eastwood's blood work is a lot like a well-made pb& j sandwich : familiar , fairly uneventful and boasting no real surprises � but still quite tasty and inviting all the same . 
believes so fervently in humanity that it feels almost anachronistic , and it is too cute by half . but arriving at a particularly dark moment in history , it offers flickering reminders of the ties that bind us . 
mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity . 
[seagal's] strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year's razzie . 
when the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you're in trouble . 
welles groupie/scholar peter bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant william randolph hearst . 
it's one of the saddest films i have ever seen that still manages to be uplifting but not overly sentimental . 
damon brings the proper conviction to his role as [jason bourne] . 
gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing . 
a film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations . 
phoned-in business as usual . 
trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive . 
the warm presence of zhao benshan makes the preposterous lying hero into something more than he reasonably should be . 
jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can , but all the bouncing back and forth can't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting . 
all right , so it's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking , but it is a funny ( sometimes hilarious ) comedy with a deft sense of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast . 
gets better after foster leaves that little room . 
the tug of war that ensues is as much a snapshot of modern china in microcosm as it is a crash course in movie mythology . 
every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least--annoying , isn't it ? 
i don't think this movie loves women at all . 
for the future , one hopes mr . plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter . 
flavorful and romantic , you could call this how martha got her groove back -- assuming , that is , she ever had one to begin with . 
both exuberantly romantic and serenely melancholy , what time is it there ? may prove to be [tsai's] masterpiece . 
has a lot of the virtues of eastwood at his best . 
instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart's war , like the st . louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started . 
director david jacobson gives dahmer a consideration that the murderer never game his victims . 
decasia is what has happened already to so many silent movies , newsreels and the like . the unexpected thing is that its dying , in this shower of black-and-white psychedelia , is quite beautiful . 
the rare movie that's as crisp and to the point as the novel on which it's based . 
this is a story that zings all the way through with originality , humour and pathos . 
a charming and funny story of clashing cultures and a clashing mother/daughter relationship . 
the sweetest thing , a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies , may be a mess in a lot of ways . but it does have one saving grace . a lot of its gags and observations reflect a woman's point-of-view . 
it's a brilliant , honest performance by nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic kathy bates turns up . bravado kathy ! 
the series' message about making the right choice in the face of tempting alternatives remains prominent , as do the girls' amusing personalities . 
resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project . 
a ragbag of cliches . 
a mimetic approximation of better films like contempt and 8 1/2 . 
although fairly involving as far as it goes , the film doesn't end up having much that is fresh to say about growing up catholic or , really , anything . 
symbolically , warm water under a red bridge is a celebration of feminine energy , a tribute to the power of women to heal . 
a bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 ( k ) statement . 
the pool drowned me in boredom . 
an entertaining , colorful , action-filled crime story with an intimate heart . 
seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it's a sad , sick sight . 
those who aren't put off by the film's austerity will find it more than capable of rewarding them . 
its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing . 
bad company . bad movie . just plain bad . 
adaptation is intricately constructed and in a strange way nails all of orlean's themes without being a true adaptation of her book . 
bad company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script . 
despite the surface attractions -- conrad l . hall's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there's something impressive and yet lacking about everything . 
an overstuffed compendium of teen-catholic-movie dogma . 
a chilling tale of one of the great crimes of 20th century france : the murder of two rich women by their servants in 1933 . 
a miniscule little bleep on the film radar , but one that many more people should check out
if hill isn't quite his generation's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ) , it's because there's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it's all bluster and clich� . 
its gross-out gags and colorful set pieces . . . are of course stultifyingly contrived and too stylized by half . still , it gets the job done -- a sleepy afternoon rental . 
even bigger and more ambitious than the first installment , spy kids 2 looks as if it were made by a highly gifted 12-year-old instead of a grown man . 
confessions is without a doubt a memorable directorial debut from king hunk . 
pratfalls aside , barbershop gets its greatest play from the timeless spectacle of people really talking to each other . 
a thoroughly enjoyable , heartfelt coming-of-age comedy . 
the movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge . a touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back . 
[fiji diver rusi vulakoro and the married couple howard and michelle hall] show us the world they love and make us love it , too . 
maid in manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road . . . but as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans' lofty expectations , the movie passes inspection . 
like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable . 
not at all clear what it's trying to say and even if it were � i doubt it would be all that interesting . 
what jackson has accomplished here is amazing on a technical level . 
i can't remember the last time i saw a movie where i wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail . 
the movie's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director michel gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness . 
perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced , false and fabricated . 
there's not enough to sustain the comedy . 
[russell] makes good b movies ( the mask , the blob ) , and the scorpion king more than ably meets those standards .

tiresomely derivative and hammily acted . 
like being trapped at a perpetual frat party . . . how can something so gross be so boring ?

a film of delicate interpersonal dances . caine makes us watch as his character awakens to the notion that to be human is eventually to have to choose . it's a sight to behold .

sayles has an eye for the ways people of different ethnicities talk to and about others outside the group . 
while the stoically delivered hokum of hart's war is never fun , it's still a worthy addition to the growing canon of post-saving private ryan tributes to the greatest generation .

it's difficult to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing--i'm prepared to call it a draw . 
as weber and weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve , the cockettes weren't as much about gender , sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel , connect and create . 
imamura has said that warm water under a red bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women . it may also be the best sex comedy about environmental pollution ever made .

mariah carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls . 
the script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters . 
the far future may be awesome to consider , but from period detail to matters of the heart , this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past . 
maybe thomas wolfe was right : you can't go home again .

a mature , deeply felt fantasy of a director's travel through 300 years of russian history . 
spectacularly beautiful , not to mention mysterious , sensual , emotionally intense , and replete with virtuoso throat-singing . 
with not a lot of help from the screenplay ( proficient , but singularly cursory ) , [testud] acts with the feral intensity of the young bette davis . 
its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack , might have made a point or two regarding life . 
a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft . 
mr . wollter and ms . seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear . 
an admitted egomaniac , evans is no hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he'd gone the way of don simpson . 
just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story . or a profit . or some damn thing . 
 . . . think of it as american pie on valium .

the climactic events are so well realized that you may forget all about the original conflict , just like the movie does
a fine production with splendid singing by angela gheorghiu , ruggero raimondi , and roberto alagna . 
bubba ho-tep is a wonderful film with a bravura lead performance by bruce campbell that doesn't deserve to leave the building until everyone is aware of it .

gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid . . . a curiously constricted epic . 
holds limited appeal to those who like explosions , sadism and seeing people beat each other to a pulp . 
the film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it's insanely violent and very graphic . 
i can imagine this movie as a b&w british comedy , circa 1960 , with peter sellers , kenneth williams , et al . , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless . 
those prone to indignation need not apply ; those susceptible to blue hilarity , step right up . 
twenty years later , reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery , but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast-forward technology that he so stringently takes to task .

where janice beard falters in its recycled aspects , implausibility , and sags in pace , it rises in its courageousness , and comedic employment . 
mildly amusing .

despite slick production values and director roger michell's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours . 
it gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff . 
a fascinating examination of the joyous , turbulent self-discovery made by a proper , middle-aged woman . 
scooby-doo doesn't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick . 
strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , the four feathers comes up short . 
the film's highlight is definitely its screenplay , both for the rhapsodic dialogue that jumps off the page , and for the memorable character creations . 
this one is a few bits funnier than malle's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks . 
kiarostami has crafted a deceptively casual ode to children and managed to convey a tiny sense of hope . 
there are enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smile-button faces on that segment of the populace that made a walk to remember a niche hit . 
a quiet , disquieting triumph . 
nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here . 
according to wendigo , 'nature' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves . 
kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party .

equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid . 
the movie understands like few others how the depth and breadth of emotional intimacy give the physical act all of its meaning and most of its pleasure . 
not even the hanson brothers can save it
the pianist lacks the quick emotional connections of steven spielberg's schindler's list . but mr . polanski creates images even more haunting than those in mr . spielberg's 1993 classic . 
the kind of sweet-and-sour insider movie that film buffs will eat up like so much gelati . 
aan opportunity wasted . 
another entertaining romp from robert rodriguez .

the holiday message of the 37-minute santa vs . the snowman leaves a lot to be desired . 
movie fans , get ready to take off . . . the other direction . 
high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue . 
at the end of the movie , my 6-year-old nephew said , " i guess i come from a broken family , and my uncles are all aliens , too . " congrats disney on a job well done , i enjoyed it just as much ! 
its metaphors are opaque enough to avoid didacticism , and the film succeeds as an emotionally accessible , almost mystical work . 
in auteil's less dramatic but equally incisive performance , he's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer . 
involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters . 
as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma . 
entertaining enough , but nothing new
the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences . 
one of those based-on-truth stories that persuades you , with every scene , that it could never really have happened this way . 
home alone goes hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even steven spielberg would know how to do . besides , real movie producers aren't this nice . 
vampire epic succeeds as spooky action-packed trash of the highest order .

the first half bursts with a goofy energy previous disney films only used for a few minutes here and there . 
sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff . 
it's a wonderful , sobering , heart-felt drama . 
less than fresh . 
one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time . 
too bad maggio couldn't come up with a better script . 
williams plays sy , another of his open-faced , smiling madmen , like the killer in insomnia . he does this so well you don't have the slightest difficulty accepting him in the role . 
oscar caliber cast doesn't live up to material
leave it to rohmer , now 82 , to find a way to bend current technique to the service of a vision of the past that is faithful to both architectural glories and commanding open spaces of the city as it was more than two centuries ago .

it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong .

pretend like your sat scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws . 
a bowel-curdling , heart-stopping recipe for terror . 
one of the year's best films , featuring an oscar-worthy performance by julianne moore . 
deserving of its critical backlash and more .

love may have been in the air onscreen , but i certainly wasn't feeling any of it . 
calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls . 
between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap .

there has been much puzzlement among critics about what the election symbolizes . i believe the message is in the messenger : the agent is a woman .

this is human comedy at its most amusing , interesting and confirming . 
it's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star jake gyllenhaal but also from accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon , dustin hoffman and holly hunter , yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb . 
bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
s1m0ne's satire is not subtle , but it is effective . it's a quirky , off-beat project . . . . 
beautifully filmed and well acted . . . but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics . 
a puzzling experience . 
surprisingly powerful and universal . 
twohy's a good yarn-spinner , and ultimately the story compels . 
you come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that's at the center of the story . 
snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like 'masterpiece' and 'triumph' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers' time with a gobbler like this .

an unsettling , memorable cinematic experience that does its predecessors proud . 
barney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful . 
one scarcely needs the subtitles to enjoy this colorful action farce . 
this rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens . . . or if it were subtler . . . or if it had a sense of humor . 
a movie like the guys is why film criticism can be considered work .

not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers .

it's clear why deuces wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on mgm's shelf . 
schmaltzy and unfunny , adam sandler's cartoon about hanukkah is numbingly bad , little nicky bad , 10 worst list bad . 
the overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts . 
remarkable for its excellent storytelling , its economical , compressed characterisations and for its profound humanity , it's an adventure story and history lesson all in one . 
the thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes ( of which they'll get plenty ) fills me with revulsion . 
witless but watchable . 
contains all the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing . 
i highly recommend irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him .

this thing is just garbage . 
scott delivers a terrific performance in this fascinating portrait of a modern lothario . 
on its own , it's not very interesting . as a remake , it's a pale imitation . 
an empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance . 
with the exception of mccoist , the players don't have a clue on the park . the acting isn't much better . 
just as the lousy tarantino imitations have subsided , here comes the first lousy guy ritchie imitation .

the script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that doesn't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people .

insomnia is one of the year's best films and pacino gives one of his most daring , and complicated , performances . 
a sports movie with action that's exciting on the field and a story you care about off it . 
it's neither as romantic nor as thrilling as it should be . but it offers plenty to ponder and chew on as its unusual relationship slowly unfolds . 
it is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental , and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients .

rodriguez has the chops of a smart-aleck film school brat and the imagination of a big kid . . . 
simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair susan sarandon and goldie hawn . 
a violent initiation rite for the audience , as much as it is for angelique , the [opening] dance guarantees karmen's enthronement among the cinema's memorable women . 
the charms of the lead performances allow us to forget most of the film's problems . 
j . lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : she's a pretty woman , but she's no working girl . 
audrey tatou has a knack for picking roles that magnify her outrageous charm , and in this literate french comedy , she's as morning-glory exuberant as she was in am�lie .

a remarkable 179-minute meditation on the nature of revolution . 
it's quite diverting nonsense . 
[fessenden] is much more into ambiguity and creating mood than he is for on screen thrills
everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable . 
thoughtful , even stinging at times , and lots of fun . 
as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved . 
it's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before . 
 . . . while dark water isn't a complete wash ( no pun intended ) , watched side-by-side with ringu , it ultimately comes off as a pale successor . 
a great cast and a wonderful but sometimes confusing flashback movie about growing up in a dysfunctional family . 
goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing . . . but she and writing partner laurence coriat don't manage an equally assured narrative coinage . 
the film's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments . 
lends itself to the narcotizing bland ( sinister , though not nearly so sinister as the biennial disney girl movie ) machinations of the biennial disney boy movie . 
the best movie in many a moon about the passions that sometimes fuel our best achievements and other times leave us stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites . 
there has always been something likable about the marquis de sade . 
the movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy . 
how do you spell clich� ? 
nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release . 
 . . . certainly an entertaining ride , despite many talky , slow scenes . but something seems to be missing . a sense of real magic , perhaps . 
this tenth feature is a big deal , indeed -- at least the third-best , and maybe even a notch above the previous runner-up , nicholas meyer's star trek vi : the undiscovered country . 
standing in the shadows of motown is the best kind of documentary , one that makes a depleted yesterday feel very much like a brand-new tomorrow . 
works on the whodunit level as its larger themes get lost in the murk of its own making
the powerpuff girls arrive on the big screen with their super-powers , their super-simple animation and their super-dooper-adorability intact . 
what's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class . 
mcconaughey's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script . 
interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots . 
reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and ryoko hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that . 
 a thought-provoking look at how western foreign policy - however well intentioned - can wreak havoc in other cultures . 
a savvy exploration of paranoia and insecurity in america's culture of fear . 
delivers the same old same old , tarted up with latin flava and turned out by hollywood playas . 
displays the potential for a better movie than what bailly manages to deliver
a quiet treasure -- a film to be savored . 
a dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise . 
you see robin williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm . you see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz . 
george , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please . 
what could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess . 
hands down the year's most thought-provoking film . but it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship . 
a predictable , manipulative stinker . the story passes time until it's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge . 
cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy . 
has all the depth of a wading pool .

national lampoon's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion
rifkin's references are . . . impeccable throughout .

 . . . if you're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie , you might want to catch freaks as a matinee . 
nine queens is not only than a frighteningly capable debut and genre piece , but also a snapshot of a dangerous political situation on the verge of coming to a head . 
it is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story . 
by and large this is mr . kilmer's movie , and it's his strongest performance since the doors . 
dramatically lackluster . 
a gorgeously strange movie , heaven is deeply concerned with morality , but it refuses to spell things out for viewers . 
the history is fascinating ; the action is dazzling . they just don't work in concert . 
offers a persuasive look at a defeated but defiant nation in flux . 
a wonderfully warm human drama that remains vividly in memory long after viewing
there's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant . 
even when crush departs from the 4w formula . . . it feels like a glossy rehash . 
an utterly compelling 'who wrote it' in which the reputation of the most famous author who ever lived comes into question . 
feeling like a dope has rarely been more fun than it is in nine queens . 
spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but it lacks a strong narrative . 
takes you by the face , strokes your cheeks and coos beseechingly at you : slow down , shake off your tensions and take this picture at its own breezy , distracted rhythms . 
a really good premise is frittered away in middle-of-the-road blandness . 
a film that will probably please people already fascinated by behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration . 
fessenden's narrative is just as much about the ownership and redefinition of myth as it is about a domestic unit finding their way to joy . 
 . . . too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying . 
a cockamamie tone poem pitched precipitously between swoony lyricism and violent catastrophe . . . the most aggressively nerve-wracking and screamingly neurotic romantic comedy in cinema history . 
a fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special . 
schepisi , aided by a cast that seems to include every top-notch british actor who did not appear in gosford park ( as well as one , ms . mirren , who did ) , has succeeded beyond all expectation . 
the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama . 
a timely look back at civil disobedience , anti-war movements and the power of strong voices . 
enjoyably fast-moving , hard-hitting documentary . 
a completely spooky piece of business that gets under your skin and , some plot blips aside , stays there for the duration . 
what's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy . 
flamboyant in some movies and artfully restrained in others , 65-year-old jack nicholson could be looking at his 12th oscar nomination by proving that he's now , more than ever , choosing his roles with the precision of the insurance actuary . 
normally , rohmer's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable . 
a bilingual charmer , just like the woman who inspired it
not everyone will welcome or accept the trials of henry kissinger as faithful portraiture , but few can argue that the debate it joins is a necessary and timely one . 
the basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy . 
it takes you somewhere you're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface ( and exotic dancing ) it's surprisingly old-fashioned . 
[davis] has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race . 
a seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer-director kurt wimmer at the screenplay level . 
the predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances . 
with a cast that includes some of the top actors working in independent film , lovely & amazing involves us because it is so incisive , so bleakly amusing about how we go about our lives . 
hip-hop has a history , and it's a metaphor for this love story . 
in comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class london life ; despite the title . . . amounts to surprisingly little . 
for dance completists only . 
scotland looks wonderful , the fans are often funny fanatics , the showdown sure beats a bad day of golf . 
the editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden . 
overall , it's a pretty mediocre family film . 
 ( wendigo is ) why we go to the cinema : to be fed through the eye , the heart , the mind . 
woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the " saving private ryan " battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ? 
vibrantly colored and beautifully designed , metropolis is a feast for the eyes . 
the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize , of course , two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie . 
with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral . 
sandra bullock's best dramatic performance to date ( is ) almost enough to lift ( this ) thrill-kill cat-and-mouser . . . above its paint-by-numbers plot . 
the film oozes craft . 
this film , starring anthony hopkins and chris rock , is your typical 'fish out of water' story . you've seen them a million times . just one problem : fish out of water usually die . this one does . 
a finely tuned mood piece , a model of menacing atmosphere . 
yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a can't-miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong . 
 " men in black ii , " has all the earmarks of a sequel . the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ? 
from the dull , surreal ache of mortal awareness emerges a radiant character portrait . 
however stale the material , lawrence's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny . 
a remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic . 
if you are into splatter movies , then you will probably have a reasonably good time with the salton sea . 
a turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull . 
now i can see why people thought i was too hard on " the mothman prophecies " . 
the plan to make enough into �an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller' has flopped as surely as a souffl� gone wrong . 
the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny . 
the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood . 
a good film with a solid pedigree both in front of and , more specifically , behind the camera . 
what's next : " my mother the car ? " 
it's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u . s . art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it's in french ( well , mostly ) with english subtitles and is magically 'significant' because of that . 
broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient . 
doesn't amount to much of anything . 
despite besson's high-profile name being wasabi's big selling point , there is no doubt that krawczyk deserves a huge amount of the credit for the film's thoroughly winning tone . 
[creates] the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama . 
it's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out 'amateur' in almost every frame . 
the problem with all of this : it's not really funny . 
dark , resonant , inventively detailed and packed with fleet turns of plot and a feast of visual amazement . 
the cold turkey would've been a far better title . 
 . . . a solid , unassuming drama . 
if this is an example of the type of project that robert redford's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films . 
when a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that's a bad sign . a very bad sign . 
brown's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie . 
you'll just have your head in your hands wondering why lee's character didn't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery . 
the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head . 
it's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but notorious c . h . o . still feels like a promising work-in-progress . 
a devastating indictment of unbridled greed and materalism . 
the movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable na�vet� and arbitrary flashbacks . 
got a david lynch jones ? then you'd do well to check this one out because it's straight up twin peaks action . . . 
the performances of the children , untrained in acting , have an honesty and dignity that breaks your heart . 
the high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there's very little hustling on view . 
deep down , i realized the harsh reality of my situation : i would leave the theater with a lower i . q . than when i had entered . 
like most bond outings in recent years , some of the stunts are so outlandish that they border on being cartoonlike . a heavy reliance on cgi technology is beginning to creep into the series . 
the movie's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself doesn't stand a ghost of a chance . 
a baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise . 
beautifully produced . 
witty , contemplative , and sublimely beautiful . 
if only merchant paid more attention the story . 
just watch bettany strut his stuff . you'll know a star when you see one . 
the film's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what i was expecting . 
in imax in short , it's just as wonderful on the big screen . 
the 1960s rebellion was misdirected : you can't fight your culture . 
the bai brothers have taken an small slice of history and opened it up for all of us to understand , and they've told a nice little story in the process . 
made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss . 
it sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations . 
ringu is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills . ignore the reputation , and ignore the film . 
the actors are appealing , but elysian fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental . 
from its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , bartleby squanders as much as it gives out . 
director carl franklin , so crisp and economical in one false move , bogs down in genre cliches here . 
it's hard to imagine anybody ever being " in the mood " to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone , but it's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it's started . 
one regards reign of fire with awe . what a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea .

the movie isn't just hilarious : it's witty and inventive , too , and in hindsight , it isn't even all that dumb . 
a sun-drenched masterpiece , part parlor game , part psychological case study , part droll social satire . 
as broad and cartoonish as the screenplay is , there is an accuracy of observation in the work of the director , frank novak , that keeps the film grounded in an undeniable social realism . 
because the film deliberately lacks irony , it has a genuine dramatic impact ; it plays like a powerful 1957 drama we've somehow never seen before . 
the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it . 
a jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages . 
the drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin couldn't keep my attention . 
a sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity .

gloriously goofy ( and gory ) midnight movie stuff .

at once a testament to the divine calling of education and a demonstration of the painstaking process of imparting knowledge . 
the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory . 
 . . . in the pile of useless actioners from mtv schmucks who don't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes . 
lisa rinzler's cinematography may be lovely , but love liza's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension .

i'm just too bored to care . 
this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982's tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh . 
like the rugrats movies , the wild thornberrys movie doesn't offer much more than the series , but its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures is particularly welcome . 
as violent , profane and exploitative as the most offensive action flick you've ever seen . 
foster breathes life into a roll that could have otherwise been bland and run of the mill . 
chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum .

first-time director jo�o pedro rodrigues' unwillingness to define his hero's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on . 
as a belated nod to some neglected all-stars , standing in the shadows of motown is cultural history of the best kind : informative , revealing and richly entertaining . 
mild , meandering teen flick . 
it says a lot about a filmmaker when he can be wacky without clobbering the audience over the head and still maintain a sense of urgency and suspense . 
it gives devastating testimony to both people's capacity for evil and their heroic capacity for good . 
this mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost . 
sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred chevy chase and goldie hawn . 
you'd have to be a most hard-hearted person not to be moved by this drama . 
plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure hollywood . 
let's hope -- shall we ? -- that the 'true story' by which all the queen's men is allegedly " inspired " was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what's been cobbled together onscreen . 
one long string of cliches . 
this is art paying homage to art . 
colorful , energetic and sweetly whimsical . . . the rare sequel that's better than its predecessor . 
two hours of melodramatic musical married to two hours of underdog sports intrigue , if the picture also shares the weaknesses of both genres , more's the pity . 
the film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one . 
parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone . . . that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core . 
the directive to protect the code at all costs also begins to blur as the importance of the man and the code merge
this big screen caper has a good bark , far from being a bow-wow . 
garc�a bernal and talanc�n are an immensely appealing couple , and even though their story is predictable , you'll want things to work out . 
don't wait to see this terrific film with your kids -- if you don't have kids borrow some . 
the innocence of holiday cheer ain't what it used to be . 
an even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor . 
this is one of polanski's best films . 
overly stylized with lots of flash black-&-white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , ( it's ) at its worst when it's actually inside the ring . 
rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects . 
a meatier deeper beginning and/or ending would have easily tipped this film into the " a " range , as is , it's a very very strong " b+ . " i love the robust middle of this picture . 
not so much a movie as a picture book for the big screen . this isn't my favorite in the series , still i enjoyed it enough to recommend . 
american and european cinema has amassed a vast holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than the grey zone . 
the movie itself is far from disappointing , offering an original take on courtroom movies , a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance by top-billed star bruce willis . 
like its new england characters , most of whom wander about in thick clouds of denial , the movie eventually gets around to its real emotional business , striking deep chords of sadness . 
the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count . 
what really surprises about wisegirls is its low-key quality and genuine tenderness . 
the ensemble cast turns in a collectively stellar performance , and the writing is tight and truthful , full of funny situations and honest observations . 
the scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film's characters . 
this is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the cliff-notes over reading a full-length classic . 
this formulaic chiller will do little to boost stallone's career .

tackles the difficult subject of grief and loss with such life-embracing spirit that the theme doesn't drag an audience down . 
mark wahlberg . . . may look classy in a '60s-homage pokepie hat , but as a character he's dry , dry , dry . 
another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures . 
duvall is strong as always . 
deliriously funny , fast and loose , accessible to the uninitiated , and full of surprises
as a director , mr . ratliff wisely rejects the temptation to make fun of his subjects . 
it has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death . 
i'm sure if you're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself . . . me , i didn't care for it . 
i won't argue with anyone who calls 'slackers' dumb , insulting , or childish . . . but i laughed so much that i didn't mind . 
� uma pena que , mais tarde , o pr�prio filme abandone o tom de par�dia e passe a utilizar os mesmos clich�s que havia satirizado . 
just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be . 
both a detective story and a romance spiced with the intrigue of academic skullduggery and politics . 
a by-the-numbers patient/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground
a taut , intelligent psychological drama . 
this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long . 
trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere . 
the vitality of the actors keeps the intensity of the film high , even as the strafings blend together . 
a welcome relief from baseball movies that try too hard to be mythic , this one is a sweet and modest and ultimately winning story . 
the movie is not as terrible as the synergistic impulse that created it . 
the entire movie has a truncated feeling , but what's available is lovely and lovable . 
we get light showers of emotion a couple of times , but then -- strangely -- these wane to an inconsistent and ultimately unsatisfying drizzle . 
although it's a bit smug and repetitive , this documentary engages your brain in a way few current films do . 
forget about one oscar nomination for julianne moore this year - she should get all five . 
during the tuxedo's 90 minutes of screen time , there isn't one true 'chan moment' . 
 . . . one of the more influential works of the 'korean new wave' . 
arteta paints a picture of lives lived in a state of quiet desperation . 
a tone of rueful compassion . . . reverberates throughout this film , whose meaning and impact is sadly heightened by current world events . 
eight crazy nights is a showcase for sandler's many talents . 
crossroads feels like a teenybopper ed wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama . 
genuinely touching because it's realistic about all kinds of love . 
initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience . 
will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 . 
it reaffirms life as it looks in the face of death . 
reinforces the talents of screenwriter charlie kaufman , creator of adaptation and being john malkovich . 
for most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence . 
there's not enough here to justify the almost two hours . 
buy popcorn . take nothing seriously and enjoy the ride . 
an admirable , sometimes exceptional film
call me a wimp , but i cried , not once , but three times in this animated sweet film . 
strange and beautiful film . 
jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter's glory days on three's company . 
shanghai ghetto , much stranger than any fiction , brings this unknown slice of history affectingly to life . 
majidi is an unconventional storyteller , capable of finding beauty in the most depressing places . 
how i killed my father would be a rarity in hollywood . it's an actor's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones . 
toes the fine line between cheese and earnestness remarkably well ; everything is delivered with such conviction that it's hard not to be carried away . 
eccentric enough to stave off doldrums , caruso's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable . 
a movie that will wear you out and make you misty even when you don't want to be . 
this is a gorgeous film - vivid with color , music and life . delight your senses and crash this wedding ! 
as a revenge thriller , the movie is serviceable , but it doesn't really deliver the delicious guilty pleasure of the better film versions . 
if director michael dowse only superficially understands his characters , he doesn't hold them in contempt . 
only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry . 
i'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year . 
simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy . 
this is sandler running on empty , repeating what he's already done way too often . 
aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production doesn't work for me . 
represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller/horror genre . 
as the two leads , lathan and diggs are charming and have chemistry both as friends and lovers . 
a movie just for friday fans , critics be damned . if you already like this sort of thing , this is that sort of thing all over again . 
you see robert de niro singing - and dancing to - west side story show tunes . choose your reaction : a . ) that sure is funny ! b . ) that sure is pathetic ! 
as chilling and fascinating as philippe mora's modern hitler-study , snide and prejudice . 
the movie plays up the cartoon's more obvious strength of snazziness while neglecting its less conspicuous writing strength . 
an odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy . 
one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart . 
this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action . 
quite funny for the type of movie it is . . . 
brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , deuces wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism . 
handled correctly , wilde's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice . here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked souffl� . 
 . . . an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar . 
 . . . the efforts of its star , kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught . 
johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to . 
manages to transcend the sex , drugs and show-tunes plot into something far richer . 
final verdict : you've seen it all before . 
poetic , heartbreaking . 
has a certain ghoulish fascination , and generates a fair amount of b-movie excitement . 
an immensely entertaining look at some of the unsung heroes of 20th century pop music .
