queszucenove tadl at cochusetts medical center . he presents with increasing chest pain and shortness of breath . he has a long history of coronary artery disease and has a two prior coronary bypass surgeries . his first coronary bypass surgery was on 5/7/1985 by dr. riez . he had lima to the lad and vein graft to the diagonal and then a snake fashion two circumflexes and to the acute marginal branch of the right coronary artery . he presented with angina and had an occluded lad and severe circumflex and right coronary disease . he had normal left ventricular function . he did well , but had recurrent angina by 1999 and cardiac catheterization in march of 2000 showed normal left ventricular function with a native nondominant right coronary artery having a 95% stenosis and the vein graft to this vessel was occluded . the left main was normal . the lad was also occluded . the circumflex was patent , although there was disease of the obtuse marginal branches . the lima to the lad was patent , but there was downstream 70% lesions at the apical portion of the lad . the snake graft was open to the diagonal and to the first obtuse marginal branch , but was occluded to the second portion of this vessel . for this reason , he had a second bypass operation on 5/5/2000 by dr. riez . he had a vein graft to the acute marginal of the right coronary artery in snake fashion to the terminal portion of the right coronary artery . he had a vein graft to the diagonal and obtuse marginal one and a vein graft on the lad bypassing the mid lesion . the lima was left from the first surgery . he did have transient atrial fibrillation after surgery . he had chest pain and an abnormal stress test in 2001 and cardiac catheterization at that time on 8/28/2001 showed that all the grafts were patent , but the runoff to the first diagonal for the vein graft was compromised and he had a 2.5 x 15 mm s660 stent placed at the ostium of the diagonal branch . he did have recurrent episodes of pain and his last stress test on 1/17/2005 showed that he could exercise for 9 minutes and then reached a peak heart rate of 99 on medication and a blood pressure of 150/100 , but he had shortness of breath and a posterolateral defect with some filling . he therefore was referred for cardiac catheterization . past medical history : his past medical history includes hypertension , elevated cholesterol , and a herniated disc . he also has had cataract repairs . family history : he has a strong family history with a father and an uncle having had coronary disease at a young age . social history : his social history is that he lives in lotyvall 1 , quera , minnesota with his wife second . he has four children . he is present in a capefrecam luhthousy . he does not drink and does not smoke . allergies : he is allergic to contrast dye having had hypotension and is premedicated with steroids . physical examination : on exam , he is 5 feet , 9 inches , and 160 pounds . his blood pressure is 130/75 . his pulse is 50 and regular . his neck veins are not distended . his head and neck exam is normal . his lungs are clear . his cardiac exam shows no murmurs or gallops . his abdomen is benign . his peripheral pulses are intact . his neurologic exam was nonfocal . he is fully oriented . laboratory data on admission : includes an electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with right bundle-branch block . hematocrit 43% , potassium 4.3 , and creatinine of 1.0 . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the cardiac cath laboratory . there , the native right coronary artery was occluded and the vein graft to the rv marginal and the right-sided pda was patent . the lad was occluded and the lima to the proximal lad was patent , but there was also a jump graft that went from the mid to the distal segment of the lad and that was also patent . the vein graft to the diagonal and circumflex was also patent and the ostial diagonal stent was also patent . the culprit territory was the distal left-sided pda coming off the circumflex and this had an 85% stenosis . this was a very small vessel and this was a tortuous segment and a long lesion . it was felt that this single lesion given the open distal right territory was not worth stenting and it was felt that he should be managed medically . left ventriculography showed inferior hypokinesis and anterolateral hypokinesis with preserved left ventricular function . he tolerated the procedure well . he was monitored for the day . he ambulated without difficulty . he was discharged home and will be followed closely by his physicians at sko gerb timp valley health and at middso memorial hospital 's . he will remain on beta blockers , ace inhibitors , statins , aspirin and plavix indefinitely .

stenosis who was admitted for diagnostic cardiac catheterization . over the last four to five months , mr. warm has noted a marked decline in functional capacity with nearly daily pnd and orthopnea . he has not experienced recent syncope but did have a syncopal episode in 1 resulting in implantation of a defibrillator . although in the past , he has been somewhat ambivalent with respect to cardiac surgery , given the decline in his functional capacity , he agreed to undergo repeat cardiac catheterization with a view towards defining his candidacy for cardiac surgery . the patient lives independently with his wife in connecticut and continues to be less and less active unfortunately . he has nearly curtailed his trips to a gymnasium for cardiopulmonary exercising . he does not drink alcohol and does not smoke cigarettes . physical examination on admission : on examination , the patient was an extraordinarily pleasant man who appeared his stated age . his blood pressure was 110/70 . heart was 82 and regular . respiratory rate was 16 . his jugular venous pressure was not elevated and his carotids were 2+ . lungs were notable for adequate air movement with no rales . the first and second heart sounds were physiologically split and the cardiac impulse was rather diffuse and inferiorly displaced . there was an s3 gallop at the apex and a 2/6 murmur of mitral regurgitation at the apex which radiated to the axilla . the abdomen was soft and nontender . there was no organomegaly but modest hepatojugular reflex . the extremities were without edema and were warm and well perfused . the posterior tibialis pulses were intact . laboratory data : sodium 140 , potassium 5.0 , bun 45 , creatinine 1.9 , glucose 90 . albumin 3.6 , hematocrit 41 , white count 8.6 , platelets 388 and pt 12.6 seconds . the chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly and no significant congestion . the ecg was paced . an outpatient echocardiogram revealed a left atrium of 45 mms. , an lv of 60 mms. , ejection fraction of 26% , moderate to severe mitral regurgitation by color and spectral doppler , aortic stenosis with a valve area of .8 cms. squared with a peak gradient of 50 , a mean gradient of 30 , an ejection fraction of 26% with diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis and more severe inferior hypokinesis . there was mild tricuspid insufficiency , an estimated rv peak systolic pressure of 55 and a mild diffuse hypokinesis of the right ventricle . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the hospital following uncomplicated cardiac catheterization that revealed a right atrial pressure of 5 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 23 , pulmonary artery pressure of 56/22 with a mean of 36 , a cardiac output of 6.1 liters per minute with a cardiac index of 3.8 liters per minute per meter squared . the aortic valve gradient was approximately 32 mms of mercury peak with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 cms. squared . coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the dominant right coronary artery in the proximal segment with distal reconstitution via left to right collaterals . left ventriculography revealed a dilated , diffusely and severe hypokinetic left ventricle with the anterior basilar wall best perfused and an ejection fraction of 18% . there was 3+ mitral regurgitation and reflux into the pulmonary veins in the ------ views . in addition , there was a 60% lesion in the left circumflex artery and only minimal irregularities in the left anterior descending itself . the patient tolerated the procedure well apart from a small rise in his creatinine to 2.3 which returned to his baseline value of approximately 1.7 to 1.9 at the time of discharge after holding his diuretics and his vasodilator medications . the patient was seen in consultation by dr. win shufffyfe of the cardiac surgery service and after a long discussion with the patient , dr. shufffyfe and the patient 's family , it was decided to defer cardiac surgery likely indefinitely and probably permanently given the patient 's age , co-morbidities , lack of probable benefit with relief of his mitral regurgitation , modest aortic stenosis and relatively modest coronary artery disease . while in hospital , the patient was seen by lenni breutzoln who felt that the incremental benefit from biventricular pacing was likely to be modest . the patient also underwent a sleep study which revealed evidence for fairly advanced and severe obstructive sleep apnea with multiple hypopneas and apneas , mean duration of which was approximately 30 seconds with one episodes of 68 seconds with a desaturation to 71% . the patient was fitted with a cpap apparatus with titration of 8-12 cms. of water as tolerated as an outpatient . in addition , the patient had oxygen therapy given his prominent desaturation at night . at the time of discharge , the patient 's vasodilator regimen had been winnowed appreciably and he was discharged with a goal weight of 125 lbs . he will be followed both by

creatinine , dr. jescdrig felt that the patient was inadequately stented . as a result she was taken back to the operating room on 6/2/94 and under cystoscopy the old stents were removed and new larger stents were placed . the patient was started on ampicillin and gentamicin for urinary tract infection which ultimately grew out escherichia coli sensitive to the above antibiotics and for right lower lobe pneumonia on x-ray . she was started on nebulizers around-the-clock and chest physical therapy . sputum culture was sent but failed to identify an infective organism . on the above regimen the patient showed marked improvement . her urinary output remained good at 80-100 ccs. per hour . however , her bun and creatinine remained elevated . on 6/5/94 they were 21 and 2.2 respectively . her coumadin anticoagulation was adjusted to give a prothrombin time between 16 and 18 and an i and r of 2.5-3 . on june 5 , 1994 it was decided that mrs. neathe was not stable enough with a line 2 cycle i chemotherapy with ifex , adriamycin and mesna . she was therefore well hydrated and was started on her chemotherapy . in view of her kidney damage it was suggested to change her intravenous antibiotics from ancef and gentamicin to ancef and ciprofloxacin which she tolerated well . on 6/7/94 the patient was found to be mildly confused with persistent nausea and malaise . urinary electrolytes were noted to be within normal limits but her confusion persisted . a neuro-oncology consult was sought which felt this was probably secondary to ifex intoxication and her chemotherapy was stopped . an electroencephalogram was requested and was negative . no computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging study of the head was performed . she continued to have persistent nausea and vomiting with large amount of drainage through the nasogastric tube between 1200 and 1500 ccs. for 24 hours . off her ifex the patient 's sensorium slowly cleared but the nausea and vomiting persisted . for this reason a barium study was performed on 6/12/94 which showed a fixed stricture at the anastomosis of the descending colon with the rectum . the mucosa appeared to be preserved . in addition there was some narrowing in the mid portion of the descending colon . the patient 's white blood count which had been followed carefully began to drop precipitously on 6/11/94 and nadired down to 0.7 on 6/12/94 . the patient was placed on neutropenic precautions , her intravenous antibiotics were continued . her sensorium had cleared . because of persistent nausea and vomiting on june 13 , 1994 a kub and upright was requested which showed large amounts of retained barium confirming a rectosigmoid stricture approximately one centimeter in diameter . the patient 's white blood count persisted in the region of .5 to .6 with an anc of 60 for the next two to three days . in addition her platelets began to drop and reach a level on 6/13/94 . she was maintained on intravenous antibiotics and gcsf therapy was started because of the profound neutropenia . despite the low platelets the patient showed no evidence of active bleeding and was not transfused . a gastrograffin upper gastrointestinal was attempted on 6/14/94 but was unsuccessful due to nausea and vomiting . on conservative therapy the patient 's nausea and vomiting has slowly subsided . a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( peg ) tube was placed on june 18 , 1994 which has helped to decompress the stomach and prevent nausea and vomiting . on 6/17/94 in view of a drop in hematocrit to 25 , the patient was transfused three units of packed red blood cells , white count however had increased to 8.5 and her platelets were on their way up , count was 74,000 . and she was not given platelets in addition . throughout this period the patient 's pain remained well controlled on patient controlled analgesia . after much discussion with the family and social services it was decided to transfer the patient home once stable . on august 21 , 1994 a picc line was placed to facilitate home patient controlled analgesia ( pca ) and on 6/23/94 this was found to be correctly positioned on chest x-ray . on june 23 , 1994 the patient was found to be mobilizing relatively well with few episodes of nausea and vomiting . the peg tube was found to be draining well . she was discharged home in a stable condition into the care of her family . in addition she will be followed by sephsandpot center and dwardsc center who will arrange for home pca ( patient controlled analgesia ) . the patient 's prognosis is guarded . her current code status is do not resuscitate ( dnr ) . medications on discharge : include omeprazole 20 mg. p.o. q.d. , timoptic eye drops .5 percent one drop ou b.i.d. she will receive intravenous fluids d5 1/2 normal saline plus 20 of potassium at 110 ccs / hour at home and is going to be placed on a subcutaneous morphine pump as arranged by sephsandpot center . the patient may have liquids as tolerated but no solid foods . in addition she will be followed by santea gehawhi general hospital for peg tube care and flushing and to assess her pain

{"id": 26, "label": "non-smoker", "text": "principal diagnosis : sternal wound infection . associated diagnoses : infected aortic graft . hypertension . principal procedure : 08/31/98 ascending aortic root replacement with homograft with omentopexy . associated procedures : 09/02/98 sternal debridement . bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flap . right superiorly based rectus abdominis flap . primary closure of wound . history and reason for hospitalization : the patient is a 79 year old gentleman with a history of an ascending aortic graft replacement in 1991 for aortic dissection . at that time the patient 's hospital course was complicated by a sternal wound infection requiring a sternal debridement and subsequent abdominal flap . the patient was then continued by report on dicloxacillin for approximately one year following that reconstructive operation . the patient apparently did well until june 1998 when he noted a bulge in his sternal area . a ruptured aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm at the junction of the graft and arch was diagnosed and this was subsequently repaired . the patient then had recurrent bleeding two weeks later which was once again repaired . however the same problem recurred for a third time and a computer tomogram scan at an outside hospital showed an anterior hematoma . by report the patient was at that time told that there was no more that could be done for him and was then apparently placed on comfort measures and pain control at the outside hospital . however the patient was then subsequently transferred to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital upon request of the family on 8/24/98 for further evaluation and possible intervention . the patient was evaluated by dr. rhalt of dentvailr. medical center . as the patient 's early evaluation the patient underwent an aortogram which showed an ascending aortic graft with bulging flaps and a pseudoaneurysm at the anastomosis of the graft and arch just below the great vessels . there was no evidence for a definite leak but there was evidence for gas bubbles in the anterior posterior distal ends of the grafts consistent with an infectious process . at the same time the patient was seen in consultation by the infectious disease service who upon culturing the patient 's sternal drainage switched the patient from intravenous unasyn to levofloxacin for what appeared to be citrobacter and diphtheroids in the wound cultures . subsequent to starting this antibiotic regimen the patient 's wound drainage appeared to subside . given all the findings on the aortogram and the subsequent chest computer tomogram scan it was discovered that the patient 's only real surgical option for cure was a risky operation that involved removal and replacement of the aortic graft probably with homograft and long term antibiotic coverage as well as a plastic surgical reconstructive procedure . the patient understood the risks and potential benefits of the procedure and was willing to proceed . the patient otherwise complained of no angina , no shortness of breath , no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no edema , no palpitations or symptoms of syncope . he did report a 20 lbs weight loss over the last several months . past medical history : 1. thoracic aneurysm repair . 2. hypertension . 3. status post hernia repair . medications on admission : 1. lopressor 100 mg po three times a day . 2. captopril 75 mg po three times a day . 3. prilosec 20 mg po per day . 4. hydralazine 12.5 mg four times per day . 5. reglan 10 mg po three times a day . allergies : no known drug allergies . family history : noncontributory . social history : the patient was married and denied any tobacco or alcohol use . physical examination : the patient was afebrile , vital signs were stable . head , eyes , ears , nose and throat exam : negative . neck was supple . there was no jugular venous distention . 2+ carotids without bruits . cardiovascular exam : regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 diastolic ___ and a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur . his lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without any evidence for crackles . extremities : the patient had 2+ femoral pulses and 1+ pedal pulses . laboratory and radiologic data : sodium 137 , potassium 4.0 , blood urea nitrogen 16 , creatinine .9 , white blood cell count 4.9 , hematocrit 29.7 , platelet count 207 . the patient 's preoperative chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis . physical examination : the patient 's sternal incision had a superior edge that was dehisced with evidence for stay sutures and some superficial closure sutures exposed . hospital course : the patient was initially admitted to the cardiac surgical service under dr. rhalt . the patient was admitted to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit given the patient 's precarious condition . over the next several hospital days the patient underwent aortogram as well as chest computer tomogram as outlined earlier . the patient was also seen in consultation by the infectious disease service as well as the cardiology service who assisted in managing the patient 's intermittent hypertension . the patient was also seen preoperatively in consultation by the plastic surgical service for potential sternal reconstruction . after lengthy discussions with the patient and the patient 's family as well as the various consultant services it was decided that the patient was a viable candidate for aortic root replacement procedure using homograft . this was obtained on 08/30/98 by dr. niste rhalt of the cardiac surgical service . the patient was then subsequently taken to the operating room on 08/31/98 with the preoperative diagnosis of ascending aortic graft infection . the procedure performed was homograft replacement of the ascending aorta with omentopexy and an open chest . the aortic perfusions were via the femoral artery with venous return by the femoral vein . the cardiopulmonary bypass time was one hour and 49 minutes . the graft used was a homograft . the patient tolerated the procedure fairly well and was transferred intubated to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit with his chest open . the immediate postoperative plans were for a short intensive care unit stay and subsequent plastic surgical reconstruction of the patient 's sternum . the patient was transferred to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit in stable condition . there he continued to be hemodynamically stable . of note , intraoperatively multiple tissue cultures had been sent . in the intensive care unit the patient was kept intubated and sedated until 09/02/98 which was postoperative day no. 1 following the homograft replacement . on that day the plastic surgical service performed further sternal debridement and subsequent reconstruction using bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flaps and right superiorly rectus abdominis flap to cover the patient 's sternal wound with subsequent primary closure of that wound . the patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications . a number of indwelling closed suction drains were left in place so as to drain the bed underneath the muscle flaps . the patient was then transferred back to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit in stable condition . at this point the patient continued to followed by infectious disease service and continued to be on intravenous antibiotics which included vancomycin and levofloxacin . the operating room cultures at that point were positive for crinobactermium with sputum cultures being sensitive for yeast and gram positive cocci in clusters . over the next postoperative day the patient was awakened and weaned to extubate without significant difficulties . the patient 's subsequent postoperative course was characterized by persistent hypertension which required a significant amount of antihypertensives including lopressor 100 mg po three times a day , captopril 100 mg po three times a day , as well as procardia . the patient otherwise continued to do well and was becoming more oriented as time went on and as his blood pressure was brought under control . subsequently on postoperative day no. 8 in the intensive care unit the patient was felt to be ready for transfer to the cardiac surgical inpatient service . the patient continued to be followed by the infectious disease service who felt that the patient 's jackson pratt drains needed to stay in as there was still some significant drainage from them . as per the infectious disease service the patient was continued on levofloxacin , vancomycin as antibiotic coverage . however on 09/08/98 the infectious disease service was made aware that the patient 's intraoperative cultures had also grown out mycoplasma humilius . given this finding it was felt that the patient would certainly need long term intravenous antibiotics to include at least six weeks of vancomycin and then subsequent levofloxacin for the citrobacter and mycoplasma as well . the patient was scheduled for peripherally inserted central catheter line placement knowing that he was going to need long term intravenous antibiotics . this was placed on postoperative day no. 9 without any difficulty . at the same time the patient continued to be stable on his antihypertensive regimen . he was becoming more mobile and was taking a high protein high calories diet which he tolerated well . he continued to be afebrile and otherwise very stable . on postoperative day no. 12 the patient was noted to have fallen and subsequently dislocating the pip joint of his left middle finger . subsequent hand x-rays obtained showed no evidence of fracture but the patient was seen in consultation by the plastic surgery hand service . the patient will benefit from splinting of his finger while the swelling subsided and subsequent early mobilization to prevent any rigidity in that joint . the patient was also seen subsequently in consultation by the plastic surgical service who discontinued a number of the patient 's indwelling drains but they felt that others needed to stay while the patient was sent to rehabilitation . these drains will then be subsequently taken out by dr. general upon his followup with the patient . prior to discharge the patient also underwent an audiogram as a baseline hearing test while the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics . the patient otherwise continued to be hemodynamically stable making good progress . as a matter of fact the patient made remarkable progress given the severity of his disease condition prior to the operation . the patient 's condition continued to be improved . given this finding the patient was therefore felt to be ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on 09/13/1998 . in consultation with the infectious disease service the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics . condition on discharge : good . discharge instructions : diet : high calorie , high protein . the patient 's treatment will include typical peripherally inserted central catheter line care with frequent wound checks . the patient prior to discharge was fitted with an orthoplast finger splint as manufactured by occupational therapy services fairm of ijordcompmac hospital . the patient was also instructed in range of motion exercises for the left middle finger . the patient on discharge is to have twice weekly vancomycin peak and trough levels while he continues on long term vancomycin therapy . the patient was instructed to return to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital if he developed any signs of wound infection such a erythema , drainage , or increasing incisional pain . the patient was instructed to be vigilant for any fevers or chills . medications on discharge : 1. vancomycin 750 mg intravenous q 18h. 2. levofloxacin 500 mg po per day . 3. prilosec 20 mg po per day . 4. captopril 100 mg po three times a day . 5. lopressor 100 mg po three times a day . 6. albuterol nebulizers q6h as needed . 7. atrovent nebulizers q6h as needed . 8. lasix 20 mg po per day . 9. kay-ciel 20 meq po per day . followup : the patient was instructed that he needed to followup with dr. rhalt by calling his office for appointment at 763-6361 subsequent to his discharge to his rehabilitation facility in oaksale lavalle . the patient was also instructed to followup with dr. both of the cardiology service fairm of ijordcompmac hospital following his discharge so that his antihypertension medications could be appropriately adjusted . the patient will also be seen in followup by dr. chpo e. enla general of the plastic surgery service fairm of ijordcompmac hospital so that his indwelling jackson pratt drains be appropriately management and if needed be discontinued by him . the patient will also be followed by the infectious disease service so as to ascertain the exact length and course of his antibiotic therapy . the patient was instructed to followup with dr. naco mesprhalt of the infectious disease service by calling her office for an appointment at 094-902-2879 to be seen in approximately four weeks following the patient 's discharge . dr. dau 's recommendation is that the patient is to stay on vancomycin and levofloxacin for approximately six weeks following discharge and then subsequently on antibiotic regimen for chronic suppression . ryna dau , m.d. dictating for : niste ma rhalt , m.d. tr : oq dd : 09/13/1998 td : 09/13/1998 7:18 a cc : kend n both , m.d.

history of present illness : riie pruesschird is a 25 year-old gentleman with metastatic angiosarcoma who presents as a transfer from nacalv medical center with a fever to 101 , vomiting times one and \" left kidney pain \" . this patient is an unfortunate young gentleman who was initially diagnosed with a germ cell tumor in the fall of 1997 after undergoing orchiectomy with a left scrotal mass and underwent three cycles of dep therapy for pulmonary involvement . in the summer of 1998 he was found to have a retroperitoneal mass which ultimately revealed angiosarcoma of presumed germ-cell transformation . in early 1999 he underwent resection of this mass however in february of 1999 he was found to have a new right pleural mass and subsequently underwent pleurodesis and chemotherapy with ifosfamide and adriamycin for six cycles . in 05/99 he had increasing abdominal pain and evaluation revealed extensive progressive retroperitoneal disease as well as left hydronephrosis . in early 2000 he was started on therapy with taxol per dr. azel hibbskays and finished this in march of this year . ct imaging at that time was negative for disease . in april of this year , he was found to have acute renal failure with left hydronephrosis and this was treated with percutaneous nephrostomy tube on that side . thereafter he began chemotherapy with taxotere in 05/13 and his nephrostomy tube was removed after being displaced on 06/14/00 . most recently he has had problems with nausea , vomiting , fever and left sided abdominal pain and was admitted to the pointexasp region general hospital on 06/16/00 . that hospital course was sign for hydration , antibiotics for questionable pneumonia and more importantly , tachycardia and respiratory distress ultimately secondary to a large left pulmonary arterial mass that was likely a thrombus . he was treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis ( tpa ) and was discharged on 06/28/00 on high dose , low molecular weight heparin . it was entirely clear that this mass represents a clot , certainly this could have been tumor embolization . finally , the patient developed hyponatremia with a sodium down to 130 and was otherwise eventually discharged to pre health with morphine for comfort care and advanced care plans , not to be resuscitated in the event of a life-threatening situation . mr. pruesschird returns tonight after being found to have a temperature of 101 , last evening and early this morning in addition to nausea , vomiting times one earlier today . as well he has complained of some vague left abdominal / flank pain that he attributes to \" kidney pain \" . he was given flagyl and had already apparently been on levofloxacin at the outside hospital since his recent discharge for questionable pneumonia . mr. pruesschird denies headaches , chest pain and any change in his breathing or comfort with breathing . he denies persistent vomiting , abdominal pain , other than as mentioned , new skin changes or diarrhea . there is no joint swelling or tenderness . he otherwise feels about the same as when he left the hospital recently except for his left abdominal flank pain . past medical history : essentially unremarkable . he did have some peripheral neuropathy related to his chemotherapy for testicular cancer . allergies : he is allergic to erythromycin . medications on admission : magnesium , lovenox 130 mg q 12 hours , multivitamin one tablet p.o. q day , potassium supplement , flagyl and levofloxacin . social history : significant for being from the sahassbo dalenah area . he has been on disability . he lives with his father and step-mother . his mother lives in ka brown and has been therefore the past few years . he has a sister who is 23 and a father who visits him in the rehabilitation facility daily . he does not smoke or drink alcohol . family history : family history otherwise is unremarkable . physical exam : temperature 100.2 , pulse 130 , blood pressure 106/56 , room air saturation 97 percent . respirations of 16 . he is alert and attentive with somewhat of a flat affect . pupils equal , round and reactive to light and accommodation . extraocular movements intact . his sclera are anicteric . oropharynx is clear without lesions . no lymphadenopathy . cardiac : tachycardic with a regular rhythm without murmurs or rubs . radial pulses are 2 plus and equal . lungs : crackles and decreased breath sounds in the right posterior field . there is no wheezing . his abdomen is soft . markedly decreased bowel sounds . there is no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly . there is tenderness with mild flank palpation in his left hypogastrium and upper quadrant as well as some left flank tenderness . there is no skin changes . he has no peripheral edema . he does have a left port-a-cath that does not appear to be erythematous or with discharge . laboratory data on admission : sodium 133 , potassium 4.4 , bicarbonate 22 , chloride 100 , bun 10 , creatinine 1.1 ,

urinalysis showed 80 white blood cells . hospital course : upon presentation the patient was on levofloxacin and flagyl for broad spectrum antibiotic coverage . he continued to run fever in the 101 range . the patient 's urine cultures showed 100,000 colonies of mixed flora . he had negative blood cultures . flagyl was discontinued . white blood cell count elevation was thought to be due to leukemoid reactions . his fevers were felt to be possibly secondary to tumor . after a long discussion with his primary oncologist , the patient decided to be dnr / dni with comfort measures only .

{"id": 28, "label": "unknown", "text": "principal diagnosis : severe blunt abdominal trauma . associated diagnosis : 1. grade ii / v laceration of liver , 2. rupture of left renal vein , 3. tear of transverse mesocolon , 4. serosal tear of transverse colon , 5. blunt fracture of the neck of the pancreas . history of present illness and hospital course : mr. breath was a 32 year old previously healthy unbelted driver whose car was hit at high speed by a vehicle driven by an intoxicated driver . the patient was ejected and his vehicle rolled over , possibly over him . he was found awake at the scene , complaining of abdominal pain . he had a blood pressure of 60 systolic upon arrival of the giles min general hospital crew . intravenous fluids was given . he was paralyzed and endotracheally intubated , and a 14 gauge catheter was inserted in his left chest because of poor breath sounds . he arrived at the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital at 02:30 with a blood pressure of 86 and a heart rate of 170 . large bore cannulas were inserted into the femoral veins , bilateral chest tubes were placed , and his blood pressure rose to 110 systolic after two liters of crystalloid . he had an ecchymosis over the medial right costal margin and his abdomen was distended . his hematocrit was 36 , and creatinine 1.6 . the abdominal tap was grossly positive for blood . his blood pressure fell to 60 systolic as he was being transferred to the computerized tomography scan table ; the scan was aborted and he was taken directly to the operating room at 03:00 . at laparotomy , there was a liter of blood in the peritoneal cavity . there was a class ii laceration of the left liver at the falciform ligament which was actively bleeding , a tear of the transverse mesocolon from its base to the bowel wall with active bleeding , a 7 cm serosal tear of the adjacent transverse colon , and a large central retroperitoneal hematoma . control of the super-celiac aorta was obtained , and both left and right sided \" mattox \" maneuvers were performed . the retroperitoneum was opened , with vigorous bleeding resulting . this was controlled , necessitating ten minutes of aortic clamping and found to have originated from the rupture of the left renal vein one centimeter from its junction with the inferior vena cava . the vein was divided and suture ligated . bleeding from the liver was controlled with sutures . the tears in the transverse mesocolon and colon serosa were repaired . the examination of the remainder of the abdominal contents revealed no other injury ; in particular , the entire anterior surface and the immediately juxtaduodenal posterior surface of the pancreas were normal . the patient was now very stable , and he was taken to the respiratory intensive care unit . the patient had received ten units of packed red blood cells , five units of fresh frozen plasma , seven units of platelets , and nine liters of ringer 's lactate . an intracranial pressure monitoring bolt had been placed by the neurosurgery service staff during the laparotomy . intracranial pressures were normal . that day , cranial computerized tomography scan and cervical spine films were normal . an arch aortogram was normal . over the ensuing twenty-four hours , bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray with poor oxygenation and labile blood pressure requiring pa line guided fluid and pressors developed . the patient had a large fluid requirement with total body capillary leak , decreasing svr , oliguria unresponsive to lasix / mannitol accompanied by a rise in creatinine to 3.2 , worsening ards , a rise in temperature to 103 , and a serum amylase of 1265 . he was returned to the operating room on july 4 . three liters of clear green fluid were found in the abdominal cavity . exploration of the pancreas revealed a posterior fracture a the superior mesenteric vessels . because of the intense diffuse inflammatory reaction that had already set in , it was decided that neither distal pancreatic resection nor roux-en-y drainage was feasible . four large flat jackson-pratt drains were placed , and gastrostomy , jejunostomy , and cholecystostomy tubes , as well as a right subclavian quinton catheter were placed . the patient 's hemodynamics had improved markedly with the evacuation of the peritoneal pancreatic fluid , so that he was no longer on pressors . however , upon transfer from the operating room table to the ricu bed , he suffered a cardiac arrest , which upon investigation was a primary respiratory arrest ; the initial arterial blood gas was 32/88/6.92 . he was successfully resuscitated after fifteen minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and he was taken to the ricu . continuous venovenous hemodialysis was started on july 5 , and continued for most of the remainder of the patient 's course . vancomycin , flagyl , and aztreonam were given for gram negative coccobacilli ( later identified as bacteroides ) that had grown in his blood cultures and gram negative rods ( enterobacter ) in his peritoneal fluid . he was kept sedated and paralyzed because of his severe adult respiratory distress syndrome . total parenteral nutrition was started on july 5 . initial improvement was followed by recurrence of low svr , high cardiac output , ongoing acidosis , requiring norepinephrine infusion in the 30 to 40 mcg per minute range ;

is referred for progressive angina . she had rheumatoid fever as a child and a heart murmur noted but no further testing . she has used antibiotic prophylaxis since 1980 . in 1980 she had quadruple coronary artery bypass graft surgery by dr. elks at feargunwake otacaa community hospital and did well until 1988 when she had exertional angina and a positive stress test and found that three or four grafts were occluded . in october , 1989 , dr. no re-did her bypass operation . she had a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 2 . in 1993 she had a ddd pacemaker for complete heart block . she had exertional angina at that time . in november , 1997 she had a small myocardial infarction as was transferred to ona hospital where a cardiac catheterization showed a tight left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending stenosis , high grade saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 stenosis and patent obtuse marginal 2 graft . she had normal left ventricular function with apical tip akinesis . since that time she has continued to have exertional left chest burning , radiating to the left neck and arm , relieved by nitroglycerin . she was turned down for re-do surgery at that time and did not have a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty . because these symptoms have been increasing , particularly at cardiac rehabilitation , she was referred here . in may , 1998 she had an exercise tolerance test in which her heart rate went to 112 and her blood pressure fell to 95 systolic . she had diffuse ischemic st segment changes and increased lung uptake and a reversible anterior and lateral defect . she has had no syncope . her cardiac risk factors are hypertension and elevated cholesterol . she has a very strong family history of coronary artery disease with a mother , sister and brother dying of myocardial infarction . she is a remote cigarette smoker . she also has a history of lactose intolerance , peptic ulcer disease , with a remote gastrointestinal bleed and multiple ectopic pregnancies and mid term miscarriages . she has had a total abdominal hysterectomy . social history : she is a widow for 20 years and retired 18 years from palmci she lives alone . her son , nertland is nearby and he works at the em nysonken medical center on verville . they live in ohio . physical examination : she is a healthy appearing female , 5 foot 120 pounds . her blood pressure was 120/70 , pulse 60 and regular . neck veins are not distended . respiratory rate 12 . carotids : no bruits . lungs were clear . cardiac : 1/6 systolic ejection murmur . abdomen was benign . peripheral pulses intact . neurological examination non-focal . laboratory data : on admission , includes an electrocardiogram that shows ddd pacing . hematocrit 39 percent , white blood cell count 4500 , pt and ptt normal . sodium 140 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 105 , carbon dioxide 30 , bun 24 , creatinine 1.0 . hospital course and treatment : the patient was admitted to the cardiac catheterization laboratory . there , her pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure 44/17 . her left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with dyskinesis of the apex . she had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction . her native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was an obtuse marginal branch . the saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded . the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded . the saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with no significant stenosis , but there was an outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery . this was considered her culprit lesion . this was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft . in addition , it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs . her left internal mammary artery was also unused . it was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead . she would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing . this was intermittent . the p wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed . the patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker . it was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure . her pacemaker was set to a vvi mode which sensed appropriately . she was in sinus rhythm with most of the time . when her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker , she had significant angina . carotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable . the situation was reviewed with dr. niste graft . he felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction . for this reason , it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates . the situation was reviewed with dr. no of the pacemaker service . on august 20 , under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a cpi unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .15 mm. , which permitted appropriate atrial sensing . there was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads . it just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode . she tolerated this well . her medications were resumed . she ambulated without difficulty and was discharged to home to be followed medically for her coronary artery disease following two

disease transferred to the fih for further care for cardiogenic shock . mr. given had an anterior myocardial infarction in 1981 . he had inferior myocardial infarction in february 1992 . his course was complicated at that time by hypertension and an echocardiogram showed an lv ejection fraction of 0.10 to 0.15 . in august , 1993 he had an out of hospital cardiac arrest . he rule in for another myocardial infarction at that time . he was transferred to the fih where he underwent a work up of both his arrhythmia and his heart failure . an automatic implantable defibrillator was placed . he was thought to be a good candidate for a transplant at that time as coronary arteriography showed diffuse disease in the lad and right coronary arteries as well as a proximal circumflex stenosis . because of the diffuse nature of the disease and the left ventricular dysfunction , mr. given was thought not to be a revascularization candidate and was listed for a transplant . mr. given waited as an outpatient for the availability of a donor heart . he was admitted to the hospital in late april with multiple episodes of bloody diarrhea . colonoscopy demonstrated severe crohn 's disease with sparing of the rectum . a perirectal fistula was seen . treatment with iv corticosteroids led to improvement and mr. given was discharged from the hospital ten days ago . on the evening of april 22nd , mr. given developed progressively worsening dyspnea . he presented to the iming medical center emergency room on the morning of april 22nd with hypertension and dyspnea . he was given intravenous fluid to support his blood pressure and developed pulmonary edema and was intubated . hypertension continued and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed . he is now being transferred to the fih for further treatment . physical examination : physical examination on transfer was remarkable for a blood pressure of 80/56 and a heart rate of 124 . his cvp was 16 . he was on the balloon pump at the time . his chest was clear anteriorly . his cardiac exam was remarkable for a summation gallop . no murmur was auscultated but the high heart rate did diminish the possibility of this . his abdomen was soft and he had no extremity edema . his feet were cool but there were pedal pulses bilaterally . laboratory data : admission laboratory studies included a hematocrit of 34.3 and a white count of 25,700 . the sodium was 126 , the bun 80 and a creatinine of 4.6 . electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia with an intraventricular conduction defect . there were inferior q waves consistent with an old infarct . the chest x-ray revealed mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly . hospital course : mr. given was admitted to the hospital and it was hoped that his end organ dysfunction would improve with a period of ballooning and improved perfusion such as to allow transplantation to eventually take place . he was maintained on levophed as a vasopressor as well as dopamine and dobutamine . it was noted that his intra-aortic balloon pump was only a 30 ml pump , and on the day after admission , mr. given was taken to the catheterization laboratory where this was exchanged for a 40 ml pump . after replacement of the intra-aortic balloon pump , mr. given remained critically ill , although there was some improvement in his augmented diastolic pressure . he did develop atrial fibrillation , however , which led to hemodynamic decompensation with a wedge pressure of 32 and a cardiac index of 1.6 . it was hoped that with continued inotropic support this would improve . he also remained intubated . mr. given was seen by dr. farstshuff of the gi service for advice regarding his crohn 's disease . all of these issues , including his acute renal failure , were thought to be contraindications to transplantation . as mr. given did not have any bowel sounds , he did have to remain on nasogastric suction . he was seen in consultation by dr. needs of the renal unit . dr. needs felt that the patient had had ischemic acute tubular necrosis and that we could continue to administer diuretics in a an effort to take off volume , but that we did have to allow time to pass in order to see improvement . procainamide was begun in an effort to convert mr. given to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation . initially he was in and out of sinus rhythm , but paroxysmal atrial fibrillation did occur frequently . as mr. given 's renal function did not improve , he was begun on continuous venovenous hemodialysis . this resulted in a reasonable clearance of creatinine . he was able to get some fluid off as well . with getting some volume off , the patient 's ventilation improved , as did many of his other metabolic parameters . his cardiac index had also improved with this to 2.7 , although he was on dobutamine as well . on 6/19 an effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump . with a decrease in the counterpulsation ration , he developed atrial flutter with a fall in blood pressure and cardiac index . the balloon pump was restored . he was continued on this as well as on dobutamine and amrinone support . he continued on hemodialysis , but had little urine output . supportive care continued . unfortunately , the white blood count began rising , raising the possibility of sepsis . broad spectrum antibiotics to cover potential sources in the gastrointestinal tract were begun and ciprofloxacin was added . mr. given 's blood pressure appeared to stabilize . another effort was made on 6/22 to attempt to wean the balloon , but this led to an increase in his wedge pressure and a fall in his arterial pressure , and this was stopped and he was restored to full counterpulsation . he had been able to be transiently extubated after dialysis had reduced his lung water , but he had to be reintubated on 6/24 . hemodialysis continued with maintenance of reasonable metabolic parameters . he did develop worsening metabolic acidosis . his hemodialysis was adjusted in an effort to resolve this . he continued on vancomycin , ciprofloxacin , zosyn , and fluconazole antibiotics . another effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump on 6/26 . this resulted in a fall in his cardiac index , but his blood pressure and wedge pressure were stable . he did have runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia . on 6/29 mr. given began developing periods of hypotension . the patient stated that he did not want to be reintubated , as it became quite clear that he would not be a transplant candidate . he began having multiple runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia . the patient and his significant friend , incloztaua , had a long discussion with his physicians and they felt that , given the futility of his

of malignant pericardial effusion . patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy in 02/90 for a 4x3.6x2 cm cervical mass felt to be a fibroid at vanor . pathology revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix with spots of vaginal margins and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the cardinal ligaments with extensive lymphatic invasion . patient was felt to have stage 2b disease and post-operatively , she was treated with intracavitary and external beam radiation therapy and low dose cisplatin . on ultrasound in 02/91 , the patient was found to have bilateral cystic adnexal masses confirmed on physical examination . she underwent exploratory laparotomy and had a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy . pathology was negative for tumor and showed peritubal and periovarian adhesions . the patient now presents with a three to four week history of shortness of breath and a dry non-productive cough . she was evaluated by dr. mielke , a pulmonologist , who found her to be wheezing and performed pulmonary function tests which showed an fev1 of 1.1 and an fvc of 1.8 . she was admitted to weekscook university medical center with a diagnosis of possible asthma . room air arterial blood gas showed a po2 of 56 , a pco2 of 35 , and a ph of 7.52 . ekg showed sinus tachycardia at 100 and echo revealed pericardial effusion , a 10 mm pulsus paradoxus was noted , and no evidence of tamponade . given the patient 's history of cervical cancer , the pericardial effusion was felt most likely to be malignant . she was therefore transferred to the retelk county medical center for further care . past medical history : as above . past surgical history : 02/90 , total abdominal hysterectomy complicated by ureteral transection with right ureteral tube placed for six weeks , stent tube placed in left ureter six weeks prior to admission for a hydronephrosis post , in 03/91 , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy . current medications : prednisone 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. with 10 mg p.o. q.p.m. , uniphyl 400 mg p.o. q.d. , augmentin 250 p.o. t.i.d. , estrase 2 mg p.o. q.d. , ms contin 30 mg q.12h. , and morphine p.r.n.

membranes and myotic pupils . neck : no lymphadenopathy . chest : few inspiratory wheezes and no rhonchi . heart : regular rate and rhythm with tachycardia and no rubs or murmur . abdomen : well healed pfannenstiel scars and no masses . pelvic : no masses . rectal : no masses and guaiac negative . extremities : no edema or cyanosis . laboratory examination : hematocrit was 40 , white count was 21 , and platelet count of 723,000 . pt and ptt were 12 and 26 . electrolytes were within normal limits , liver function tests within normal limits , and ekg showed a heart rate of 128 , axis 73 , and possible ectopic p . hospital course : the patient was admitted for a new pericardial effusion which was felt most likely to be secondary to metastatic cervical cancer . there was no evidence of tamponade . an echocardiogram was scheduled and cardiology was consulted . echocardiogram showed moderate anterior pericardial effusion of approximately 600 cc with diastolic indications of the right ventricle and low velocity paradox . cardiology did not feel that tamponade at this time was a concern and that a tap need not be performed . she continued to have pulmonary wheezing , unknown origin , without history of asthma . her steroids were tapered and pulmonary was consulted who recommended a ct scan of the chest to evaluate the lung parenchyma , induce sputum for cbc , arterial blood gas , continuing of the beta agonist inhalers , and trial of steroid inhalers . they felt it was most likely a malignant lymphangitic spread with pericardial involvement versus infectious , other cardiovascular causes , or viral bronchiolitis . she had pulmonary function tests repeated which showed an fev1 of 36% of predicted and fvc of 56% of predicted . room air arterial blood gas showed a ph of 7.45 , po2 of 63 , a pco2 of 41 , and fairly significant aa gradient . she was continued on two liters of oxygen awaiting her ct scan on 06/14 and she developed a new junctional rhythm with a question of a new rub versus murmur on examination . cardiology felt she had a rub and her pulsus was still 10 . ekg showed an ectopic low atrial p and they thought she was still stable without evidence of tamponade . she should have a follow-up echocardiogram . echocardiogram showed left ventricle at the upper limits of normal for size , low normal function , moderate to mild effusion with pericardial pressures exceeding right atrial pressures , and right ventricular pressures at various points of patient 's cycle without any change in the effusion from 06/11 . thoracic surgery was also consulted and they felt that there was no need for a pericardial window at the time . she should be continued with pulmonary oximetry testing . she underwent her ct scan . this showed lymphangitic spread of cancer in the chest , question of pulmonary nodules in the chest , pericardial effusion , multiple liver metastases , decreased function of the left kidney , dilated left intrarenal collecting system and proximal ureter , and periaortic lymphadenopathy . pulmonary felt this was consistent also with lymphangitic spread and they did not feel that a bronchoscopy would be of any assistance at this time . chemotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer was discussed with the patient and she was started on 5-fu 800 mg per meter squared days 06/18 , 06/19 , and 06/20 . she also received cisplatin 35 per meter squared on 06/19 and ifex and mesna on 06/18 . she was noted , on 06/16 , to have numerous erythematous maculopapules on her back and chest . dermatology was consulted and they felt that this was most likely steroid acne . they therefore felt a rapid steroid taper was indicated and topical erythromycin if desired by the patient . the patient 's shortness of breath and wheezing continued but without change . her cardiac examination remained the same and there continued to be no evidence of tamponade . cardiology felt that follow-up echo was indicated on 06/18 as she had another echocardiogram which showed no change or evidence of tamponade . they therefore felt that she could be continued to be followed by examination . she had some mental status changes with confusion and hallucinations on 06/18 originating from narcotics versus decreased po2 . the ifex was held as it was felt that it could have precipitated the mental status changes and that she was to receive no further ifex . she had no further hallucinations since stopping the ifex . psychiatry was also consulted to help her with the changes she was feeling since her new diagnosis . she was hooked up with support services in collot ln , dugo , indiana 68961 for further counselling and given xanax for symptoms of anxiety . she continued to have no change in her shortness of breath or cardiac examination and was discharged home on 06/22/91 after completing her 5-fu and cisplatin chemotherapy . disposition : she will be followed by dr. mielke and home care services . discharge

non-compliance versus other causes of increased blood pressure such as increased salt intake . the temporal proximity to paracentesis was initially worrisome for an underlying infection without precipitating hemodynamic imbalance , although no evidence of infection was established with any sputum , paracentesis culture or blood culture . given the extent of hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis

rhythm , no issues . his pr interval was watched as propranolol was started . there was no evidence of ischemia . pulmonary wise , he had some wheezing on exam . he was treated with inhalers . there was a suggestion of pneumonia on exam , but not on chest x-ray . gi wise , he underwent status post banding x 5 for bleeding esophageal varices . he was kept npo . he was started originally on

experienced an approximately 12 point crit drop with this bleed . for this , he was given 6 units of ffp , 4 units of packed red blood cells and platelets were kept greater than 60 with transfusion of platelets . he was also given vitamin k 10 mg. po x 3 days . he was treated with pneumoboots for dvt prophylaxis . he was kept in the medical intensive care unit for 24 hours during which time , his hematocrit remained stable and he had no other signs of continued gi bleed . at that point , he was transferred to carespistown hospital for further management . on his second day of admission , there was a concern about a developing pneumonia based on a worsening lung exam and also worsening cough , although sputum and all blood cultures remained negative for pathogens and the patient did not have a temperature spike . despite this , he was started on levoflox 250 mg. po qd on march 18th as well as flagyl 500 mg. iv tid for the possibility of an emerging aspiration pneumonia . the major therapeutic concern on the floor was diuresis . his aldactone was gradually titrated up to a maximum dose of 400 mg. per day divided in three even doses . in addition , lasix was added on to help him with diuresis . between march 20th and march 25th , he lost approximately 7 pounds on this regimen . however , after lasix was added back on , his creatinine rose from approximately 1.4 up to 1.7 and lasix was held for 24 hours . at that time , a dose of 20 mg. iv bid was re-instigated . on the 400 mg. of aldactone , his potassium remained in the high normal range around 5.0 . therefore , on march 25th , his aldactone was decreased to 100 mg. po tid and lasix was kept at 20 mg. bid . on this regimen , his weight remained approximately stable . he was also kept on a low salt diet . he was also kept on a 2 liter per day fluid restriction . by march 26 , 1998 , he was ready to discharged back to ant sonroeinland medical center , although he would stay in the medical unit there before returning back to his own room . at discharge , the active issues still to be dealt with at ant sonroeinland medical center are : 1. necessity of daily electrolytes and creatinine monitoring as his diuretic regimen was optimized . at discharge , he was on 100 mg. aldactone tid and 20 mg. of lasix bid but with potassium running in the high normal range necessitating daily electrolyte checks while the exact ratio of lasix to aldactone was optimized . 2. he also needs daily weight checks and daily abdominal exam to evaluate his fluid status . 3. he also needs tid fingerstick glucose to monitor his blood sugar . 4. in terms of his antibiotics , he has 4 days left of his flagyl 500 mg. q8hours . for sbp prophylaxis , he should be left indefinitely on levoflox 250 mg. po qd . 5. he should be enforced on a no concentrated sugars , low salt diet . 6. he also should have a 2 liter fluid restriction , if possible . 7. he should have initially twice a week checks of his hematocrit to make sure that his gi bleeding has stabilized . follow up : 1. he will follow up with his primary care physician , dr. portal , at ant sonroeinland medical center . doctor portal has been notified of the patient 's progress at tecal galecounxopt community hospital . 2. from our gi service , the patient will follow up with dr. shufftakeaakote and follow up will be arranged in gi clinic for next week . medications on discharge : 1. prilosec 20 mg. po bid . 2. zinc sulfate 220 mg. po qd . 3. isordil 10 mg. po tid . 4. lopressor 12.5 mg. po bid . 5. levoflox 250 mg. po qd . 6. atrovent nebs q8hours . 7. flagyl 500 mg. iv tid to stop on 3/31/1998 . 8. albuterol q4hour nebulizer treatments . 9. lactulose 30 cc. po bid . 10. aldactone 100 mg. po tid titrated to potassium . 11. lasix 20 mg. po bid . 12. nph insulin 14 units subq in the morning , 10 units subq in the evening as well as additional czi insulin based on tid fingersticks . addendum : unfortunately patient could not be discharged on 3/28/98 because , in the context of starting his lasix , his creatinine bumped overnight from 1.7 to 2.2 , possibly because of a progression of his hepatorenal syndrome . his potassium also climbed to 5.1 . because of this , we held all of his diuretics , namely his lasix and aldactone . despite holding his aldactone , his potassium continued to rise over the course of the next two days . it went as high as 5.8 on 3/29/98 . he was treated with kayexalate b.i.d. 30 gm. as treatment for this . by 3/31/98 his potassium had gone down to 4.0 . we then restarted a much smaller dose of aldactoneat 50 mg. po q day . this was the dose of aldactone he had originally been admitted with . on 3/31/98 the junior resident on drugway hospital , dr. asaleysean portal , had an extensive conversation with the patient about his future medical care . patient was very clear that he did not want any extraordinary measures done in case of acute illness . specifically he did not want to be intubated or have any of the acls protocol in the case of acardiac or pulmonary arrest . he also was very adamant that if he was to rapidly gi bleed , as from an esophageal bleed , that he did not want any extraordinary measures taken . specifically he did not want to be re-banded . we also addressed the possibility of having the gi service re-endoscope him in a few weeks to look at the progression of his esophageal banding . he said that he did not feel that that made any sense given his other comorbid disease . the patient was very adamant that in the future he would prefer to stay at the southnyra erwillte cinee memorial hospital where he is in residence . dr. asaleysean portal spoke with dr. fat of the ant sonroeinland medical center about this and that residence will make it clear that patient is not to be transferred back to an acute care facility in the case of decompensation . medications on discharge : lactulose 30 cc 's po b.i.d. , prilosec 20 mg. po b.i.d. , zinc sulfate 220 mg. po q day , isordil 10 mg. po t.i.d. , metoprolol 12.5 mg. po b.i.d. , levofloxacin 250 mg. po q day , atrovent nebs q8 hours , albuterol nebs q8 hours , and flagyl 500 mg. iv q8 hours with the last day 4/1/98 . patient will need no further antibiotics in his nursing home . he was also on aldactone 50 mg. po q day . we decided to discontinue his lasixas this had resulted in increase in his creatinine . at the southnyra erwillte cinee memorial hospital he will need daily weights as well as daily lytes , specifically potassium , bun and creatinine to make sure that he can safely tolerate this dose of aldactone . he should also have a low salt , low potassium diet without concentrated sweets and 2 liter fluid restriction . he will also need t.i.d. fingerstick glucose and he will follow up with dr. fat at southnyra erwillte cinee memorial hospital . asaleysean ilon portal , m.d. , ph.d. tr : imj dd : 03/27/1998 td : 03/26/1998 2:37 pcc : asaleysean ilon portal , m.d. ri miengre tlandmaul , m.d.

pupils were miotic , measuring 2 mm but responsive to light . neck - tender on the leftside with no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly . lungs were clear . chest actually had a 5 x 7 cm necrotic area on the left chest wall with some pus . cardiovascular - normal . abdomen - normal . there was no hsm . extremities - her left arm was very swollen . it was tested with no voluntary movement except at the finger tips . there was no edema elsewhere in her extremities , only the left arm . neuro - the patient was oriented to place , but had difficulty with recent memory . she also had mild weakness in the left extremities , both upper and lower . cranial nerves ii - xii were grossly intact . toes were downgoing . laboratory data : of note - na 133 , k 4 , wbc 8.82 , hematocrit 35.1 , platelets 229 . pt 13.8 with an inr of 1.3 , ptt 25.5 , total protein was 6.2 , albumin 3.4 , globulin of 2.8 , calcium of 9.1 , phos 2.7 , mag 2.1 , urea 3.7 . alt was elevated at 240 , ast 85 , ldh 305 , alk phos 85 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , direct bili was .8 . cholesterol 188 , triglyceride was 127 . ua - trace protein , trace ketones , positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1+ bacteria . chest x-ray - showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia . in summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell ca , status post chemotherapy with cmsap and pvsc and xrt who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall . the keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea . when she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with iv antibiotics . so she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her . also at the time of admission we were also considering palliative taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined . she refused the taxol therapy so that was not done . another major issue with this patient was pain control . she had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion . so pain control was a big issue so she was on ms contin and msir at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management . one of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at c6-c7 interface on 1-6-94 . after that the patient had minimal relief of pain . however , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her . so accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up . she is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch . she is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours . we can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain . other things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead ct for her on the 8th of january because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking . we went ahead and got a head ct scanand it showed no enhancing lesions . in addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that . that has been stable . the patient on january 13 became hyponatremic . her sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 . a renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as siadh . we proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it . we had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction . in addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient 's sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116. so that has really improved . we suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day . on the 14th of january , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with hampton 's hump . also a vq scan obtained the next day showed high probability for pe . so we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s. her inr is 2.3 . we want her inr to remain between 2 and 3 . so if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night . however , we would leave it at 2.5 for now . other major issues - as a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also . we put her on nifedipine ir , sl and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol . so on discharge she is on atenolol 100 . if needed to you can give her some nifedipine sl to decrease her blood pressure . the patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so i think that fluid restriction should help with that . she is also a little dry . the patient is on oxygen . ever since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen . she was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters . we would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well . the complications that i have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure . disposition : discharge medications - baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d. , mvi one tablet p.o. q.d. , mycostatin powder tp q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d. condition on discharge : fair . she remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema . she is to go to the necsoncardel medical center for more chronic care . follow-up is with dr. wedleung in the hem / onc in two weeks . the appointment has already been made . the patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain primarily and her difficulty breathing . dictated by : jeabriharl figefreiermfothgrendcajaque , m.d. attending : la inemacistin prontmandes , m.d. hd45 sy882/1177 batch : 020 index no. yjqi3j9vu6 d : 01/25/94 t : 01/25/94 "}

shortness of breath . he had no prior cardiac history until may 1993 when on 5-24 he had crushing chest pain which radiated to his left arm . he was found at that time to have 3-4 mm st segment elevations in v1 through v4 at pre health . the patient was transferred to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital and had 4-7 mm st segment elevations across the precordium with q's in v1 and v2 , 2 mm st elevation in avl , and 1-2 mm reciprocal st depression in ii , iii , and f. on physical examination at that time he had bright red blood per rectum and therefore lysis was deferred and he was taken directly to the cardiac catheterization lab . the cardiac catheterization results at that time revealed a right atrial pressure of 7 , pulmonary artery pressure of 29/16 , rv 33/8 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 . he had a 95% proximal left anterior descending lesion which was ptca 'd to a residual of 30% and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed . he also had some mild to moderate disease at the om1 noted at that time . the patient was transferred to the cardiac care unit where he had a peak cpk of 5,042 and 26.7% mb's . his intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned without problems . he had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started . on day six , an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 44% with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis . on day nine , he had a low level exercise tolerance test with thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in ii , iii , and avf , and 1.5 mm downsloping st depressions in v5 and v6 , as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on thallium . therefore , he went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal pda lesion and a circumflex lesion after the om . the patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with dr. shuffburle of gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with dr. amesin of cardiology and dr. shuffpasc of dingclearf alllirefaith memorial hospital . however , he did not keep any of these appointments . he went home and did not take any of his medications and smoked and drank heavily throughout the several months . on the a.m. of 10-24-93 , the patient developed crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath . he came to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital emergency ward where he was noted to be ashen and diaphoretic . he was treated with oxygen , aspirin , five sublingual nitroglycerins , heparin , and was eventually made pain free with that regimen . cardiac risk factors : his cardiac risk factors included hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , cigarette smoking , and a positive family history . past medical history : his past medical history included hypertension and non-insulin diabetes mellitus which is diet controlled . past surgical history : his past surgical history had included gastric ulcer surgery and appendectomy . medications on admission : on admission , he was on isordil 10 tid and enteric coated aspirin , but he was not taking either of these medications . habits : the patient smokes one pack per day and has a history of heavy alcohol use . physical examination : the physical examination on admission revealed a blood pressure of 110/70 , a heart rate of 66 , respirations of 24 , temperature of 98 . the heent exam revealed the extra ocular movements intact . the pupils equal , round , reactive to light . the oropharynx was clear and the fundi were normal . there were no hypertensive or diabetic changes . the neck was suppled , with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention . the carotids were 1+ without bruits . the heart was regular rate and rhythm , s4 , s1 , s2 , with a i / vi systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border . the lungs were clear , except for a few dry crackles bibasilarly . the abdomen revealed a midline scar and a right lower quadrant scar , and it was soft and nontender wit positive bowel sounds . the liver edge was 2 cm below the right costal margin , but smooth and nontender . there was no splenomegaly . the femoral pulses were diminished . he had bilateral intertrigo in his femoral region as well as his axillae . the extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema . the pulses were 1+ bilaterally . the skin exam revealed changes consistent with vitiligo . the rectal examination was guaiac negative . laboratory data : the laboratory data revealed normal electrolytes , bun and creatinine , normal liver function tests , a first cpk of 140 , and a hematocrit of 43.1 . the portable chest x-ray showed clear lungs , slight enlarged heart , and a mildly elevated hemidiaphragm . the electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 81 , with normal intervals and normal axis , had poor r-wave progression consistent with an old anterior myocardial infarction , had flipped t-waves in v1 through v5 , which were of no significant change since his last ekg on 5-25-93 . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the step down unit for a rule out mi protocol . he was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin . no beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110/70 . the patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak cpk of 219 and 20.9% mb fraction . this was a non-q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes . on 10-27-93 , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been ptca 'd , a lesion in the first om , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the om3 . the left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle . given the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the ptca , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient . he was ambulated progressively on the floor . a beta blocker was started with metoprolol initially at 25 mg po bid and eventually increased to 50 mg po bid . the patient ambulated extensively on the fih 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath . on 11-2-93 , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with thallium imaging . this treadmill test was done on medications , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment . the patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified bruce protocol , however , he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade . there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm st depression in ii , iii , and avf . the study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain . thallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle . there was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test . these images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous thallium images in may 1993 . after extensive discussion between myself , dr. amesin , and dr. scgach , it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management . the patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although he understands that this may become necessary in the future . dr. amesin had a long discussion with the patient 's daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient 's compliance . previously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments . the importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient . she will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with dr. amesin as well as dr. lfsquarc on the outside . the patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization . despite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done . he will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive

which was somewhat tender . the neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . laboratory data : included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta 's , 3 nucleated red blood cells . there were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . the platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . his prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . his uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his ldh was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , bun and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . a computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest x-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . there was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . an electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . he did spike a fever and began ancef and gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . he also tried amicar and continued on low dose prednisone . his headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea . there was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia . transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen . amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently . a bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his cmml to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous cystosine arabinoside and 6-thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions . he was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on allopurinol . the renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his gentamicin . the family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection . he was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose morphine drip which made him much more comfortable . they agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present . no autopsy was obtained . lenni breutzoln , m.d. tr : lj / bmot dd : 3/12/94 td : 03/13/94 cc
