{"id": 1, "label": 1, "text": "principle diagnosis : metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast . other problems : 1. hyponatremia , 1-13-94 . 2. pulmonary embolus , 1-14-94 . 3. diarrhea , nausea and vomiting , fever . 4. history of ovarian cyst resection , 1975 . history of present illness : the patient is a 49 year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with pbse and ccss support ending june 1994 . she was admitted on 1-5-94 for fever , chest wall ulceration , cellulitis and pain control . the patient first presented in october 1991 with a tender right axillary mass . a mammogram done in november 1990 was negative . however , mammography repeated in october 1991 showed bilateral breast masses , suspicious for carcinoma . fine needle aspiration on october 23 , 1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters . staging evaluation included normal liver function tests , normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray . bone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally . dr. berca gachfrum performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on november 4 , 1991 . the right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated , grade iii out of iii infiltrating ductal carcinoma . the margins were free of tumor , but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma . furthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer . the left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion . estrogen receptor was 0% by erica . the patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage . therefore she had a stage iii-a adenocarcinoma of the breast . since she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor , she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy . the patient was treated with cmsap , which is cytoxan , methotrexate , leukovoranrescue , 5-fu , adriamycin and prednisone for four cycles . there were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression . however , following cycle 4 , she developed a flu-like illness , followed by fever , nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion . abgs showed a po2 of 79 , ph 7.44 , po2 33 . chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates . the differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis , mycoplasma , chlamydia . basically in december 1993 , she returned to the hem / onc clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied . although she had mediastinal recurrence , bone scan , head and liver ct were negative for metastatic disease . she was thus started on a protocol of high dose chemotherapy with gcsf and peripheral stem cell support . complications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis . she also developed klebsiella uti after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy . it was treated with gent and cipro . re-staging done in april 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis . in may 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and velban and methotrexate , which required some red cell transfusions . in mid may she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a uti with blood clots in the urine . the patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100 . she has also been having diarrhea since november and her other complaints of admission include confusion , nausea and vomiting . we will include a very thorough hpi with this dictation that was done by dr. wedleung . past medical history : significant for metastatic breast cancer , complicated by fever and neutropenia . utis , obstruction of the right subclavian vein and right brachial cephalic vein , herpes zoster . status post ovarian cyst resection in 1975 . she had menarche at age 15 . she used the pill for five years in the past . she is g 2 , p 2 with spontaneous vaginal deliveries . she has a history of easy bruis ability . she is allergic to augmentin which gives her a rash . medications : ms contin , msir , and percocet . family history : noncontributory . social history : married with two children . she worked as an occupational therapist at a professional center for handicapped children . she denies tobacco and drug use and drinks ethanol socially . physical examination : a cachectic white female . t 100.1 , p 104 , blood pressure 130/90 , heart rate of 16 , she was sating 95% on room air . heent - pupils were miotic , measuring 2 mm but responsive to light . neck - tender on the leftside with no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly . lungs were clear . chest actually had a 5 x 7 cm necrotic area on the left chest wall with some pus . cardiovascular - normal . abdomen - normal . there was no hsm . extremities - her left arm was very swollen . it was tested with no voluntary movement except at the finger tips . there was no edema elsewhere in her extremities , only the left arm . neuro - the patient was oriented to place , but had difficulty with recent memory . she also had mild weakness in the left extremities , both upper and lower . cranial nerves ii - xii were grossly intact . toes were downgoing . laboratory data : of note - na 133 , k 4 , wbc 8.82 , hematocrit 35.1 , platelets 229 . pt 13.8 with an inr of 1.3 , ptt 25.5 , total protein was 6.2 , albumin 3.4 , globulin of 2.8 , calcium of 9.1 , phos 2.7 , mag 2.1 , urea 3.7 . alt was elevated at 240 , ast 85 , ldh 305 , alk phos 85 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , direct bili was .8 . cholesterol 188 , triglyceride was 127 . ua - trace protein , trace ketones , positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1+ bacteria . chest x-ray - showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia . in summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell ca , status post chemotherapy with cmsap and pvsc and xrt who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall . the keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea . when she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with iv antibiotics . so she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her . also at the time of admission we were also considering palliative taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined . she refused the taxol therapy so that was not done . another major issue with this patient was pain control . she had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion . so pain control was a big issue so she was on ms contin and msir at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management . one of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at c6-c7 interface on 1-6-94 . after that the patient had minimal relief of pain . however , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her . so accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up . she is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch . she is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours . we can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain . other things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead ct for her on the 8th of january because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking . we went ahead and got a head ct scanand it showed no enhancing lesions . in addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that . that has been stable . the patient on january 13 became hyponatremic . her sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 . a renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as siadh . we proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it . we had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction . in addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient 's sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116. so that has really improved . we suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day . on the 14th of january , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with hampton 's hump . also a vq scan obtained the next day showed high probability for pe . so we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s. her inr is 2.3 . we want her inr to remain between 2 and 3 . so if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night . however , we would leave it at 2.5 for now . other major issues - as a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also . we put her on nifedipine ir , sl and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol . so on discharge she is on atenolol 100 . if needed to you can give her some nifedipine sl to decrease her blood pressure . the patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so i think that fluid restriction should help with that . she is also a little dry . the patient is on oxygen . ever since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen . she was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters . we would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well . the complications that i have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure . disposition : discharge medications - baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d. , mvi one tablet p.o. q.d. , mycostatin powder tp q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d. condition on discharge : fair . she remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema . she is to go to the necsoncardel medical center for more chronic care . follow-up is with dr. wedleung in the hem / onc in two weeks . the appointment has already been made . the patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain primarily and her difficulty breathing . dictated by : jeabriharl figefreiermfothgrendcajaque , m.d. attending : la inemacistin prontmandes , m.d. hd45 sy882/1177 batch : 020 index no. yjqi3j9vu6 d : 01/25/94 t : 01/25/94 "}

coronary artery bypass graft surgery by dr. elks at feargunwake otacaa community hospital and did well until 1988 when she had exertional angina and a positive stress test and found that three or four grafts were occluded . in october , 1989 , dr. no re-did her bypass operation . she had a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 2 . in 1993 she had a ddd pacemaker for complete heart block . she had exertional angina at that time . in november , 1997 she had a small myocardial infarction as was transferred to ona hospital where a cardiac catheterization showed a tight left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending stenosis , high grade saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 stenosis and patent obtuse marginal 2 graft . she had normal left ventricular function with apical tip akinesis . since that time she has continued to have exertional left chest burning , radiating to the left neck and arm , relieved by nitroglycerin . she was turned down for re-do surgery at that time and did not have a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty . because these symptoms have been increasing , particularly at cardiac rehabilitation , she was referred here . in may , 1998 she had an exercise tolerance test in which her heart rate went to 112 and her blood pressure fell to 95 systolic . she had diffuse ischemic st segment changes and increased lung uptake and a reversible anterior and lateral defect . she has had no syncope . her cardiac risk factors are hypertension and elevated cholesterol . she has a very strong family history of coronary artery disease with a mother , sister and brother dying of myocardial infarction . she is a remote

a total abdominal hysterectomy . social history : she is a widow for 20 years and retired 18 years from palmci she lives alone . her son , nertland is nearby and he works at the em nysonken medical center on verville . they live in ohio . physical examination : she is a healthy appearing female , 5 foot 120 pounds . her blood pressure was 120/70 , pulse 60 and regular . neck veins are not distended . respiratory rate 12 . carotids : no bruits . lungs were clear . cardiac : 1/6 systolic ejection murmur . abdomen was benign . peripheral pulses intact . neurological examination non-focal

105 , carbon dioxide 30 , bun 24 , creatinine 1.0 . hospital course and treatment : the patient was admitted to the cardiac catheterization laboratory . there , her pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure 44/17 . her left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with dyskinesis of the apex . she had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction . her native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was an obtuse marginal branch . the saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded . the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded . the saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with no significant stenosis , but there was an outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery . this was considered her culprit lesion . this was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft . in addition , it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs . her left internal mammary artery was also unused . it was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead . she would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing . this was intermittent . the p wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed . the patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker . it was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure . her pacemaker was set to a vvi mode which sensed appropriately . she was in sinus rhythm with most of the time . when her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker , she had significant angina . carotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable . the situation was reviewed with dr. niste graft . he felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction . for this reason , it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates . the situation was reviewed with dr. no of the pacemaker service . on august 20 , under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a cpi unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .15 mm. , which permitted appropriate atrial sensing . there was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads . it just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode . she tolerated this well . her medications were resumed . she ambulated without difficulty and was discharged to home to be followed medically for her coronary artery disease following two

then , dr. thorebreutz took him to the operating room , where he had quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting . he had a left internal mammary artery graft of the lad , a single saphenous vein to the right coronary artery with 280 cc per minute flow , and a saphenous vein snake graft to the diagonal and circumflex with 150 cc per minute flow . a paraphimosis was noted and treated by dr. ryna jescdrig . after surgery he had a ongoing sinus tachycardia . he was able to be rapidly weaned and extubated . he had good hemodynamics . he had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats . his intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the surgical intensive care unit . he was seen in consultation by the nutrition service , who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus . on 08/05 it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous heparin and indeed , when heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal . therefore , he does have a thrombocytopenic reaction to heparin . he remained in normal sinus rhythm . he did have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , which were clinically stable . he had a right bundle branch block . he is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction , but he is clinically stable on ace inhibitors , digoxin , coumadin , and aspirin . therefore he was able to be discharged home . he understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin times and his arrhythmias ;

cerebrovascular accident and no evidence of acute blood . mra / mri revealed a left internal carotid artery aneurysm about 7 mm. in width . hospital course : the patient was admitted to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital where a four vessel cerebral angiogram was performed on 01/13/92 . this revealed a lobulated aneurysm at the p. comm. origin on the left . this was a left internal carotid artery aneurysm . the internal carotid arteries and middle cerebral artery showed irregularity of caliber probably due to atherosclerosis . after much discussion , endovascular treatment with gd coils were recommended . the patient underwent coiling on 01/14/92 . this showed that 60-70% of the distal aneurysm was obliterated by the coils . one coil protruded into the lumen of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm . it was thought that the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage was low but still substantial from the untreated proximal lobe . also the risk of ischemia or infarct from the internal carotid artery coil could lead to thromboembolism . therefore the lowest overall risk was thought to be a craniotomy to obliterate the aneurysm and possibly remove the protruding coil . therefore after discussion in detail with sister rora dose , a left pterional craniotomy was performed on 01/15/92 . at this time it was noted that the left internal carotid artery aneurysm was mostly within the cavernous sinus and the extracavernous portion was extremely atherosclerotic . therefore no clip was possible and the patient underwent a muslin wrapping of the aneurysm . the patient postoperatively was able to open her eyes to voice and name . her pupils were equal and reactive and she was able to localize with the left upper extremity as well as raise the right upper extremity above the bed . her consciousness as well as her strength improved gradually and the patient was referred for rehabilitation at a chronic care center . discharge diagnosis : subarachnoid hemorrhage

, there was no obstruction of free air . phleboliths were identified . pelvic ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis , 3 x 3 x 4 cm mass contiguous with posterior uterus , most consistent with a fibroid . the ovaries were not seen on the abdominal ultrasound . hospital course : cardiac : the patient had no prior history of cardiac disease . although the chest pain that she had could have represented ischemia , there was a low clinical suspicion for this . it was most likely felt that the patient 's chest pain was reflective of her abdominal gastroenteritis . however , she was admitted to a cardiac floor and put on telemetry and a myocardial infarction was ruled out by serial ck 's . the patient 's ck's were 233 , 198 and 132 . electrophoresis of the a set revealed no mb's . the patient 's ekg did not evolve . the patient has a long history of hypertension which has not been treated . during this admission , she was started on nifedipine for control of her blood pressure . gi : the patient presented with diffuse abdominal pain which was more pronounced in the left lower quadrant , nausea and vomiting . the differential diagnosis for this was felt to be a viral gastroenteritis , diverticulitis , degenerating fibroid , ovarian torsion and pelvic inflammatory disease . although the patient had cervical motion tenderness on admission physical exam , the gynecology service felt that the pelvic inflammatory disease was an unlikely diagnosis in this setting because the patient has had a tubal ligation in the past . the patient had an abdominal and pelvic ct scan at which time the ovaries were identified and were felt to be unremarkable . additionally , the uterus itself was felt to be normal . no diverticula were seen on the ct scan and no abscess was seen . after receiving 24 hours of iv fluids and hydration , the patient 's abdominal symptoms spontaneously resolved . she was taking po 's very well and had no further episodes of nausea , vomiting or emesis . at the time of discharge , she still had mild left lower quadrant pain on deep palpation only . infectious disease : at the time of admisison , the patient was afebrile and did not have a leukocytosis . however , blood cultures were drawn on admission . the patient had a total of four sets of blood cultures drawn . one set of blood cultures grew out group b strep and staph epi . as the patient was afebrile and had a normal white blood cell count , it was suspected that these cultures results were most likely a contaminant . two additional sets of blood cultures were drawn and the patient was empirically started on vancomycin and flagyl . after 48 hours , all other blood cultures remained negative and the patient continued to be afebrile . the antibiotics were discontinued , she was observed and remained afebrile . gynecologic : the patient had perimenopausal symptoms at the time of admission with hot flashes and irregular menstrual cycles . a fsh level was drawn and is pending at the time of dictation . the gynecology service would like to have follow-up with the patient for routine gynecologic exam , pap smear and estrogen replacement counseling in approximately three months . social : while in house , the patient was seen by social services . apparently , the patient lives alone and is without employment . she has no medical insurance . it was discussed that the patient should see the social service in outpatient kingsec li hospital . exercise treadmill : prior to discharge , the patient underwent ett . she exercised for three minutes and 40 seconds on the standard bruce protocol and achieved a peak heart rate of 138 and a peak blood pressure of 145/100 . this test was stopped because of leg and back pain . impression was that the study showed no evidence of ischemia . history of syphilis : the patient was treated for syphilis in the 1970's . rpr during this admission was reactive . the rpr titer itself was pending at the time of dictation . because of the positive rpr titer , fta was automatically sent off . however , the usefulness of the fta is questionable . the patient should have a follow-up of her rpr titer . disposition : medications : on discharge included procardia xl , 90 mg po q a.m . the patient was discharged home in stable condition . the patient will have follow-up in the kingsec li hospital with dr. boop on

history of parkinson 's disease x 's 18 years , prostate cancer , urinary incontinence and recent subdurals after fall . he reports lower abdominal pain x's 2 days . of note , he is a very poor historian given his difficulty speaking and inability to write from his parkinson 's disease . his wife noted him to be restless on the day of admission , felt warm , temperature to 102.5 . they went to a local hospital where he was found to have a temperature of 102.4 and blood cultures were done and he was transferred to ph university of medical center for admission . he was recently started on a texas catheter for urinary incontinence at home . he has no symptoms of shortness of breath , cough , diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , choking on food , no new medications . past medical history : as above . medications ; on admission were eldepryl , artane , prilodol , sinemet and opuputine . allergies : he had no known drug allergies . hospital course and treatment : the patient was admitted and started on ampingent intravenously . there was a question of aspiration pneumonia so he was switched from ampicillin pen-g to aspiration pneumonia . he was continued on his parkinson 's medications . a head ct was scheduled to rule out interval increase in subdurals . head ct results show full bilateral acute hemorrhage in his subdural hematomas , now with slight midline shift . dr. factor agreed he would review the cts and follow the patient while in house . he was seen by urology , who suggested to leave the catheter in for now in the setting of doubt ms . he was seen by neuro , who felt that the subdural hemorrhages should be followed and treated conservatively as well as precautions for fall and no further intervention was warranted given risk of re-bleed which is quite high with his atrophic changes . the patient 's mental status improved greatly after the onset of intravenous antibiotics , doing much better , was much more awake and alert and the plan was to possibly send him home on po antibiotics and full arnsperni health services . bedside swallow test was done which showed him to have some aspiration . he did have some recurrent fevers and his intravenous antibiotic were continued . thus , he was considered ready for discharge . he again became much more somnolent , there was a question whether he had re-aspirated . he again was becoming increasing febrile and somnolent while the patient was awaiting a chest x-ray and further evaluation . he was switched over the clinda and gentamicin for his aspiration pneumonia and again his mental status improved . on 8/10/97 , the patient became unresponsive and apneic . brachial consult was obtained and the patient was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit . he was found to be profoundly hypoxic with sats down to 60% on 100% facemask . he was hypotensive into the 80s . an electrocardiogram showed evolving inferior q wave with increased st segment and left anterior st depressions . rv leads were negative for st elevation . a chest x-ray showed marked congestive heart failure with increased heart size . a portable echo showed no pericardial effusion and his left ventricle was severely diffusely hypokinetic with septal dyskinesis . anterior and inferior akinesis , apical akinesis to the posterior lateral wall moved slightly . he had about 20% mild mitral regurgitation . the right ventricle was markedly dilated with a kinetic free wall and very decreased function in a marked incomplete closure of the tricuspid valve with wide open tricuspid regurgitation . he was transferred to the intensive care unit for his acute myocardial infarction with very likely multi-vessel disease with concominent left anterior descending severe stenosis or likely left anterior descending with collateral circulation from that occluded right coronary artery . the patient was also evaluated by neurosurgery , given the difficult situation , the patient was not a candidate for streptokinase or tpa given his chronic subdurals with a recent new bleed . he was evaluated by neurosurgery , who felt that if heparin could be avoided , that would be best . he was treated conservatively with intubation , control of heart rate and on dobutamine for pressure support . he was diuresed with lasix and diuril and was oxygenating fairly well while intubated . he surprisingly made it through the next 24 hours . he was dynamically stable on his dobutamine with improved oxygenation . the patient continued fairly stable while intubated . two days after the myocardial infarction he continued with stable blood pressure on a very small amount of dobutamine . he had diuresed very well with good oxygenation . his neurostatus was indeterminate given his sedation on the ventilatory . discussions with the family were ongoing regarding do not resuscitate and long term plan given his comorbidities . they were waiting appropriately for some information from the repeat echo after his myocardial infarction . an echo showed that there was not much improvement in cardiac function , both right or left ventriculus . they did at that time decide to make him do not resuscitate , but were interested in continuing supportive care to see how much he would bounce back . the repeat echo showed no improvement in left ventricle or right ventricle function with marked akinesis of many walls . the lack of meaningful recovery was much less likely . discussions were had with the family regarding withdrawal of ventilator support , which they very appropriately decided on given the low possibility of any meaningful recovery . he was extubated successfully and was breathing comfortably on his own . the patient was transferred back to the medical floor in stable , but very guarded condition . no further blood draws were done . the patient was made comfortable on a low dose of intravenous morphine with sectioning to prevent further aspiration . comfort measures continued until the day 8/19/97 , where mr. koteleebdils was found to be pulseless , without respirations . he was declared dead at 7:15 a.m. on 8/19/97 . the family and the attending

studies and overnight oximetry saturation monitoring . history of present illness : mr. bridge is an 81-year-old man with a history of restrictive and obstructive lung disease , dilated cardiomyopathy , inferior myocardial infarction , and anterior mediastinal masses admitted with acute onset of pulmonary edema . in the setting of inadvertently decreasing lasix from 80 mg. po 40 mg. a day mr. bridge had sudden onset dyspnea after approximate day and a half prodrome culminating in severe dyspnea . upon arrival in the emergency room mr. bridge 's saturations were in the mid 80s and he was promptly rendered more comfortable with high flow oxygen , morphine , and nitrates and intravenous lasix . chest x-ray was relatively unrevealing for interstitial or alveolar edema and with clinical improvement ensued with the immediate therapy in the emergency room as noted . the patient denied angina , syncope , preceding worsening orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations , chest pain , hematemesis or melena . past medical history : is notable for an inferior myocardial infarction , restrictive and obstructive lung disease with an fev1 of .9 and fvc of 1.34 and a moderate at best response to bronchodilators , and a negative sestamibi scan in december , 1999 apart from a severe fixed inferolateral defect , systolic dysfunction with recent echocardiography revealing an lvid of 62 mm. and ejection fraction of 28 percent , moderate mitral regurgitation and mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 33 and a mean gradient of 19 and a valve area of 1.4 cm. squared . in addition , mr. bridge has an anterior mediastinal mass 2x2x1.7 cm. by recent computerized tomography scan without surrounding or adjacent adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease apart from bronchiectasis . his cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ana , negative spep , upep and benz-jones proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative . the patient lives on ewi with his wife . he is a non-smoker and drinks rare alcohol . physical examination : the patient was a very pleasant man who appeared his stated age . blood pressure was 155/60 , heart rate 70 with occasional premature ventricular contractions , respirations 14 . mr. bridge was dyspneic speaking in short sentences initially on high flow oxygen . jugular venous pressure was 8 with a brisk inspiratory descent . there was no thyromegaly . carotids were 2+ . breath sounds were decreased at the bases only with distant heart sounds and a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur consistent with aortic stenosis with gallavardin like radiation to the apex . abdomen : soft , nontender with hepatosplenomegaly , or hepatojugular reflex , bruits or pulsations . there was no rash and no edema and the neurological examination was non-focal . laboratory data : notable for a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.6 , bun 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 104 , hematocrit 42 , white count 8.7 , platelet count 235 and a pt of 12.9 seconds . the urinalysis was negative . the troponin i was less than .4 and the creatine kinase was 114 . chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases . the electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations . after a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent . prior to catheterization a vq scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for pe with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung . subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and d-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent . it was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto . coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries . after a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute . based upon these findings it was felt that mr. bridge most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state . in hospital he was seen by both speech therapy , physical therapy , and the uspend harmemewood medical center congestive heart failure nurse practitioner program . his isordil was increased in hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 . future adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures . at a goal weight of 142 pounds , mr. bridge 's filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home . the patient will be followed by dr. fraction within a week of discharge and

patient lives alone , but in a senior living facility adjacent to friends . hospital course : 1 ) cardiovascular : the patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction . she remained on telemetry for greater than 48 hours which demonstrated no dysrhythmia during this time . the patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction with left ventricular hypertrophy and no significant valvular abnormalities . the patient was maintained on her aspirin and lasix . the patient 's diltiazem was stopped due to her increased blood pressure and was started on labetalol which was gradually titrated up to a target blood pressure of 160-170 systolic in her right arm . the patient also underwent an adenosine mibi stress test which showed only mild lateral ischemia . at this time , the patient 's presyncopal symptoms were not felt to be secondary to a cardiovascular etiology . 2 ) neurological / vascular : the discrepancy in the patient 's pulses and blood pressure was felt to be consistent with a subclavian artery stenosis . the patient underwent mri / mra of the head , neck and upper chest which demonstrated a proximal left subclavian artery stenosis , proximal to the take off of the left vertebral artery . the left vertebral artery had a decreased flow consistent with either native vessel disease or some degree of retrograde flow with subclavian steal phenomenon . the patient had patent carotids bilaterally on her neck mra . mri of the head demonstrated a small vessel disease and was likely an old right cerebellar infarct . the patient underwent non-invasive carotid ultrasounds which demonstrated no significant carotid disease . the patient was also noted to have antegrade flow in both of her vertebral arteries bilaterally . the results of these studies suggested that the patient 's symptoms were not due to subclavian steal phenomenon , and therefore , it was decided that the patient would not go further to angio and / or surgical or percutaneous intervention . a neurology consult was obtained and it was felt that the most valuable intervention that could be done for the patient 's intervascular disease would be adequate control of her blood pressure . 3 ) orthopedic : the patient suffered a fall at home with her initial event . outside hip films were obtained , but were not available for view . repeat hip films demonstrated a right sided pubic rami fracture , likely new . an orthopedics consult was obtained and the patient was encouraged to weight bear as tolerated with physical therapy assistance . a bone scan was also obtained to rule out an occult hip fracture which was negative . at the time of this dictation , the patient was able to bear weight with the assistance of physical therapy and a walker . plans were made for the patient to be discharged to dwardmegriff rehabilitation for rehabilitation of her rami fracture . 4 ) gastrointestinal : the patient had an episode of her described vertigo while lying in bed and on the monitor during which no dysrhythmia was noted . the patient also complained of frequent vomiting at least once a day , occasionally associated with ingestion of her medications , but sometimes associated with ambulation . the patient has a long-standing history of spontaneous emesis due to overwhelming stress or excitement . however , the patient reports emesis in the hospital more frequently . the patient 's emesis was noted to be bilious without evidence of new or old blood . the etiology of the patient 's nausea remained unclear as she demonstrated ability to keep down many of her meals which did not suggest an anatomical lesion of her gastrointestinal tract . the patient was started on meclizine on december 31 , 2000 for her nausea and vertigo . an attempt was also made to reduce the patient 's large number of medications and the patient 's os-cal , multivitamin , lasix and colace were discontinued . 5 ) infectious disease : the patient complained of some urinary incontinence and difficulty initiating urine on december 30 , 2000 . urinalysis demonstrated a likely urinary tract infection . the patient was started on levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q. day times seven days for a possible nosocomial urinary tract infection . the urine culture was pending at the time of this dictation . 6 ) fluids , electrolytes and nutrition : the patient

{"id": 61, "label": 0, "text": "principal diagnosis : thoracoabdominal aneurysm . associated diagnosis : hypertension . principal procedure : 2/17/94 : resection and grafting of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm . history : the patient is a 74 year old female who was involved in a motor vehicle accident on 11/18/93 at which time her workup revealed a large thoracoabdominal aneurysm at the eifro medical center which was evaluated with a chest x-ray and abdominal ct scan . at that time the patient denied any symptoms of aneurysmal pain and did not suffer significant injury from her motor vehicle accident . she was subsequently referred to dr. riode zetllille for evaluation and workup of her aneurysm . the patient underwent a thoracic abdominal arteriogram on 12/31/93 via a right femoral approach and she was noted to have a large descending aorta with tortuosity but no aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta . the patient was discharged after the procedure was performed and subsequently admitted in this hospitalization for elective resection . since the patient 's last admission she gives no history of chest or back pain and continues to be quite active . physical examination : on physical examination she is a well developed female in no distress . her head and neck examination is within normal limits . her lungs were clear to auscultation . her lung and pericardic examination is regular rate and rhythm . her abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended . she has a pulsatile upper abdominal mass . extremities : are well perfused and she has a small left inguinal hernia . she has a well healed right groin scar and pulse examination reveals 2 plus pulses from the carotids through the posterior tibial arteries bilaterally . neurologically she is awake and alert , she has normal cranial nerve function and her motor examination is within normal limits . laboratory data on admission : is remarkable for normal serum electrolytes with creatinine 1.2 , hematocrit 31.9 and normal coagulation studies . ekg reveals a normal sinus rhythm , normal intervals with slight left ventricular hypertrophy repolarization abnormality . her chest x-ray is remarkable only for a tortuous aorta on the anterior projection . hospital course : the patient was admitted and underwent resection and grafting of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm which she tolerated well . there were no intraoperative complications . she was taken to the surgical intensive care unit postoperatively . the patient 's procedure was also remarkable for the fact that she underwent spinal cooling during this procedure . the patient remained intubated postoperatively . she had a stable first postoperative day without evidence of hemodynamic or cardiopulmonary deterioration . on postoperative day 1 she had a slight hematocrit drop to 27.2 which was expected with hydration in addition to intraoperative volume loss but otherwise had an unremarkable course . epidural anesthesia was used throughout her course for pain management and she was transferred to the surgical floor on postoperative day two . the patient developed an episode of atrial fibrillation with physical examination consistent with only mild cardiopulmonary congestion as manifested by bilateral scattered rales in the lung fields . serum electrolytes at the time revealed normal potassium levels and the patient was treated with p.r.n. verapamil and digoxin therapy for a heart rate varying between 80 and 110 . the patient 's oxygen saturations continued to maintain at levels greater than 95 percent and this was felt to be well controlled and she was placed on digoxin chronically and also diuresed for therapy . she was transferred to the surgical floor where on postoperative day three she began to complain of hypersensitivity in the left lower extremity and inability to move her toes . this was a new finding considering postoperatively she had full motor and sensory function of all four extremities . neurologic assessment at the time did in fact reveal profound paresis of the left lower extremity only with absent reflexes but hyperesthesia to light touch throughout the lower extremities . laboratory data obtained revealed no significant changes from her initial postoperative levels . neurological consultation was obtained . it was felt that the patient had been subjected significant cord ischemia and possibly this neurologic event also related to spinal or epidural catheter placement . the epidural catheter had been removed prior to their evaluation and no return of significant function was noted over the ensuing two days aside from flexion and extension of the toes but still the patient maintained profound proximal lower extremity weakness . mri obtained did not reveal evidence of a structural cause for cord or root dysfunction and further recommendation of abdominal ct scanning in addition to emgs and sseps to further evaluate and confirm the site of the lesion be performed . the patient continued to do well otherwise being slowly progressed in her diet and mobilized from bed to chair without difficulty . she was placed on a bowel regimen to alleviate signs and symptoms of constipation while the workup to determine the exact etiology of her left lower extremity paresis could be identified . continued supportive care was performed for the patient as again she manifested no other significant signs of hemodynamic or neurologic deterioration . her ultimate diagnosis was subsequently felt to be a segmental infarction of the anterior and lateral part of her t10 level spinal cord and there was no evidence of that recovery of her left lower extremity would be obtained . social service consultation for rehabilitation placement was performed . the patient understands the ramifications of her disability and continued neurologic assessment is to be made . the patient continued to make slight gains in motor movement of the left lower extremity as manifested by digital function and some knee jerk return and by postoperative day eight she was manifesting some dorsiflexion in addition to urodynamics being performed revealed good detrusion contraction , normal sensation and a coordinated sphincter which suggested no disability to the sympathetic control of her bowel and bladder . the patient complained of some urinary incontinence and urgency on the 10th postoperative day . she was placed on bactrim therapy for e. coli positive urine culture and emg performed revealed a lesion proximal in the central nervous system ( cns ) consistent with central lesions . additional neurological follow-up will be maintained as the patient continues to rehabilitate in the on modenyheatl rowbrook of medical center . it is at this point encouraging that she continues to slowly regain some motor function of the left lower extremity but the patient has been advised that this may in fact not return . condition on discharge : is satisfactory . discharge diagnosis : (1) status post thoracoabdominal aneurysm grafting and resection . complications : during this hospitalization include left lower extremity paresis as well as e.

week prior to admission , the patient complained of severe constipation , dry mouth , possible urinary retention along with some nausea and vomiting . she felt that she was profoundly cold at the time . in the emergency room , the patient was hypotensive with an initial blood pressure of 92/70 and a pulse of 96 lying flat that became 70/50 with a pulse of 104 when standing . the patient was aggressively hydrated with a total of 9 liters of normal saline over a 7 hour period with marginal increase in blood pressure . over the same period of time , the patient became increasingly hypoxic and developed worsening hypertension . stat chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema . the patient was subsequently transferred to the micu on dopamine for further management . past medical history : only noticeable for remote appendectomy and being gravida v , para v . medications on admission : none . allergies : no known drug allergies . social history : the patient has an 80-pack-year history of tobacco and is currently smoking 1-2 packs per day . she also has a questionable alcohol history of up to one quart daily . she is married and lives with her husband . family history : notable for coronary artery disease in both parents without a history of cancer or autoimmune disease , diabetes , thyroid disease . physical examination : the patient was an agitated elderly white female . temperature 97.8 , blood pressure 112/58 on dopamine , pulse 134 , respirations 28 , oxygen saturation 93% on 100% nonrebreather . heent : showed pupils equal , round and reactive to light . extraocular muscles intact . oropharynx benign . eyebrows were notable for lateral thinning . neck was supple without lymphadenopathy . carotids were 2+ . no palpable thyroid . lungs showed decreased breath sounds bilaterally . cardiac exam revealed s1 , s2 with an intermittent s4 without murmur or rubs . abdominal exam was benign . extremities showed mild clubbing , no cyanosis and no edema . neurologic exam : the patient was alert , agitated and oriented to name , date and place moving all extremities . light touch was intact . admission labs : sodium 127 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 76 , bicarb 35 , bun 13 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 105 , serum osmolality 254 , hematocrit 43.5 , white count 10.0 with 68% polys , 20% lymphs and 10 monos . platelets 310 . pt and ptt were normal . lft 's were within normal limits . admission cortisol , aldosterone , b12 and folate and tsh were drawn . chest x-ray on transfer to the micu showed pulmonary vascular redistribution without infiltrate , effusions or nodules as compared with an admission chest x-ray which was interpreted as clear . hospital course : in the micu , the patient initially required dopamine for five days , at which point , she tolerated a wean without recurrent light headedness , dizziness or syncope . echocardiogram revealed preserved ejection fraction without regional wall motion abnormalities . the patient had a swan-ganz catheter placed which showed a cardiac output of 8 with systemic vascular resistance of 700 . because the swan-ganz readings were felt to be explained by sepsis , the patient was treated empirically with cefotaxime , gentamicin and flagyl . all cultures were subsequently negative with the exception of an e coli uti . the infectious workup included a lumbar puncture which was negative for pleocytosis but showed an elevated glucose of 106 and an elevated protein of 76 . the patient had an extensive workup for hypopituitarism . because addisonian crisis could not be initially ruled out , the patient was placed on distressed dose cortisone . however , a random cortisol level drawn initially in the emergency room subsequently returned as normal . the patient also responded appropriately to cortrosyn stimulation test . also , tsh was normal on admission . thyroid function panel drawn while the patient was on dopamine was subsequently abnormal . however , repeat panel was drawn when the patient was stable and had been transferred to the floor and was pending at the time of discharge . the patient was also evaluated by the neurology service for possible dysautonomia as the cause of her orthostatic hypotension with an inappropriate heart rate response to hypotension . emg showed no evidence of peripheral neuropathy . additional studies also included a head ct that showed a small lacunar infarct in the right pons and a partial empty sella which was confirmed by head mri . other studies sent during the workup included a negative serum and urine protein electrophoresis , negative serum and urine immunoglobulin electrophoresis . lh and ssh levels were consistent with a post-menopausal state . galactin levels were within normal limits . ana was negative . ace level was negative . heavy metal screen was negative except for a slightly elevated cobalt level so a possibility of a perineoplastic syndrome was considered . an anti-yo ri and who antibodies were sent and were pending at the time of discharge . on hospital day eight , the patient had uneventfully weaned off dopamine and was transferred to the floor . at that time , the stress dose hydrocortisone was weaned and the patient was switched to prednisone without any evidence of recurrent hypotension . her initial hyponatremia and hypokalemia resolved with stable sodium and potassium levels prior to discharge . in the studying of aggressive fluid resuscitation , it was felt that the patient had been sent into pulmonary edema . the patient auto-diuresed spontaneously . subsequent to the diuresis , reticulonodular diffuse pattern became apparent on chest x-ray . because of the patient 's significant smoking history , chest pt was performed to evaluate the possibility of lymphangitic carcinomatosis . however , the chest ct showed relative sparing of the lower lobes with primary involvement in both upper lobes . the patient following diuresis had no oxygen requirement whatsoever and had no respiratory complaints . prior to discharge , she was evaluated by the pulmonary service who felt that the differential diagnosis for her chest ct included eosinophilic granuloma , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , less likely sarcoidosis . because the patient had no respiratory symptoms , it was felt that her abnormal chest ct would be best evaluated as

flight to verg medical center . she arrived intubated and was hemodynamically stable despite concerns of a dissecting aortic arch aneurysm . she initially presented to brottlake medical center on 9/15/00 complaining of acute onset dysphasia to liquids and solids . while she was in brottlake medical center , she developed new onset stridor , and an ent consult was obtained . they attempted a fiberoptic intubation with a # 6 endotracheal tube and found a 5 mm severely compressed airway . she was also found to have a differential systolic blood pressure and ecchymosis on her anterior chest . given these findings , she underwent a ct scan which showed a retrotracheal mass that appeared to obliterate the esophagus . this raised concerns for a hemorrhage , and she was transferred to verg medical center emergently . at the ingree and ot of weamanshy medical center , she underwent an emergent ct scan with iv contrast . this revealed no extravasation of contrast and no aortic aneurysm . however , it did show an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with a density consistent with a hematoma . she was admitted to the thoracic surgery service under the care of dr. sccrookes . past medical history : severe hypertension , angina , gerd , peptic ulcer disease , status post billroth ii , ovarian cancer , status post tah-bso in 1987 with a negative second look laparotomy in 1988 , chronic anemia , chronic left ear infection . medications prior to admission : celexa 10 mg p.o. q.d.; lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.; capoten 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.; pepcid 20 mg p.o. q.d.; cardizem 180 mg p.o. q.d.; xanax 0.5 mg tabs . on transfer , she was on her preadmission medications plus unasyn and tigan 250 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. allergies : no known drug allergies . social history : she is divorced and retired . she lives with her daughter , and denies any tobacco or alcohol use . physical examination : the patient is intubated . vital signs : temperature 98.6 , 66 . right arm was 180/80 , left 188/72 , and a-line was 151/61 . tidal volume is 700 with a rate of 10 , 10 of pressure support , and 10 of peep , and 100% fio2 , satting 100% . general : she was sedated and spontaneously moving all four extremities . neck : edematous . trachea was midline . she had bilateral crepitus in the anterior neck . the superior clavicular area showed no signs of central line access attempts . she had a 3 cm mobile gelatinous well-circumscribed mass in the right supraclavicular region . her anterior neck and chest had a 1 cm to 2 cm area of ecchymosis . lungs : she had bilateral expiratory wheezes . abdomen : soft with good bowel sounds . it was nontender . it was obese with a large midline defect consistent with a ventral hernia , as well as a smaller anterior defect in the left lower quadrant . both were easily reducible . pulse : on the right side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , dp , pt , and radial ; on the left side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , dp , pt , and radial . laboratory data : cbc was 8.7 , 25.3 , and 184 . coags 12.2 , 24.8 , and 1.0 . her gas was 7.47/40/332 . electrolytes were 143 , 3.4 , 105 , 28 , 24 , 3 , and 131 . ekg showed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and incomplete left bundle branch block . ct scan showed an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with air . it was consistent with a hematoma . hospital course : ms. shuffa underwent an egd and flexible bronchoscopy on 9/16/00 shortly after she arrived . this showed tracheal compressions but no other lesions that were obvious at the time . she was hemodynamically stable and remained on the ventilator . the differential diagnoses at this point consisted of hematoma vs. neoplasm vs. an abscess vs. a thyroid tumor . on 9/22/00 , she underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy . a biopsy of this mass was consistent with hematoma . the operative report shows that there was an abnormal area below the trachea to the left which represented a cavity between the esophagus , trachea , aorta , and spine that was full of clot . there was no active bleeding at the time . over the next several days , the patient remained hemodynamically stable on the ventilator . she had an elevated calcium level that raised the suspicion that this mass could be a hematoma coming from a ruptured parathyroid adenoma . the ionized calcium was elevated as was the parathormone level . given these findings , she underwent a sestamibi scan . the sestamibi scan showed findings that were consistent with a parathyroid adenoma in the right lobe of the thyroid . at this time , it was believed that her clot was due to a rupture of this parathyroid adenoma . dr. ear brought the patient to the operating room on 10/5/00 . she underwent a parathyroid exploration with resection of a ruptured ectopic right upper parathyroid adenoma , a biopsy of a normal left and right lower parathyroids , resection of a left upper parathyroid , and tracheostomy . she tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the surgical intensive care unit with her new tracheostomy working well . her postoperative course was complicated by serosanguineous pleural effusion on the left . this required a chest tube . her hematocrit continued to drop over the next couple of days despite normal platelet count , normal coags , and no obvious source of bleeding . it was believed that she was continuing to bleed in her chest . however , we are not quite sure why this was occurring . she underwent an extensive workup by hematology that revealed a bleeding diatheses of unknown etiology . it turns out that several people in her family have a similar bleeding diathesis of unknown etiology . in conclusion , by systems : 1. neuro . the patient became intermittently agitated . we have been giving her haldol at bedtime as well as ativan p.r.n. throughout the day . she responds well to this . she speaks some english and seems to understand more than she speaks . she has a family member who is present for approximately 12 hours each day . she has been very helpful in translating and seems to say that ms. shuffa is in good spirits . 2. cardiac . the patient 's blood pressure has been ranging from approximately 140 to 160 systolic . this is on a current regimen of lopressor 25 mg per ng tube t.i.d. as well as diltiazem 60 mg per ng tube t.i.d. , and lisinopril 10 mg per ng tube q.d. she occasionally gets hypertensive when she is agitated . for this , we have given her 10 mg of hydralazine . her blood pressure responds well to this . otherwise , she is in normal sinus rhythm and has been hemodynamically stable throughout her hospitalization . the patient developed a left femoral artery pseudoaneurysm after placement of a greenfield filter . this has been followed by the vascular surgery service here at the ingree and ot of weamanshy medical center . dr. lenni lung has been consulted . the aneurysm at the time of discharge is approximately 2.5 cm . they elected not to inject it with thrombin . they asked that the patient follow-up with dr. ear in approximately three to four weeks so that this aneurysm can be assessed . they have opted for conservative management given the size . 3. respiratory . at the time of discharge , the patient remained on cpap with a peep of 7.5 and a pressure support of 9 . she seems to be tolerating this well as she has an o2 sat of 100% on 40% fio2 . her chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe hematoma that had greatly improved in the last few days . her right lung field is clear . her tracheostomy is functioning well , and we have had no problems with it . she will obviously need to be weaned as tolerated . we had her down to a low pressure support of 7 in the last week . with the pressure support at 7 , she became tachypneic and had to be brought back up to 10 . her oxygen saturation has always been good . 4. gi . the patient is getting tube feeds via her ng tube of full strength jevity of 75 cc per hour . this is her goal . she tolerates them very well and has approximately 200 cc to 300 cc of stool per day . last week , she had copious amounts of stool in the range of 500 cc to 1000 cc of liquid stool per day . stool cultures have been sent numerous times as well as analysis for c. difficile toxin . these have all been negative . we believe the this was an osmotic diarrhea . since her tube feeds have been changed from full strength nephro to jevity , her diarrhea has resolved . she has been taking zantac , and the ph of her ng tube residuals have been in the 5 to 8 range . 5. gu . the patient has had hypernatremia . she is approximately 10 kg up her overall body weight . we believe her to still be total body overloaded . over the last several days , we have been giving her approximately 500 cc to 1000 cc of free water through her ng tube . we also have been diuresing her with bumex . this seems to trend her sodium down . this will need to be monitored closely . her bun and creatinine have been normal , and she has always made good urine . 6. heme . as stated before , the patient continued to ooze into her pleural space well after her definitive operation . she had an extensive workup by hematology which revealed a bleeding diathesis of unknown origin . before we removed her chest tube , we had to give her platelets . she had no problems with this . at the time of discharge , her hematocrit is stable in the 28 to 33 range . i stress that she cannot be anticoagulated . we have given her lovenox in the past , and she continues to bleed . therefore , she is on no dvt prophylaxis . she does have a left iliac deep vein thrombosis . she has a greenfield filter in place , and this is her only dvt prophylaxis . 7. id . at the time of discharge , the patient has a urinary tract infection . she is growing enterobacter cloacae that is sensitive only to macrodantin from her urine cultures . interestingly enough , she also has enterobacter cloacae growing out of her sputum . this is also sensitive only to macrodantin . we do not believe that she has any respiratory process going on at the time . she is just begun on macrodantin at the day of discharge and should continue 100 mg per ng tube q.i.d. for a ten day course . her foley was changed the day before discharge . 8. tubes , lines , and drains . the patient has a tracheostomy , ng tube , and a foley catheter . her central line , which was left subclavian quad lumen , was removed on the day of discharge . discharge medications : albuterol nebulizers 2.5 mg q.4h. and atrovent nebulizers 0.5 mg
