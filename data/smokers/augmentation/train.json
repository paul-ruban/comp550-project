's . she subsequently had done well , although she had had chronic obstructive lung disease . she had been converted to normal sinus rhythm in 1977 , but in 1988 , the mitral valve on an echocardiogram was o.k. her ejection fraction was 81% , with no mitral regurgitation seen , with a peak gradient of 9 and a mean gradient of about 3 . in 1988 , she developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma , and has been followed by dr. times , as well as the pulmonologist down where she lives . she had been in and out of atrial flutter and fibrillation most of the time for the last few years . she , on one occasion , had sinus rhythm very briefly . dr. avejoh wierst at the pedines community hospital found her to be in congestive heart failure on two occasions over the last six weeks or so . a tee showed minimal mitral regurgitation and good left ventricular function . nevertheless , because of recurrent failure , it was felt that she should be transferred up to the bri health for further evaluation . hospital course : on examination here , i could hear no mitral regurgitation murmur . the observation in the hospital showed that she had recurrent runs of rapid atrial fibrillation as well as rapid supraventricular tachycardia going around 130 . this was on diltiazem and digoxin . at the same time , she had two 0.4 second pauses intermittently . because of this , the diltiazem was stopped , and she was further observed . we could not catheterize her right away because her prothrombin time was a little too high . over the weekend of observation , she continued to be in supraventricular tachycardia , but also developed a 4.4 second pause on digoxin alone , which was in low therapeutic range . she also had supraventricular tachycardia which was going up to 160 . therefore , a temporary pacemaker that put in on 5/4 , and diltiazem was restarted . a cardiac catheterization was carried out on 5/5 , once her prothrombin time had fully normalized . it showed that she had a large big right dominant coronary artery , which was free of any significant disease . the graft to the marginal artery was open , with good runoff into a large vessel . the left anterior descending had perhaps a mid-40% lesion only , with good left ventricular contraction and no mitral regurgitation seen on left ventricular angiogram . there was a very modest to moderate mitral valve gradient . the mitral valve area was calculated at 1.2 square centimeters , and then with modest exercise , the mitral valve area calculated to 1.7 square centimeters . thus , she had , at the most , modest mitral stenosis of no clinical significance . with this data in hand , it appeared that her previous congestive episodes was probably related to sustained periods of rapid heart action with minimal mitral stenosis . a permanent pacemaker was put in on 5/6/92 . this was an intermedex 292-03 pacemaker , set in the vvi mode with an escape rate of 65 . she tolerated the procedure well . on diltiazem , 60 , q.i.d. , she continued to have supraventricular tachycardia , running at around 130 , so we switched her over to verapamil , four times a day , along with digoxin , 0.125 , alternating with 0.25 , qd , which gave her a blood level of 1.0 . on this program , she is now beginning to ambulate with a heart rate of around 79-80 , and is starting to feel a lot better . we will ambulate her over the next couple of days . we have stopped her lasix , and we will be watching her daily weight , and that has been quite stable . if she remains stable over the next couple of days , she will be discharged on this program , to be followed jointly by dr. avejoh wierst and dr. em neighburce . em z. times , m.d. tr : enp / bmot dd : 5/9/92 td : 05/12/92 cc : for the patient , at dalee , alaska , for dr. avejoh wierst , c / o pedines community hospital , in stumphi road , biinss , south dakota 59762 ."}

5) plasmacytoma . 6) poor nutritional status . 7) thrombocytopenia status post bone marrow transplant . 8) multiple myeloma . history of present illness : this is a 59-year-old white male . the patient has had multiple myeloma since 1990 . he underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant in 10/92 at petersly hospital and medical center . at that time he received total body irradiation of 1400 cgy . this bone marrow transplant did not produce remission and then he was treated with three cycles of vad subsequently . in 08/94 , the patient developed lower back pain . a workup done in de is not available at the time of this dictation . according to her scanty records , an mri of the spine showed diffuse spinal column involvement with lesions in t4 and t8 with no cord compression at that time . he was then treated with radiation therapy from t3 to t9 receiving 2500 cgy from 08/94 to 09/94 . he has been on decadron since 08/94 . about two weeks prior to admission the patient developed mid back pain , burning in nature with radiation around the right lower ribs . he also began to develop noticeably increasing bilateral lower extremity weakness and possibly numbness in the lower extremities . he stated that he had difficulty rising from a chair . an mri without gadolinium done on 11/20/94 of the spine showed a right posterior lateral epidural mass extending from t9 to t12 . there was evidence of cord compression . the patient 's decadron dose was increased to 12 mg q day and he was also started on ms contin and radiation therapy was being planned and arranged at the petersly hospital and medical center . however , one day prior to admission the patient developed right lower extremity pain and could not walk secondary to the pain . over the next 12 hours while in transit to the hospital , the patient 's right lower extremity became red , swollen , and increasingly painful . he has had chronic bilateral lower extremity swelling since his transplant but the right lower extremity swelling was noticeably increased . he also complained of some fecal incontinence the day prior to admission without urinary incontinence . at the time of presentation the patient denied headache , arm weakness , changes in vision , dysarthria , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , chest pain or shortness of breath . he was taken to huyychestleme health of in scoo , utah where he had a temperature of 99.9 , blood pressure 90/50 , heart rate 128 , and o2 sat of 91% on room air . blood cultures , urine culture , and ua were all done . blood cultures drawn on admission subsequently grew pseudomonas aeruginosa . he was treated with ceftazidime , gentamicin , and vancomycin and also was started on a dopamine drip for treatment of his sepsis . a swan was placed and initial readings were cvp of 6 , wedge pressure of 10 to 12 , cardiac index of 4.7 , and svr of 438 all consistent with a pseudomonas sepsis picture . he was given stress steroids and was subsequently transferred to lorough medical center 's intensive care unit for further management . past medical history : 1) multiple myeloma . 2) paroxysmal atrial fibrillation . 3) plasmacytoma of t9 through t12 . 4) chronic renal insufficiency . 5) chronically low platelet count . 6) failed autologous bone marrow transplant in 10/92 . 7) hypothyroidism . family history : positive for diabetes

gentamicin , solu cortef 100 mg q8h , lasix , synthroid , insulin , ms contin 60 mg b.i.d. , mso4 2 mg p.r.n. pain iv , dopamine 12 mcg per minute . physical examination : on admission showed a non-toxic appearing male with temperature 99.5 , blood pressure 82/50 , heart rate 118 , respiratory rate 15 . heent exam atraumatic , no oral lesions . neck supple , carotids without bruits . cardiac exam was regular s1 and s2 , no murmur . chest clear to auscultation with a few fine crackles at the left base . abdomen non-distended , positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender , no hepatosplenomegaly or masses . rectal normal tone , guaiac positive brown stool , no perirectal lesions or erythema . extremities reveal the right lower extremity was tense , purple-red , swollen , and was warm from the knee to the ankle and extremely tender . there was pitting edema of both lower extremities but no evidence of cellulitis of the left lower extremity . neurological exam on admission revealed he was drowsy but easily arousable to voice , oriented to person , retelk county medical center , and date , able to say no but mildly inattentive during examination . cranial nerves intact . motor exam normal tone , positive asterixis , no drift . strength was decreased in both lower extremities . coordination was normal with good finger to nose , gait was not tested . deep tendon reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities , 1+ in the patella reflexes , no reflexes at the ankles , upgoing babinski toes bilaterally . laboratory data : on admission revealed white blood cell count 4.2 , hct 27 , platelet count 28 . glucose 191 . pt 17.6 , ptt 48.7 , fibrinogen 686 , tt 39.2 . magnesium 1.7 . ua showed no white blood cells , positive granular casts . chest x-ray was without infiltrates , wand in good position . an mri was performed upon admission and showed an epidural mass at the right posterior lateral t9 to t12 area invading the neural foramina . there was no csf density . these findings were consistent with the cord compression . hospital course : by problems - 1) infectious disease / cellulitis : the patient 's clinical situation was most consistent with a pseudomonas cellulitis and subsequent sepsis . blood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out pseudomonas that was sensitive to imipenem and tobramycin . there were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at retelk county medical center and those also grew out pseudomonas aeruginosa . the organism grown at this institution was sensitive to imipenem , ceftazidime , amikacin , gentamicin , ciprofloxacin , tobramycin but was resistant to cefotetan , ceftriaxone , mezlocillin , bactrim , ampicillin , chloramphenicol , and sulbactam . he was treated initially with ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism 's susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital . he was subsequently switched to imipenem and tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course . the tobramycin and imipenem were started on 11/25/94 . in addition , the patient received a five day course of intravenous igg to improve infection control . vancomycin was also added to his regimen on 11/28/94 and this was primarily to provide improved mrsa coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral right lower extremity . he was evaluated by the surgery department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time . he is being maintained with twice daily xeroform with betadine changes . these dressing changes are applied by applying the xeroform on betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages . of note , the patient has extreme pain with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for pain control during dressing changes . the plan is to complete a full course of imipenem and tobramycin for his pseudomonas cellulitis . as mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh . the cause of this erythema is not know at this time but has not shown extensive progression . 2) cardiovascular : the patient was initially treated with dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved . he was noted to be in rapid af on several episodes receiving 5 mg iv lopressor each time with improvement . he has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm . an echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital while he was septic showed decreased global ef . the patient is being maintained on digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation . he has had no significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization . the plan is to continue the digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection fraction when he is clinically better . 3) oncology : the patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine . he has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay . the plan is to complete a full course of xrt to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma . the patient 's lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied , however , the mri appearance does not seem to be infectious and is most consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy . 4) neurologic : as mentioned above he has a cord compression and is on steroids . he was initially treated with iv decadron 10 mg up front and then 6 mg q6h. his neurological exam remained stable with no evidence of increasing lower extremity edema . his decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg iv q6h on 12/3/94 . his decadron dose will be slowly titrated down over time following his neurological exam closely . 5) blood sugars : the patient has steroid induced diabetes mellitus . he has been on increasing doses of insulin receiving nph in the morning and night in addition to a czi sliding scale on a q6h basis . the plan is to continue the supplemental insulin while he is on steroids and while his sugars remain high . 6) respiratory : he initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90% . however , with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his o2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93% . he can be given intravenous lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema . 7) nutrition : the patient has a poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia . he has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued . he should also be encouraged to eat as much as possible orally in addition to this tube feeds and aspiration precaution should be maintained . 8) elevated pt and ptt : both of these responded to three day course of vitamin k 10 mg each day . his pt and ptt are now normal , however , he continues to run a low platelet count . this has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant . we have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20,000 to reduce his bleeding risk . he also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his hct around 30 . thrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient . disposition : discharge medications : tylenol 650 mg po q4h p.r.n. , dulcolax 10 mg per rectum b.i.d. p.r.n. , decadron 5 mg iv q6h , digoxin 0.25 mg po q day , colace 100 mg po t.i.d. , florinef 0.1 mg po q day

long standing history of significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis . he was recently hospitalized at the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital for repeat cardiac catheterization . after a comprehensive assessment , drs. sieh and shufffyfe did not recommend operative repair of severe mitral regurgitation or aortic stenosis . he was thus discharged with plans for continued medical therapy of his coronary artery disease . unfortunately , the patient continued to deteriorate and was readmitted for an attempt at hemodynamic tailoring and possible inotropic support . past medical history : is notable for above . for long standing dilated cardiomyopathy , severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 by previous catheterization . the patient had limited coronary artery disease with an occluded right coronary artery collateralized from the left system . physical examination : the patient was a well appearing pleasant man who was dyspneic on the examining table . initial blood pressure was 95/65 , heart rate 80 and regular . respiratory rate was 14 . jugular venous pressure was 7 with modest hepatojugular reflex . the carotids were 2+ and the lungs were notable for diminished breath sounds with inspiratory rhonchi . the point of maximum impulse was displaced and the first and second heart sounds were unremarkable with a 2/6 murmur of mitral regurgitation . there was no s3 gallop . abdomen was soft and non-tender and the rest of the examination was notable only for a slightly diminished pulses and poor perfusion . laboratory data : notable for a sodium of 144 , potassium 3.7 , bun 43 , creatinine 1.8 , albumin 3.0 , hematocrit 36 , white count 9.5 , platelet count 254 and a negative urinalysis . a chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with modest edema and the electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation , previous inferior apical infarct and right bundle branch block . hospital course and treatment : the patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent right heart catheterization which revealed a right atrial pressure of 11 , pulmonary artery pressure of 55/25 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 26 and a cardiac output of 2.7 liters per minute . the pa line was kept in place while the patient was admitted to the coronary care unit where he underwent an attempt at hemodynamic tailoring . initially nipride was begun with some augmentation of the cardiac index but eventually a fall of the cardiac index to 1.8 . the patient was then begun on milrinone to a dose of .4 mcg. per kg. per minute with improvement in his cardiac index to approximately 2.0 and a corresponding fall in his filling pressures . because of the increased ectopy that appeared to be temporally associated with this infusion , the patient was switched to dobutamine and titrated to a dose of 250 mcg. per minute . on dobutamine the cardiac index was 2.4-2.7 and at the end of his hemodynamic tailoring which included vigorous diuresis and the addition of isordil and captopril back to his chronic medical program , the patient 's right atrial pressure was 6 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 9 and the cardiac index was 2.7 . systemic vascular resistance was 900 . the patient was then decannulated

however , no ischemia was seen . an echocardiogram was done . the echocardiogram showed terrible left ventricular function , with left ventricular aneurysm . the right ventricle appeared to be acceptable . the percutaneous drainage catheter continued to have high output . the fluid was sent for amylase , which came back 53,230 . on 4/28/95 , the patient had new onset of abdominal pain . his white count had bumped from 8.3 on admission to 18.5 , on 4/27 . a computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed . approximately 100 cc.'s of thick brownish material was aspirated through the indwelling catheter . the computerized tomography scan showed the catheter tip in good position . because of the patient 's deteriorating state , the patient was brought to the operating room on 4/28/95 . an exploratory laparotomy was performed . the splenic flexure had a purulent exudative process along the antimesenteric surface . thus , the splenic flexure and a portion of the descending colon were resected . the patient underwent a left colectomy with end transverse colostomy , and oversewing of the descending colon . drainage of the pancreatic necrosis was also done . the patient tolerated the procedure fairly well , and was transferred to the intensive care unit . in the intensive care unit , the patient had a prolonged course . the patient was then extubated on postoperative day #2 , but remained pressor-dependent . he remained on imipenem , and vancomycin was also started . thereafter , the patient had a long and complicated postoperative course . he was eventually transferred to the floor , where he remained meta-stable . he had repeated episodes of hypotension to 80-90 systolic/40-50 diastolic . these resolved without incident . he also had repeated temperature spikes . after repeated work ups , it was felt that these were probably due to remaining infection in the peripancreatic area . his drainage tube from the peripancreatic area was gradually advanced , and eventually discontinued . mr. mass was placed on multiple courses of antibiotics . most recently , he was on a 28 day course of vancomycin , ofloxacin , and flagyl , for blood cultures that were positive for gram positive cocci and enteric and non-enteric gram negative rods . this 28 day course was completed on 07/15/95 . the patient was also treated initially with amphotericin-b and then with fluconazole for a computerized tomography guided aspirate of a small fluid collection around his pancreas , which grew candida albicans . the patient also had several episodes of fungal cystitis with torulopsis glabrata , going from his urine . he was treated with amphotericin-b bladder washes for this . mr. mass was initially anticoagulated for his left ventricular aneurysm . he remained stable from a cardiac fashion . he did have problems with po intake . he had repeated bouts of small-volume emesis that may have been secondary to reflux . he was treated with a variety of anti-emetics , most recently granisetron , with only mild success . he remained total parenteral nutrition-dependent throughout his hospital course . by the end of june , it became clear that mr. mass would require aggressive surgical intervention in order to eradicate his intra-abdominal bursts of intermittent sepsis ; however , long discussions with the patient and his wife , who was his health-care proxy , revealed that they felt that no further aggressive intervention be attempted . the patient had been made a do not resuscitate do not intubate patient earlier in his hospital stay . multiple discussions were held between dr. mass , the rest of the surgical team , and the patient 's wife , with this same result . after discussion with the patient 's primary doctor , dr. douet at vassdiysey medical center , it was felt that the patient and his family would be best served if the patient were transferred to vassdiysey medical center . of note , given the patient 's do not resuscitate status and the risk for bleeding , the patient 's coumadin was stopped without incident several weeks before transfer . doctors discharge instructions : medications : 1. heparin , 5,000 units , sc. , b.i.d. 2. lisinopril , 20 mg. , po , qd . 3. isordil , 10 mg. , po , t.i.d. 4. nitropaste , 1 inch to chest wall , q8h. 5. carafate , one gram , po or per nasogastric tube , q.i.d. , cardizem , 30 mg. , po , q6h , digoxin , 0.25 mg. , po or intravenously , qd , fluconazole , 200 mg. , qd , for five more days , after transfer , for a total of a 14 day course , total parenteral nutrition to meet the patient 's nutritional needs . the patient has an ostomy appliance around the former site of his pancreatic fistula drain . this area has continued to drain and it is felt that it could be best managed by an ostomy appliance and stoma care . the patient is also treated with shots of morphine for intermittent pain . i drain , m.d. dictating for : liasun l. mass , m.d. tr : aet / bmot dd : 07/16/95 td : 07/15/95 cc : stat discharge summary . copies to dr. liasun mass , dr. tomedankell new of cardiology , and dr. scosthuang of vassdiysey medical center . please have a copy in the chart ;

then , dr. thorebreutz took him to the operating room , where he had quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting . he had a left internal mammary artery graft of the lad , a single saphenous vein to the right coronary artery with 280 cc per minute flow , and a saphenous vein snake graft to the diagonal and circumflex with 150 cc per minute flow . a paraphimosis was noted and treated by dr. ryna jescdrig . after surgery he had a ongoing sinus tachycardia . he was able to be rapidly weaned and extubated . he had good hemodynamics . he had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats . his intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the surgical intensive care unit . he was seen in consultation by the nutrition service , who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus . on 08/05 it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous heparin and indeed , when heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal . therefore , he does have a thrombocytopenic reaction to heparin . he remained in normal sinus rhythm . he did have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , which were clinically stable . he had a right bundle branch block . he is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction , but he is clinically stable on ace inhibitors , digoxin , coumadin , and aspirin . therefore he was able to be discharged home . he understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin times and his arrhythmias ;

with proximal distraction . a lucency and irregularity of the glenoid , possibly representing a fracture , was also seen , and a ct scan was therefore obtained in order to evaluate this area . this ct scan , done also on 10/10/97 , again showed the severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus . two major fracture fragments were seen at the humeral head , articulating with the glenoid fossa . the fracture fragments retained their proper site of articulation with the glenoid fossa . innumerable smaller fracture fragments were interposed between the fracture fragment and the distal

and avf with probable old inferior myocardial infarction . t - waves were also noted to be inverted in i and avl . ventricular bigeminy was also seen . hospital course and treatment : 1. orthopedics : the patient has a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus . he is status post a hemiarthroplasty on 10/17/97 . he received ancef preoperatively . physical therapy has been seeing the patient and putting him through passive external rotation to the neutral position of the left shoulder and forward flexion with physical therapy assistance . brittle bones were noted during the operation . a bone density scan would be recommended as an outpatient , in order to evaluate this . 2. neurological : the patient has right facial droop , right ptosis , stable and present for greater than one year . 3. cardiovascular : no chest pain , no shortness of breath , 1+ ankle edema . the patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction , given his fall at the airport and bigeminy seen on electrocardiogram that he developed during conscious sedation during reduction of the fracture . cardiology was consulted and aspirin and beta blocker added to his regimen , as well as chest wall nitroglycerin around the time of surgery , which was subsequently discontinued . an adenosine sestamibi was performed on 10/12/97 , which showed a negative electrocardiogram for ischemia and cardiac perfusion scans , with a moderate-sized , dense , fixed inferior defect indicative of scar . a small / moderate-sized , mild-intensity , reversible posterior lateral defect was also seen , indicative of mild / moderate ischemia . an echocardiogram was performed on columbus day which showed an ejection fraction of 50% , left atrial enlargement , thickening of the aortic wall consistent with atherosclerotic changes , left ventricle size , and systolic function within normal limits . cardiac monitor was placed on the patient , given the bigeminy , and he did rule out for myocardial infarction . cardiology recommended that in addition to the medications already stated above , his hematocrit be kept greater than 30 . after his procedure on 10/17/97 , elevated cpks were noted on 10/19/97 to 10/20/97 , and the first level was 744 , cpk # 2 635 , and cpk # 3 461 . mb fractionations of the cpks were all negative and were thought to be secondary to the patient 's beginning physical therapy on 10/19/97 , and all muscular in origin . 4. gastroenterology : gi was consulted on 10/15/97 for melena , decreased hematocrit prior to his humeral fixation surgery . upper endoscopy x 2 were done . the first was on 10/15/97 , which showed clotted blood in the esophagus . the stomach had evidence of prior surgery and old blood in the stomach . it was thought that the blood in the esophagus was secondary to a possible mallory-weiss tear . a second endoscopy was also performed several days later , in order to rule out a gastric ulcer , and also because the patient had had another episode of melena . a gastric ulcer was found and this was biopsied and pathology is pending at this time . this report needs to be followed up , and will be available at bri health in the pathology department some time within the next three to seven days . the patient also needs a repeat endoscopy and a gi follow-up appointment inapproximately two months . i have spoken with the patient in detail , and he will be getting in touch with his primary-care physician , dr. fordwoodall stick , in ranegei pkwy , verertliet , south carolina 62156 . the patient is to arrange follow up with a gi doctor in jotar boulevard , cunahtampfordama , south dakota 62848 through his primary-care physician . the patient was initially on cimetidine and carafate here at bri health , and then switched to prilosec 20 mg bid . 5. pulmonary : the patient 's admitting chest x-ray showed an elevated left hemidiaphragm consistent with atelectasis versus splinting on that side . incentive spirometry was started . albuterol and atrovent nebulizers were done . the patient received chest physical therapy bid . 6. endocrine : the patient needs still better diabetes control . he has been somewhat noncompliant with his diet ( eating pringle 's in the room ) . his nph was recently increased today ( 10/23/97 ) to 24 units in the a.m. and 14 units in the p.m. with czi sliding-scale coverage . 7. infectious disease : the patient urinalysis on 10/19/97 showed moderate occult blood , ph 5 , albumin 1+ , white blood cells present , 2-50 red blood cell , 10-20 white blood cells , few bacteria , and moderate bladder epithelial cells . floxin 200 mg po bid was begun . however , his urine culture from the same day remained negative , and this was discontinued two days later . a repeat urinalysis on 10/22/97 was negative . 8. renal : after the patient 's procedure , he was felt to be volume overloaded . he was given lasix 40 mg iv x 1 and also had nitro paste around the time of his surgery and beta blocker . the patient became slightly hypotensive on the night of 10/18/97 with systolic blood pressures in the 80s to 90s. his bun/ creatinine rose from 16/1.2 on 10/18/97 to 25/1.9 on 10/18/97 to 22/9.1 to today 's labs , which are 15/0.7 on 10/23/97 . 9. hematology : the patient transfused 2 units on 10/15/97 for a hematocrit of 27.6 . the patient transfused 2 units of 10/16/97 for a hematocrit of 30.03 . the patient transfused 1 unit on 10/18/97 for a hematocrit of 29.4 . the patient transfused 1 unit on 10/19/97 for a hematocrit of 27.9 . the patient transfused 2 units on 10/20/97 for a hematocrit of 28.2.10 . fen : repleting potassium , magnesium , phosphorus as needed . the patient was noted to be slightly hyponatremic over the past few days , with sodiums

cmv . a repeat cat scan of the sinuses with finding of progressive thickening of the left maxillary sinus and both sets of ethmoid air cells since prior study of november 9 , indicating progressive infection of acanthamoeba and any possible superinfection with bacterial sinusitis . in the days following admission , there was clear evidence for progression of erythematous nodules over both arms and right thigh at foci of acanthamoeba infection , suggesting progressive skin involvement with acanthamoeba . infectious disease consult was obtained and recommendation was to switch from voriconazole to itraconazole , on which there was more existing data on treatment of acanthamoeba infection . pentamidine intravenous and nasal washings were continued . clinical progression of skin and sinus infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy continued , with emergence on november 20 of a new right-sided ptosis in association with a left homonymous hemianopsia , and fleeting confusion while febrile , prompting head mri which revealed a large 5 x 2 x 4.3 cm region in the right occipital lobe of hemorrhage and edema , with dural and , likely , leptomeningeal enhancement in association with small foci in the right cerebellum and pons , concerning for early lesions of similar type . idiosyncratic reaction to cyclosporine was considered as cause for cerebritis , and cyclosporine was discontinued . however , much more likely explanation is progressive infection of acanthamoeba with new neurologic involvement . most likely source of fevers was judged to be progressive acanthamoeba infection , even on maximal antimicrobial therapy . a single blood culture positive for coagulase negative staphylococcus was treated with a course of vancomycin in the setting of a picc line and a chest x-ray on november 20 indicating possible developing pneumonia , resulted in a course of levofloxacin , for both possible pneumonia , as well as treatment of any bacterial superinfection of acanthamoeba sinusitis . patient experienced steady decline , with persistent fevers despite all above measures , progressive areas of skin infection , more frequent episodes of confusion , and decreasing oxygen saturation in the setting of bilateral effusion , in the setting of fluid surge spacing . on november 30 , a family meeting with patient 's daughter and spouse , along with primary oncologist , dr. tomedankell bile , attending physician , dr. mellerny close , and house staff , was held to discuss patient 's critical condition and inability to prevent progression of skin , sinus and neurological acanthamoeba infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy . decision was made to withdraw aggressive measures of care , with priority on patient 's comfort . pentamidine , itraconazole , levaquin , acyclovir and gcsf were discontinued , along with other medications nonessential to patient 's comfort . dnr / dni status initially established early during hospital stay remained in effect . the patient was made comfortable with morphine for pain and for air hunger , and sinus suctioning was continued to relieve congestion , in conjunction with continuation of nasal sprays . tylenol was continued to control fevers and prednisone was continued to control inflammation and prevent precipitation of adrenal insufficiency . such measures have been continued through december 3 , and patient remains comfortable through this time . this interim dictation to be followed by an addendum detailing end of hospital course . dictated by : shaa kacholera

overnight with a combination of propafol and fentanyl . this was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean . she continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's . she also fell into a coma once again . on march 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes . on april 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation . discussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery . she had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of jose pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones . decision was made in conjunction with the family and dr. caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support . the patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a t-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics . her respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on april 2 , 1994 . disposition / plan on

amiodarone 200 mg. y . coumadin as adjusted by prothrombin times . digoxin 0.125 mg. y . multivitamin one tablet daily and albuterol nebulizers qid . history of present illness : the patient is a 69 year old woman from maine without prior history of overt cardiac disease . she does have a history of peripheral edema on dyazide . she has been a smoker and presented on the day of admission with dizziness . she was in her usual state of health until two to three days prior to admission when she noted intermittent dizziness and felt weak . she denied chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea or vomiting . on the morning of admission to the haold memorial hospital she went out to feed some birds and then felt weak , came back , was dizzy and was somewhat diaphoretic . her sister with whom she lives insisted that she seek medical care and she was brought to the haold memorial hospital emergency room and was found to have a pulse of 61 and blood pressure of 91/45 . the electrocardiogram done there showed evidence of an inferior wall infarction with st segment elevations in leads 2 , 3 and avf and st depressions in leads v1 through v4 and avl . right sided leads did not provide evidence of a right ventricular infarction . she was given streptokinase , aspirin , dopamine for hypotension and atropine with external zoll pacemaker after bradycardia into the 30 's developed . the blood sugar was elevated at 208 . the bun was 24 and creatinine 1.7 . the uric acid 11.2 and initial ck was 35 . when she developed wide complex tachycardia she was given a lidocaine bolus and brought to the fih by helicopter . in the emergency room she appeared hemodynamically stable initially and the dopamine was weaned off . the electrocardiogram taken here showed the st segment elevations had diminished considerably but there were continued reciprocal changes in the anterior leads . she had a few beats of wide complex tachycardia . her only medication was dyazide . physical examination : she was a pleasant rather vague obese woman in no acute distress . the pulse was 68 to 80 and the blood pressure 95/52 . the respirations 18 and she was afebrile . the jugular veins were not distended . the carotids were full . there were no bruits . the chest was clear with distant breath sounds . the cardiac rhythm was regular with frequent premature beats and no murmur . there were no rubs . the abdomen was obese without palpable organs or masses . there was no peripheral edema . there were good dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally . there was decreased vibratory sense on neurological examination but there was no asterixis . her electrolytes were normal with a bun of 24 and creatinine 1.9 . the cholesterol was 171 . triglycerides 103 . by this time her ck was 600 . her hematocrit was 37.1 . hemoglobin 12.8 and white blood count 7800 . the pt was 19.3 and ptt 34.8 . review of the electrocardiograms from haold memorial hospital demonstrated atrial flutter with variable conduction . she was in sinus tachycardia here with right bundle branch block and continued st segment elevation with qs in 3 and avf . she was admitted to the coronary care unit where she continued to have intermittent marked bradycardia with junctional rhythm and relatively low blood pressures and runs of flow ventricular tachycardia . she became increasingly disoriented . she developed first degree av block and then wenckebach block . the chest films showed mild cephalization . she became very drowsy with sedation when she developed some agitation and required intubation . she went to the cardiac catheterization laboratory because of low cardiac output and shock . she had ventricular pacing and the cardiac output came up to 2.3 . catheter study then revealed right coronary occlusion with no significant left sided disease . the right coronary artery had a large burden of intravascular thrombus and she was eventually able to have the clot cleared and a near 2.5 stent was placed with good result . she had timi 2 to 3 flow in the right coronary artery after stenting and removal of clot from the right coronary artery . she continued to have intermittent runs of ventricular tachycardia . she remained intubated but her hemodynamics improved somewhat . dobutamine was diminished because of the wide complex tachycardia and she developed atrial fibrillation . she was initially tried on intravenous pronestyl in an attempt to restore sinus rhythm . she was later switched to amiodarone but there continued to be no effect on her atrial fibrillation . eventually her lines were able to be withdrawn and she was moved to the floor . she had a lot of wheezing and in late january she had continued elevated wedge pressure and her creatinine started to rise to 3.2 and then 4 with nonoliguric renal failure . she was then returned to the unit where she underwent further monitoring . the bun rose to 91 . her digoxin level was 1.9 on february 6 . she was able eventually to be extubated and moved back to the floor . efforts to mobilize her began in early january and an echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 49% . the right ventricular function was normal . after extubation she developed a considerable amount of upper respiratory stridor which was treated initially with decadron . the patient was seen in consultation by ent consultants who found that she had some hardened inspissated secretions in the region of the vocal cords , glottic inlet and subglottis . there was no structural abnormality . moistened oxygen and mucomyst was given with eventual restoration of her voice and diminution in her stridor . she continued a rather slow improvement . the patient was seen in consultation by drs. morning and morning because of the abnormalities of renal function . the possibility of renal artery stenosis was raised and she eventually was able to have a mri . she had some hematuria and was seen by dr. ryna jescdrig . renal and bladder ultrasounds were normal . she had abnormal urinary cytology however and dr. jescdrig strongly recommended that this be followed up by cystoscopy when she is able to do that . that can take place either here at his office or in aersing rocuch sun or when she returns to carfachemoses hospital . because of alternating and fluctuating mental status , she had a head ct scan which showed small area of intracranial bleeding . this was followed up and was shown to resolve . mr angiogram revealed no evidence of renal artery stenosis . a mri of the head because of the small area of bleeding was done to look for amyloid angiopathy which would have made anticoagulation dangerous . she was then begun on coumadin when none was found and is now being transferred to rehabilitation in hopes of her eventual return to her home with her sister on carfachemoses hospital . shasqualena r. im , m.d. tr : wqf dd : 02/21/1998 td : 02/22/1998 8:41 a cc : shasqualena roseke im , m.d. stat"}

had an episode of hematemesis x 1 . he discussed this with his friend at sloan-caer/viewbonse memorial hospital but did not seek medical attention , hoping it would go away . on the morning of admission , mr. kote awoke from sleep and immediately vomited a large quantity of blood . he said it was large in quantity . he had associated right upper quadrant pain and shortly thereafter passed a large black stool . paramedics were called and found him to have a blood pressure of 120/80 , a pulse of 92 , breathing at 16 and normally cognizant . during transport to the tecal galecounxopt community hospital emergency room , he vomited an additional 200 cc. of dark , red blood . in the emergency department , an ng-tube was placed and additional dark blood was suctioned . he subsequently was lavaged to clear but had a repeat of hematemesis prompting urgent endoscopy . on endoscopy , he was found to have grade iii varices without active bleeding in the lower one-third of the esophagus

silhouette , no opacities and no evidence of pulmonary edema . his ekg had normal axis , normal intervals , no lvh or rvh , tiny q 's in v3 through v6 , no t wave inversions or other indications of acute ischemia . hospital course and treatment : our impression was this was a 73 year old man with cirrhosis , portal hypertension , hepatocellular carcinoma , hepatitis c , history of alcoholism in the past , history of peptic ulcer disease on aspirin without acid blockade who presented with an upper gi bleed with multiple esophageal and gastric varices . his portal hypertension resulting in a ruptured varices was almost certainly his cause of bleed . there was no evidence of ulcers on endoscopy . his bleed also might have been precipitated by med non-compliance versus other causes of increased blood pressure such as increased salt intake . the temporal proximity to paracentesis was initially worrisome for an underlying infection without precipitating hemodynamic imbalance , although no evidence of infection was established with any sputum , paracentesis culture or blood culture . given the extent of hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis of cancer , the risk of worsening obstruction to portal venous flow versus ____________ was also increased . he was admitted to the medical intensive care unit while his initial care that first night was , by system : neurologically , given the risk of hepatic encephalopathy with the recent gi bleed , he was put on lactulose 30 cc. po titrated to 4 loose stools per day . cardiovascularly , he was hypertensive by report on admission and tng drip , lasix , aldactone and propranolol was instigated to keep his systolic blood pressure between 100 and 120 . rhythm wise , he was in normal sinus rhythm , no issues . his pr interval was watched as propranolol was started . there was no evidence of ischemia . pulmonary wise , he had some wheezing on exam . he was treated with inhalers . there was a suggestion of pneumonia on exam , but not on chest x-ray . gi wise , he underwent status post banding x 5 for bleeding esophageal varices . he was kept npo . he was started originally on propranolol and then switched to metoprolol as he experienced some wheezing in order to decrease his portal pressure . he was also started on triatide , omeprazole . in terms of hem wise , he had experienced an approximately 12 point crit drop with this bleed . for this , he was given 6 units of ffp , 4 units of packed red blood cells and platelets were kept greater than 60 with transfusion of platelets . he was also given vitamin k 10 mg. po x 3 days . he was treated with pneumoboots for dvt prophylaxis . he was kept in the medical intensive care unit for 24 hours during which time , his hematocrit remained stable and he had no other signs of continued gi bleed . at that point , he was transferred to carespistown hospital for further management . on his second day of admission , there was a concern about a developing pneumonia based on a worsening lung exam and also worsening cough , although sputum and all blood cultures remained negative for pathogens and the patient did not have a temperature spike . despite this , he was started on levoflox 250 mg. po qd on march 18th as well as flagyl 500 mg. iv tid for the possibility of an emerging aspiration pneumonia . the major therapeutic concern on the floor was diuresis . his aldactone was gradually titrated up to a maximum dose of 400 mg. per day divided in three even doses . in addition , lasix was added on to help him with diuresis . between march 20th and march 25th , he lost approximately 7 pounds on this regimen . however , after lasix was added back on , his creatinine rose from approximately 1.4 up to 1.7 and lasix was held for 24 hours . at that time , a dose of 20 mg. iv bid was re-instigated . on the 400 mg. of aldactone , his potassium remained in the high normal range around 5.0 . therefore , on march 25th , his aldactone was decreased to 100 mg. po tid and lasix was kept at 20 mg. bid . on this regimen , his weight remained approximately stable . he was also kept on a low salt diet . he was also kept on a 2 liter per day fluid restriction . by march 26 , 1998 , he was ready to discharged back to ant sonroeinland medical center , although he would stay in the medical unit there before returning back to his own room . at discharge , the active issues still to be dealt with at ant sonroeinland medical center are : 1. necessity of daily electrolytes and creatinine monitoring as his diuretic regimen was optimized . at discharge , he was on 100 mg. aldactone tid and 20 mg. of lasix bid but with potassium running in the high normal range necessitating daily electrolyte checks while the exact ratio of lasix to aldactone was optimized . 2. he also needs daily weight checks and daily abdominal exam to evaluate his fluid status . 3. he also needs tid fingerstick glucose to monitor his blood sugar . 4. in terms of his antibiotics , he has 4 days left of his flagyl 500 mg. q8hours . for sbp prophylaxis , he should be left indefinitely on levoflox 250 mg. po qd . 5. he should be enforced on a no concentrated sugars , low salt diet . 6. he also should have a 2 liter fluid restriction , if possible . 7. he should have initially twice a week checks of his hematocrit to make sure that his gi bleeding has stabilized . follow up : 1. he will follow up with his primary care physician , dr. portal , at ant sonroeinland medical center . doctor portal has been notified of the patient 's progress at tecal galecounxopt community hospital . 2. from our gi service , the patient will follow up with dr. shufftakeaakote and follow up will be arranged in gi clinic for next week . medications on discharge : 1. prilosec 20 mg. po bid . 2. zinc sulfate 220 mg. po qd . 3. isordil 10 mg. po tid . 4. lopressor 12.5 mg. po bid . 5. levoflox 250 mg. po qd . 6. atrovent nebs q8hours . 7. flagyl 500 mg. iv tid to stop on 3/31/1998 . 8. albuterol q4hour nebulizer treatments . 9. lactulose 30 cc. po bid . 10. aldactone 100 mg. po tid titrated to potassium . 11. lasix 20 mg. po bid . 12. nph insulin 14 units subq in the morning , 10 units subq in the evening as well as additional czi insulin based on tid fingersticks . addendum : unfortunately patient could not be discharged on 3/28/98 because , in the context of starting his lasix , his creatinine bumped overnight from 1.7 to 2.2 , possibly because of a progression of his hepatorenal syndrome . his potassium also climbed to 5.1 . because of this , we held all of his diuretics , namely his lasix and aldactone . despite holding his aldactone , his potassium continued to rise over the course of the next two days . it went as high as 5.8 on 3/29/98 . he was treated with kayexalate b.i.d. 30 gm. as treatment for this . by 3/31/98 his potassium had gone down to 4.0 . we then restarted a much smaller dose of aldactoneat 50 mg. po q day . this was the dose of aldactone he had originally been admitted with . on 3/31/98 the junior resident on drugway hospital , dr. asaleysean portal , had an extensive conversation with the patient about his future medical care . patient was very clear that he did not want any extraordinary measures done in case of acute illness . specifically he did not want to be intubated or have any of the acls protocol in the case of acardiac or pulmonary arrest . he also was very adamant that if he was to rapidly gi bleed , as from an esophageal bleed , that he did not want any extraordinary measures taken . specifically he did not want to be re-banded . we also addressed the possibility of having the gi service re-endoscope him in a few weeks to look at the progression of his esophageal banding . he said that he did not feel that that made any sense given his other comorbid disease . the patient was very adamant that in the future he would prefer to stay at the southnyra erwillte cinee memorial hospital where he is in residence . dr. asaleysean portal spoke with dr. fat of the ant sonroeinland medical center about this and that residence will make it clear that patient is not to be transferred back to an acute care facility in the case of decompensation . medications on discharge : lactulose 30 cc 's po b.i.d. , prilosec 20 mg. po b.i.d. , zinc sulfate 220 mg. po q day , isordil 10 mg. po t.i.d. , metoprolol 12.5 mg. po b.i.d. , levofloxacin 250 mg. po q day , atrovent nebs q8 hours , albuterol nebs q8 hours , and flagyl 500 mg. iv q8 hours with the last day 4/1/98 . patient will need no further antibiotics in his nursing home . he was also on aldactone 50 mg. po q day . we decided to discontinue his lasixas this had resulted in increase in his creatinine . at the southnyra erwillte cinee memorial hospital he will need daily weights as well as daily lytes , specifically potassium , bun and creatinine to make sure that he can safely tolerate this dose of aldactone . he should also have a low salt , low potassium diet without concentrated sweets and 2 liter fluid restriction . he will also need t.i.d. fingerstick glucose and he will follow up with dr. fat at southnyra erwillte cinee memorial hospital . asaleysean ilon portal , m.d. , ph.d. tr : imj dd : 03/27/1998 td : 03/26/1998 2:37 pcc : asaleysean ilon portal , m.d. ri miengre tlandmaul , m.d. stat revised 3/31/98

she was transferred to retelk county medical center for further therapy , and transplant evaluation . patient also received aicd . history of present illness : the patient was initially admitted for further therapy of her idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and for transplant evaluation . patient 's past medical history is to besummarized as follows : in 1990 the patient was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy in hispit , delaware . since that time the patient has been treated medically . in 07/93 the patient underwent exercise tolerance test which showed a mbo2 of 12.7 mg per kilogram . on 09/93 the patient underwent transplant evaluation at retelk county medical center . echocardiogram showed severe pr and mitral regurgitation , mild ai and ejection fraction of 15% to 20% , a markedly dilated left ventricle and moderately dilated right ventricle , and a question of a possible left ventricular and right ventricular thrombus . consequently the patient was started on coumadin . catheterization at that time showed an ra pressure of 60 , cardiac index of 1.7 , svr of 2100 and a pvr of 387 . coronaries were completely normal . consequently the patient was admitted to the ccu for intensive hemodynamic monitoring , and after load reduction . in the ccu the patient was initially treated with nitroprusside and eventually switched to captopril and isordil . hemodynamics were optimized resulting in a cardiac output of 4.4 with a svr of 1300 and a wedge of 16 . pulmonary function tests were obtained which showed marked pulmonary dysfunction with fev1 of 1.4 and markedly decreased elcl of 50% . repeat pulmonary function tests following optimization of cardiac therapy showed somewhat improved but not to a significant degree of the pulmonary function tests . furthermore , due to the patient 's long standing amiodarone therapy , and a positive second pulmonary function , amiodarone was discontinued during that hospital admission . consequently the patient was discharged on captopril , digoxin , lasix , micronase , isordil and prn inhalers . the patient did well at home until 1/31/94 when she was admitted to souland in nixmont bovo with increasing congestive heart failure . at that time the patient was aggressively diuresed . by report , in the interim since discharge from retelk county medical center , amiodarone was restarted for unclear indications . dring this hospitalization at hahkellrick hospital , a dobutamine drip was started to improve hemodynamics , and in the setting of the dobutamine drip the patient had spontaneous ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest . she was quickly defibrillated and converted to sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block . she was treated for a short time with lidocaine and eventually weaned off . she was continued on low dose dobutamine and transferred back to retelk county medical center for further evaluation . the patient was transferred to retelk county medical center on 02/20/94 , again for possible heart-lung transplantation . the patient was evaluated by the chf and heart transplant service . it was felt that the patient was not likely a good transplant candidate secondary to endocurrent lung disease . furthermore , since it was felt that the patient failed amiodarone therapy , the patient was seen by the alllo eino hospital which recommended eps to rule out possible bundle branch reentry as the source of the patient 's arrhythmia with possible aicd placement if the eps was negative . note , per recommendation from the chf team , dobutamine was discontinued within the first 24 hours of the patient 's hospitalization without difficulty . on 02/22/94 an eps study was performed . the patient was negative for inducible ventricular arrhythmias despite maximal stimulation . consequently aicd placement was recommended . consequently , the patient underwent aicd placement on 03/09/94 . note , from 02/22 to 03/09 there is a question of the patient having a right forearm thrombophlebitis . consequently , the patient underwent a full 2 week course of antibiotic therapy along with debridement of the right forearm for placement of the aicd . note , biopsies from the right forearm were significant only for inflammation , and not infection . cultures were negative , and note , no pus or purulent fluid was found upon debridement . thus , aicd placement was performed on 03/09/94 following a 2 week course of antibiotic therapy for presumed ( but later found to be inflammation only ) of right forearm phlebitis . there were no intraoperative or postoperative complications following the aicd placement . by 03/10/94 the patient was able to ambulate without assistance , and was only having minimal tenderness at the aicd placement site . at this point it was felt the patient would go home on 03/13/94 . it was felt that the patient should stay inhouse over the weekend since the patient will be traveling back to vonamemp , la via plane by herself . this was discussed with both the patient and the cardiology b team . past medical history : type ii diabetes mellitus , cardiomyopathy , bronchitis , history of

mentioned in the history of present illness ( inadvertently placed in the history of present illness ) , the patient was admitted for further management , and evaluation of transplantation . as per history of present illness the patient was found to be a poor heart-lung transplantation candidate . an eps study was performed which was negative for inducible arrhythmia despite maximal stimulus . consequently , the patient underwent aicd placement on 03/09/94 . hospital course was only complicated by presumed right forearm thrombophlebitis , and the patient completed a 2 week antibiotic course prior to aicd placement . note , for the question of the right forearm thrombophlebitis , the right forearm was debrided and sent for culture and pathology . cultures were negative . debridement was negative for purulent discharge . pathology is only significant for inflammation , and not infection . the patient did well following the aicd placement . there were no intraoperative complications ,

probable brachial artery embolus . the plan is to perform an urgent embolectomy . the risks and benefits have been explained to the patient and consent has been obtained . hospital course : on 5-28-92 at 12:00 midnight the patient was taken to the operating room . the preoperative diagnosis as above was a left brachial embolus . the postoperative diagnosis , the same . the procedure was a left brachial embolectomy . the surgeon was dr. home and first assistant dr. home . the findings were a thromboembolism with propagated clot in the left brachial artery . there were no complications . the patient tolerated the procedure well and returned to the floor soon after the procedure . on postoperative day # 1 the patient was afebrile with stable vitals and he had a very strong left radial pulse and a warm hand . he was heparinized postoperatively and a cardiology consult was obtained . in addition echocardiography for the next day was arranged . the patient was seen on 5-29-92 by the ward cardiology consult . his assessment was that this was a 76 year old gentleman with atrial fibrillation and a dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy status post two embolic / thrombotic phenomena with a recent history of an upper gastrointestinal bleed . he recommended that the patient be heparinized as the scabeth t hospital surgery team had already done and that coumadinization be begun within a few days of heparinization . these recommendations were already underway . consequently we simply continued our management . the cardiology consult also spoke to the patient 's primary medical doctor , dr. blood in clear la who related that the patient had had two large esophageal ulcers and a history of polycythemia vera in the past . on 5-30-92 the patient 's gastroenterologist dr. ri blood was contacted . dr. blood was on vacation , however dr. kotethorereke , his partner was in the office and went through mr. flytheleungfyfe 's old chart and noted that dr. blood had performed esophagogastroduodenoscopy on the patient during his north carolina admission for an acute upper gastrointestinal bleed . during this time in january of 1992 dr. blood had noted two distal esophageal ulcers . he had treated both of these with epinephrine injection . follow up endoscopy on mar 15 , 1992 had shown two deformities in the distal esophagus corresponding to the presence of esophageal ulcers treated earlier in january . there was also a 4 cm. hiatus hernia from 36 cm. to 40 cm . the stomach and duodenum were otherwise normal . from dr. blood 's standpoint on mar 15 , 1992 there was no contraindication to coumadinization . we discussed coumadinization with dr. blood and noting dr. blood 's earlier findings we , in conjunction with dr. blood decided to coumadinize the patient and coumadinization was begun on 5-30-92 . it was noted at that time that a stable dose for the patient earlier when he had been coumadinized before was 5 mg. po q.day . that was concurrent with albuterol 150 mg. po q.day . given the patient 's history of ulcer and hiatus hernia and the fact that we did wish to anticoagulate the patient we actually performed upper endoscopy on the patient on 5-31-92 . the findings were as follows . the principal operating surgeon was dr. ca scgach with the assistance of dr. jesclinke . the principal findings were a 5.0 cm. hiatal hernia and apparent ingree and ot of weamanshy medical center 's esophagus distally . in the stomach there were mild erosions of the gastroesophageal junction without other abnormalities . there were no abnormalities into the second portion of the duodenum . the overall impression was that there was an apparent healed esophageal ulcer , a hiatus hernia , an esophageal mucosal changes distally were consistent with a barrett 's esophagus . no biopsy was taken . the biopsy was deferred because the patient had received a dose of coumadin the night before and had a prothrombin time of approximately 15 before the procedure . on 6-1-92 the patient went to the echocardiography suite . findings were : there was no evidence of intracardiac thrombus , although this was a transcardiac echocardiogram which is not the best technique for visualizing intraatrial thrombus . there was a thickened mitral leaflet with mild mitral regurgitation . there was focal calcification in the mitral annulus . the aortic leaflets were thickened with no aortic stenosis . there was trace aortic insufficiency . the aorta at the sinuses was ectactic at 42 millimeters . the left ventricular size and function were within normal limits with a left ventricular ejection fractio n of 57 percent . there was trace tricuspid insufficiency . there was evidence of an old pacer wire in the right atrium . there was trace pulmonary insufficiency with right ventricular systolic blood pressure of 35 millimeters . there was paradoxical septal motion consistent with bundle branch block . the patient , it should be noted at this time , was doing very well and he was taking regular diet , voiding spontaneously . he had been therapeutically heparinized since going to the operating room and by 6-2-92 his prothrombin time was beginning to elevate . on 6-2-92 he presented a new complaint with left wrist swelling and pain . he confessed to a history of gout in the past and consequently rheumatology consult was obtained . the rheumatologist entertained gout as an attractive diagnosis given his history and they aspirated the joint . joint aspirate was remarkable for calcium phosphate crystals , that is the patient actually had a case of pseudo-gout . joint aspirate that was sent for culture has been negative to date and today is 6-4-92 . the rheumatologist recommended checking a wrist xray to rule out calcification . a wrist xray was obtained of the left wrist and it did show chondrocalcinosis thus confirming the diagnosis of pseudo-gout . the patient 's pseudogout was treated with colchicine 0.6 mg. po q. 3 hours and he received nine such doses over a time span of about 42 hours with some relief of his symptoms . he is being discharged on colchicine 0.6 mg. po t.i.d. as an acute measure for his pseudo-gout and that prescription will last until he sees dr. blood in follow up this coming tuesday . today , on 6-4-92 , the patient has no new complaint . yesterday , on 6-3-92 , his prothrombin time was just a bit over 16 , between 16 and 17 and consequently his heparin was discontinued . today his prothrombin time is 16.7 and it looks like 5 mg. of coumadin per day is going to be a stable dose for him . consequently , he is ready for discharge today . the only other thing of note is that secondary to his anticoagulation with coumadin his ecotrin has been discontinued . medications on discharge : isordil 10 mg. po t.i.d. ditropan 5 mg. po q.i.d. cimetidine 400 mg. po b.i.d. omeprazole 20 mg. po b.i.d. colchicine 0.6 mg. po t.i.d. percocet 1 tablet po q. 4 to 6 hours prn and coumadin 5 mg. po q.day . disposition : the patient is being discharged to home today 9-1-25 . his plans for follow up include a return to the maza alllarow healthcare surgery clinic on 6-21-92 , that is two and a half weeks from the day of discharge ( 6-4-92 ) . he is to see his primary medical doctor , dr. telshey swatlleebtik in ki ave , sapo on tuesday , june 7 , 1992 , that is

thoracoabdominal incision for bleeding . history of present illness : the patient is a 42 year old female with known metastatic colon carcinoma , limited to the liver , who is referred to dr. duhenile for placement of an internal pump for hepatic arterial chemotherapy . the patient initially presented in september of 1992 with bloody diarrhea . she subsequently underwent a right colectomy in september of 1992 for a duke 's c-ii moderately well differentiated adenocarcinoma of the hepatic flexure . she subsequently recent adjuvant 5-fu and levamisole therapy but developed a right hepatic metastasis in september of 1993 . in thanksgiving of 1993 , the patient underwent a partial right hepatectomy . postoperatively , she did well , however she was noted to have a rising carcinoembryonic antigen level in february of 1994 , of 5.7 , and a 42.1 in april of 1994 . a computerized tomography scan obtained in april of 1994 revealed hepatic metastases involving both lobes . after two additional cycles of 5-fu and leucovorin , the patient had marked progression of her hepatic metastases associated with tumor fevers . the computerized tomography scans continued to demonstrate disease confined to the liver . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital on 7-28-94 for placement of an infusaid pump versus an exploratory laparotomy for liver resection . prior to surgery , the patient was taken to vascular radiology where she underwent superior mesenteric artery and ciliac angiograms . these demonstrated 1. portal vein patent , 2. normal hepaticanatomy with normal right and left hepatic arteries , 3. an enlarged liver with necrotic regions consistent with known colon metastatic tumors . the patient was subsequently brought to the operating room where she underwent a hepatic right trisegmentectomy . the operative findings were notable for a softball sized tumor in the right lobe of the liver , as well as multiple smaller tumor nodules . the left lateral segment was grossly free of tumor . the intraoperative course was notable for acute hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the fifties . the patient received 21 liters of lactated ringers solution , 16 units of packed red blood cells , and 21 units of fresh frozen plasma , and 12 units of platelets . there were 5300 cc given via the cellsaver . the patient was returned to the surgical intensive care unit . however , over the ensuing hours , the patient continued to have ongoing blood loss with hypotension . the decision was made to return the patient to the operating room . the patient was then returned to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy for bleeding . the operative findings were notable for bleeding from the inferior vena cava . the patient was returned again to the surgical intensive care unit . however , again the patient continued to demonstrate ongoing hypotension and transfusion requirements . the patient required blood pressure support with pressors . due to output of approximately 950 cc on placement of a right chest tube , the decision was made to return tothe operating room for exploration for bleeding . the patient was therefore explored through a right thoracoabdominal incision . the abdomen was again notable for bleeding from the inferior vena cava , a notable coagulopathy , and therefore , the abdomen was packed and the patient was returned to the surgical intensive care unit . however , over the subsequent 8-10 hours , the patient continued to demonstrate declining blood pressure despite maximal support with pressor agents including phenylephrine , norepinephrine , epinephrine , and dopamine . the patient continued to require transfusions . the patient 's oxygenation became increasingly difficult , as the chest x-rays demonstrated marked pulmonary edema . the ventilator settings demonstrated elevating peak inspiratory pressures up to 75 millimeters . the urine output dropped dramatically , and the patient was treated with lasix and mannitol for an attempt at forced diuresis . as the patient 's hemodynamic parameters demonstrated a narrow pulse pressure and rapidly elevated pulmonary artery pressures , the decision was made to perform echocardiogram to rule out potential paracardial tamponade . the study was considered to be inadequate , and it was unable definitively rule out the presence of such tamponade . despite maximal support with pressor agents , mechanical ventilation , and ongoing transfusion with fresh frozen plasma and packed red blood cells , and a protamine for treatment of the coagulopathy , the patient continued to demonstrate declining blood pressure , and subsequently expired with a cessation of heart rate and blood pressure

. blood cultures drawn on admission showed multiple organisms including clostridium perfringens , coagulase negative staph , and alpha hemolytic streptococcus . her antibiotics were appropriately changed . at the family 's request , the patient was transferred to heaonboburg linpack grant medical center for further evaluation . hospital course : further evaluation at heaonboburg linpack grant medical center , demonstrated that the patient had mitral valve endocarditis with mitral regurgitation that was initially managed medically . her antibiotics were appropriately adjusted because of the polymicrobial nature . cardiac echo showed that she had moderate mitral regurgitation , an enlarged left atrium , and good ventricular function . there was a suggestion of mitral valve vegetation . she was placed on intravenous antibiotics with gradual decrease in her temperature , although some low grade temperatures initially persisted . the patient had an extensive evaluation over the days that followed in order to find potential sources . she was evaluated by the gynecology service including the performance of a pelvic ultrasound and also by the gi service where she underwent a barium enema . there was no evidence of gi or pelvic disease which would account for the bacterial source . in addition , she was evaluated by the sileyer medical center and there was no evidence of active dental infection . she had a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging study performed and there was evidence of stroke . because of her complex picture , and because the source of her sepsis was not found , the initial plan was to treat with antibiotics and hopefully obtain a completely sterile surgical field for subsequent valve replacement , if indicated . her temperature became low grade and it was initially stable with her mitral regurgitation . towards the end of june , she had become afebrile and the initial plan was to complete a full course of antibiotics to obtain a sterile surgical field . a rash developed and antibiotics were appropriately changed and antibiotic levels were optimized . on 7/13 , she developed a sudden episode of pulmonary edema that resolved quickly and she was thought to have possible worsening of her mitral regurgitation . she was moved to the intensive care unit and underwent subsequent cardiac catheterization in preparation for possible surgery . her cardiac catheterization demonstrated minor coronary artery disease and severe mitral regurgitation with a suggestion of an annular abscess . after considerable discussion among the physicians involved in the patient 's care , it had become apparent that the mitral regurgitation had worsened . also , no source for sepsis had been found . because of worsening mitral regurgitation , and the findings of severe mitral regurgitation at cardiac catheterization , as well as elevated filling pressures , it was everyone 's opinion that the patient would not wait to complete a long course of antibiotics . accordingly , she was taken to the operating room on 7/21/93 . during her cardiac procedure , she sustained dissection of the ascending aorta . she , therefore , underwent graft replacement of her ascending aorta and mitral valve replacement . her valve was excised and any material that appeared infected was debrided . it was possible to clean the area thoroughly and it also became apparent that there was evidence of calcification in and around the annulus consistent with prior rheumatic fever . her valve was replaced with a st. jude medical mitral prosthesis and it was possible to place the valve securely . she weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with hemodynamics consistent with extreme vasodilation , and she required enormous doses of vasoconstrictors to maintain her blood pressure . she was bleeding after operation with her picture also consistent with coagulopathy , and the overall picture suggested the effects of systemic sepsis . in the early postoperative period , she had evidence of tamponade , possibly related to compression from her lungs , as the patient was noted to have elevated inspiratory pressures on the ventilator . the sternum was reopened with improvement in her hemodynamics and additional stability . she was returned to the operating room on 07/22 and underwent mediastinal exploration , removal of some mediastinal clot , and by now , hemostasis had improved . her sternum was left opened and the skin wound was left opened , using an elastic membrane to close the chest . with clotting factor replacement , bleeding gradually abated and was no longer a problem . she subsequently developed ongoing manifestations of sepsis with sustained vasodilation and developed anuric renal failure which required peritoneal dialysis . she remained on full support in the intensive care unit , on dialysis , with ongoing evidence of acidosis . despite full support on multiple , high dose inotropic and vasoconstrictor agents , her clinical status continued to deteriorate and it became apparent that her prognosis was extremely poor . after consultation with the family , it was decided to not resuscitate her and , with continued deterioration , she expired on 07/26/93 at 11:10 a.m. autopsy permission was granted . riemund c. graft , m.d. tr : qt / bmot dd : 07-26-93 td : 07/27/93 cc : collea douetscarv , m.d. gittetumn darnnaman graft , m.d.

{"id": 64, "label": 2, "text": "principal diagnosis : orthostatic hypotension . other problems : hyponatremia . hypokalemia . history of present illness : the patient is a 66 year old white female without a significant past medical history who presented in the middso memorial hospital emergency room following a nine day history of dizziness on standing without loss of consciousness . during the week prior to admission , the patient complained of severe constipation , dry mouth , possible urinary retention along with some nausea and vomiting . she felt that she was profoundly cold at the time . in the emergency room , the patient was hypotensive with an initial blood pressure of 92/70 and a pulse of 96 lying flat that became 70/50 with a pulse of 104 when standing . the patient was aggressively hydrated with a total of 9 liters of normal saline over a 7 hour period with marginal increase in blood pressure . over the same period of time , the patient became increasingly hypoxic and developed worsening hypertension . stat chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema . the patient was subsequently transferred to the micu on dopamine for further management . past medical history : only noticeable for remote appendectomy and being gravida v , para v . medications on admission : none . allergies : no known drug allergies . social history : the patient has an 80-pack-year history of tobacco and is currently smoking 1-2 packs per day . she also has a questionable alcohol history of up to one quart daily . she is married and lives with her husband . family history : notable for coronary artery disease in both parents without a history of cancer or autoimmune disease , diabetes , thyroid disease . physical examination : the patient was an agitated elderly white female . temperature 97.8 , blood pressure 112/58 on dopamine , pulse 134 , respirations 28 , oxygen saturation 93% on 100% nonrebreather . heent : showed pupils equal , round and reactive to light . extraocular muscles intact . oropharynx benign . eyebrows were notable for lateral thinning . neck was supple without lymphadenopathy . carotids were 2+ . no palpable thyroid . lungs showed decreased breath sounds bilaterally . cardiac exam revealed s1 , s2 with an intermittent s4 without murmur or rubs . abdominal exam was benign . extremities showed mild clubbing , no cyanosis and no edema . neurologic exam : the patient was alert , agitated and oriented to name , date and place moving all extremities . light touch was intact . admission labs : sodium 127 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 76 , bicarb 35 , bun 13 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 105 , serum osmolality 254 , hematocrit 43.5 , white count 10.0 with 68% polys , 20% lymphs and 10 monos . platelets 310 . pt and ptt were normal . lft 's were within normal limits . admission cortisol , aldosterone , b12 and folate and tsh were drawn . chest x-ray on transfer to the micu showed pulmonary vascular redistribution without infiltrate , effusions or nodules as compared with an admission chest x-ray which was interpreted as clear . hospital course : in the micu , the patient initially required dopamine for five days , at which point , she tolerated a wean without recurrent light headedness , dizziness or syncope . echocardiogram revealed preserved ejection fraction without regional wall motion abnormalities . the patient had a swan-ganz catheter placed which showed a cardiac output of 8 with systemic vascular resistance of 700 . because the swan-ganz readings were felt to be explained by sepsis , the patient was treated empirically with cefotaxime , gentamicin and flagyl . all cultures were subsequently negative with the exception of an e coli uti . the infectious workup included a lumbar puncture which was negative for pleocytosis but showed an elevated glucose of 106 and an elevated protein of 76 . the patient had an extensive workup for hypopituitarism . because addisonian crisis could not be initially ruled out , the patient was placed on distressed dose cortisone . however , a random cortisol level drawn initially in the emergency room subsequently returned as normal . the patient also responded appropriately to cortrosyn stimulation test . also , tsh was normal on admission . thyroid function panel drawn while the patient was on dopamine was subsequently abnormal . however , repeat panel was drawn when the patient was stable and had been transferred to the floor and was pending at the time of discharge . the patient was also evaluated by the neurology service for possible dysautonomia as the cause of her orthostatic hypotension with an inappropriate heart rate response to hypotension . emg showed no evidence of peripheral neuropathy . additional studies also included a head ct that showed a small lacunar infarct in the right pons and a partial empty sella which was confirmed by head mri . other studies sent during the workup included a negative serum and urine protein electrophoresis , negative serum and urine immunoglobulin electrophoresis . lh and ssh levels were consistent with a post-menopausal state . galactin levels were within normal limits . ana was negative . ace level was negative . heavy metal screen was negative except for a slightly elevated cobalt level so a possibility of a perineoplastic syndrome was considered . an anti-yo ri and who antibodies were sent and were pending at the time of discharge . on hospital day eight , the patient had uneventfully weaned off dopamine and was transferred to the floor . at that time , the stress dose hydrocortisone was weaned and the patient was switched to prednisone without any evidence of recurrent hypotension . her initial hyponatremia and hypokalemia resolved with stable sodium and potassium levels prior to discharge . in the studying of aggressive fluid resuscitation , it was felt that the patient had been sent into pulmonary edema . the patient auto-diuresed spontaneously . subsequent to the diuresis , reticulonodular diffuse pattern became apparent on chest x-ray . because of the patient 's significant smoking history , chest pt was performed to evaluate the possibility of lymphangitic carcinomatosis . however , the chest ct showed relative sparing of the lower lobes with primary involvement in both upper lobes . the patient following diuresis had no oxygen requirement whatsoever and had no respiratory complaints . prior to discharge , she was evaluated by the pulmonary service who felt that the differential diagnosis for her chest ct included eosinophilic granuloma , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , less likely sarcoidosis . because the patient had no respiratory symptoms , it was felt that her abnormal chest ct would be best evaluated as an out-patient . a new baseline chest x-ray was obtained prior to discharge . she will also require baseline pulmonary function tests as an out-patient . medications on discharge : prednisone taper 40 mg p.o. q day times two days , 30 mg p.o. q day times two days , 20 mg p.o. q day times three days , 10 mg p.o. q day times three days , 5 mg p.o. q day times three days . multi-vitamin one p.o. q day

{"id": 104, "label": 2, "text": "date of birth ; september 30 , 1917 principal diagnosis : left anterior temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage . associated diagnosis : atrial fibrillation , deep venous

procedures : arterial catheterization on 10/14/96 , head ct scan on 10/14/96 history and reason for hospitalization : granrivern call is a 79-year-old right handed white male with a history of questionable progressive supranuclear palsy , atrial fibrillation , deep venous thrombosis , and pulmonary embolus who presents with a change in mental status and a fall at home . his family stated that he had a progressive mental decline over the past three years and was initially diagnosed with parkinson 's disease or features consistent with parkinsonism . this was poorly responsive to eldopa . he was later seen by dr. flo cuchkote at the ph university of medical center and diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy . over the five to six weeks prior to admission he had a drop off in his mental functioning with more frequent episodes of confusion and disorientation and requiring more assistance with his activities of daily living . he also developed a urinary incontinence . he had had two falls to his wife 's recollection , both times slipping off the edge of a chair backwards . on the morning of admission at 8 o'clock , he was noted to be moving his mouth less and speaking \" gibberish \" . he was later sitting in a chair making multiple attempts to get up , which he subsequently did and promptly fell directly on his face at approximately 11:30 a.m. there was no definite clonic activity . there was no known incontinence . he was taken to an outside hospital and nasally intubated and then transferred to the ph university of medical center emergency room where he was orally intubated . a trauma evaluation was negative and thus he was transferred to the neurology service . medications on admission : coumadin 4 mgs po qhs , vasotec 5 mgs po qd , lasix prn , digoxin 0.25 mgs poqd , proscar and sinemet . allergies : no known drug allergies . past medical history : 1) atrial fibrillation on coumadin , 2) deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus ; the wife states since he was in the infantry in world war ii . 3) question progressive supranuclear palsy . 4) old right frontal infarct . 5) hypertension . social history : he lives with his wife who is his primary care giver . he is a former professor at montana . tobacco ; he has some distant history of some very minimal use . alcohol ; he has no recent use . he was a previous drinker of one \" old fashioned \" every night . family history : he has a father who had dementia . there was no history of strokes or bleeding disorders in the family . physical examination : vital signs in the emergency room were 210/100 for blood pressure , heart rate 70 and irregular . he was afebrile . in general he was an intubated elderly frail appearing white male with blood about his face . head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination ; abrasions about his forehead , there was some minimal swelling associated . his neck was rigid ; 1+ carotids without bruits . oropharynx was intubated with blood as well . lungs ; clear to auscultation bilaterally . cardiovascular examination ; regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops . abdominal examination ; soft , non-tender , non-distended , normal active bowel sounds . extremities : no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema . neurologically ; he opens his eyes to voice . he does not regard the examiner . he had no blink to threat . his pupils were three down to two on the right and five down to four on the left . according to the family this iansicoria was old . he had intact corneals bilaterally and intact horizontal dull movements bilaterally . he had left greater than right nasal stimulation to grimace . he had no gag to tube manipulation . motor examination he had a weak withdrawal to nail bed pressure in both hands . he triple flexed his bilateral lower extremities to pain . his deep tendon reflexes were 2+ at the right brachial radialis and right patella ; everywhere else his reflexes were 1 . his toes were down going . summary of laboratory and radiological examinations : sodium 141 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 107 , bicarbonates 23.8 , bun 23 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 165 , po2 377 , pco2 32 , ph 7.50 , asomus 298 , toxic screen negative , white blood cell count 11.1 , hematocrit 39.6 , platelet count 137 , prothrombin time 25.2 , inr 4.3 , partial thromboplastin time 34.7 , urinalysis 1+ albumin, 0-5 high link caths , cervical spine negative , pelvis negative , lumbar spine ; negative , thoracic spine negative . chest x-ray clear . electrocardiogram showed 2 mm of st depressions in v4-6 . head ct scan showed a 2 x 2 x 2 left anterior temporal hemorrhage with minimal surrounding edema . there was also evidence of an old right frontal infarction . hospital course and treatment : 1) neurology : the patient was admitted to the neurology intensive care unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition . he had an electroencephalogram performed on his initial admittance to the intensive care unit which did not show any evidence of seizure activity . it did , however , show diffuse slowing . he was given 1.5 grams of dilantin in the emergency room as well as 2 mgs of intravenous ativan which did little to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination . his hypertension ; his high blood pressure was controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine in the early going and then he was switched to an oral regimen for better control after he was removed from the intensive care unit . he continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his ability to move . he did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right , but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission . his diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was placed under question on further examination of his eye movement since he was able to have excellent superior gaze especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy . it was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process , but this was not clarified during this admission . it was not felt likely to be due to parkinson 's disease , as he had no significant response to eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of tremor , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic . he had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on october 18 , 1996 . this showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct , but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy . in addition , he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage , so tumor was felt to be unlikely . however , this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage . the etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out . 2) cardiovascular : his electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia . he was on intravenous tng and was supratherapeutic on his anti-coagulation . he did have a slight elevation of his tpk with an additional value of 198 with a mb fraction of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2.9 . that was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent ckmbs and was felt that he had a very small \" leaflet \" . he remained chest pain free throughout his admission . 3) pulmonary : after his initial intubation he remained quite stable . he was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex . however , he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission . 4) hematology : he had his prothrombin time reversed with vitamin k 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room . his anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation , but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed . it was decided that his goal inr was to be 2.0 . he did drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period , but his discharge inr was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time . it was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems . 5) gastrointestinal : he was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the ph university of medical center and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision . thus , his nasogastric tube was discontinued on october 19 , 1996 and he tolerated feeding quite well . in discussions with the family , given his age and number of medical problems , it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have a terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions . however , he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be a short term procedure . the family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good , but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary , short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest . disposition / plan on discharge : stable . doctor 's discharge orders : the patient was to be discharged to a rehabilitation hospital , the location of which was undetermined at this time of this discharge summary . the patient is to follow up with dr. ria in clinic on one month time and the family is to call me if there were any questions in the interim . medications on discharge : dilantin 100 mgs po tid , carafate 1 gram po qid , digoxin 0.25 mgs po qd , isordil 20 mgs po tid , captopril 25 mgs po

at about 29-30 , there is no urgent need to do an arteriogram which may cause further damage to the patient 's kidney . urology consultation thinks that cystoscopy would not add any benefit to the management and only would consider a right nephrostomy if renal function failed to improve . after admission , the patient was treated conservatively to correct his electrolyte and metabolic acidosis . he was given blood transfusion , two units when his hematocrit dropped to 29.4 . after transfusion , the patient 's hematocrit rose to 37.7 on the day of discharge . the patient was also given

{"id": 112, "label": 2, "text": "principal diagnosis : acute myocardial infarction . associated diagnosis : lower gastrointestinal bleed . history of present illness : the patient is a 65 year old portuguese male whose cardiac risk factors include hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , tobacco use and a positive family history . he was a previously healthy male who reports a pattern of intermittent chest pain during the week prior to admission . on the night prior to admission he was awakened from sleep with severe substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm , accompanied by back pain at about 9:30 p.m. he was taken to the pre health emergency room and at about 2:45 a.m. on 7/30 an electrocardiogram demonstrated 3 to 4 mm st elevations in leads v1 to v4 and 2 mm st elevations in lead v5 . he was treated with nitroglycerin , antacids and intravenous morphine . he was transferred to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital hemodynamically stable . he arrived in the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital emergency room with a blood pressure of 120/80 , heart rate 90 . an electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 with premature ventricular contractions . it was notable for 4 to 7 mm st elevations throughout the precordium with qs in leads v1 and v2 , with 2 mm st elevations in avl and 1 to 2 mm reciprocal st depressions in leads ii , iii and avf . the initial physical examination was notable for bright red blood per rectum . he was treated with intravenous nitroglycerin , intravenous morphine , aspirin , ativan and a lidocaine drip . because of the noted bright red blood per rectum , thrombolysis was deferred and the patient was taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory . past medical history : notable only for surgical repair of an ulcer and a remote appendectomy . medications on admission : none allergies : penicillin , which gives him a rash . social history : his habits include smoking one pack per day for many years and moderate to heavy alcohol use . physical examination : the patient was an elderly appearing male in no significant distress . his pulse was 84 and regular , blood pressure 114/70 . the head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable . the neck was supple . the carotids were of normal amplitude without bruits . on cardiac examination he had a nonpalpable left ventricular impulse , a quiet s1 and s2 , no murmurs . he had an audible s3 and a jugular venous pressure of 8 . on lung examination he had rales one third up bilaterally . his abdomen was soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly , no guarding and no rebound . on rectal examination he had bright red blood in the vault without any stool . his extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis or edema . laboratory data : the hematocrit was 44.9 , white blood count 14.3 , platelet count 301,000 , sodium 138 , potassium 3.7 , chloride 102 , co2 27.4 , bun 12 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 147 . the electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 , left atrial enlargement , st elevations in v4 through v6 , i and avl , consistent with acute anterolateral myocardial infarction with q waves in v1 to v3 and reciprocal st depressions in leads ii , iii and afv . the chest x-ray showed a normal cardiac and mediastinal silhouette , mild pulmonary edema and an elevated left hemidiaphragm . hospital course : the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where hemodynamic measurements included a right atrial pressure of 7 , a right ventricular pressure of 33/8 , pulmonary artery pressure 29/16 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 16 . he had a proximal 95% left anterior descending lesion and mild to moderate disease in the first obtuse marginal . the left anterior descending lesion was angioplastied to a 30% residual stenosis . an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in the left groin prophylactically . the patient was hemodynamically stable throughout and was transferred to the micu . on hospital day 2 the intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned . the patient was intermittently agitated while on the intra-aortic balloon pump and was treated presumptively for alcohol withdrawal with serax . the lidocaine drip was rapidly weaned as well . on the third hospital day the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed . the intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin were weaned off . after removal of the intra-aortic balloon pump the patient was noticeably less agitated . on the fourth hospital day an attempt was made to transfer the patient to the floor . however , after a single dose of 25 mg of po metoprolol , the patient 's blood pressure dropped to the 60/40 range and he was therefore kept in the micu . the peak cpk level was on the second hospital day and was 5,042 with 26.7% mb fraction . on the fifth hospital day the patient was considered stable for transfer to the floor . once on the floor the patient had no recurrent chest pain . an echocardiogram was performed on the sixth hospital day which demonstrated an ejection fraction of 44% . on transfer to the medical floor the patient was noted to have guaiac negative stool . he was evaluated by the gi service who felt that , given the patient 's course , he could undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy electively at some point in the future . the patient underwent exercise stress testing with thallium on the ninth hospital day . he exercised for 7 minutes and 30 seconds , achieving 80% of the maximal heart rate on the modified bruce protocol . he did not have chest pain . there were st and t wave abnormalities with 2.5 mm horizontal depressions at the beginning of 3 minutes of exercise , which persisted into recovery . the thallium images showed fixed anterior and septal wall defects without any definite evidence of redistribution . based on this data , on the tenth hospital day the patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization which demonstrated a patent left anterior descending site , a circumflex lesion after the third obtuse marginal , and a distal posterior descending artery lesion with a tight stenosis and a small vessel . these findings were considered not to be hemodynamically significant and the patient was therefore to be discharged on medical therapy including nitrates and aspirin . because of his persistently marginal blood pressure at 100/70 , an ace inhibitor which was tried briefly and a beta blockers were elected not to be continued . the patient was discharged in stable condition on the eleventh hospital day . discharge diagnoses : 1. acute myocardial infarction . 2. lower gastrointestinal bleed . medications on discharge : enteric coated aspirin , 1 po qd ; isordil , 10 mg po tid ; serax , 15 mg qhs x five days ; carafate , 1 gram po

{"id": 116, "label": 0, "text": "principal diagnosis : wolfe-parkinson white syndrome . associated diagnosis : atrial fibrillation , coronary artery disease , hypertension , dementia , and diabetes . history of present illness : the patient is a 72 year old white male who was transferred from cay memorial hospital of for cardiac catheterization and electrophysiology studies . his cardiac risk factors include : hypercholesterolemia , hypertension and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus . he has a history of chest pain and in january 1993 underwent a cardiac catheterization at ph university of medical center which revealed an occluded right coronary artery with distal filling via left to right collaterals , a large left anterior descending with a 40-50% proximal stenosis and a co-dominant left circumflex with mild disease . he subsequently had an echocardiogram in december 1994 which showed normal left ventricular size and systolic function . he subsequently had an adenosine sestamibi in february 1997 which was negative for ischemia or infarction . in december 1994 he had a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia presenting with palpitations . he was diagnosed with wolfe parkinson white syndrome . he underwent an electrophysiology study which identified an accessory pathway with multiple attempts at ablation by dr. slusslashgodle which were unsuccessful . he was treated with sotalol for the supraventricular tachycardia . on 9/2/98 he was admitted to cay memorial hospital of with palpitations and was found to have an irregular wide complex tachycardia thought to be due to atrial fibrillation and conduction down his accessory pathway . he had mild congestive heart failure and was treated with an increased dose of lasix . an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 50% and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation . he was discharged home but returned on 9/13/98 with worsening palpitations on and off . he was again found to be in a wide complex tachycardia and was treated with magnesium . he denied any associated chest pain or dyspnea and he ruled out for a myocardial infarction . he continued to have intermittent runs of the wide complex tachycardia and was therefore transferred to ph university of medical center for further evaluation and management . prior to transfer he did have one episode of chest pain during the night without electrocardiogram changes . past medical history : hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus , depression , prostate cancer status post surgery . medications on admission : sotalol 160 mg bid . atenolol 25 mg bid . prilosec 20 mg qd . propulsid 10 mg qd . nph and czi insulin . resulin 400 mg qd . lisinopril 10 mg bid . aspirin . lasix 60 mg qd . allergies : he reports an allergy to both codeine and iodine . there was also a question of an allergy to prednisone which he said causes eye swelling . however , the details of this are quite uncertain and it is not clear if this was a true allergy . physical exam : he was comfortable with a blood pressure of 156/78 , pulse 56 and respirations of 16 . his lungs were clear throughout . his apical impulse was nondisplaced with a regular rate and rhythm , normal s1 and s2 but not s3 or s4 . there was a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border radiating to the apex . carotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally and there was no jugular venous distention . his abdomen was benign . femoral pulses were 2+ bilaterally without bruits and he had pedal edema bilaterally . laboratory data : bun 18 , creatinine 1.8 , magnesium 1.5 , cholesterol 154 with an hdl 41 , ldl 100 . his creatinine phosphokinase was 42 . his hematocrit was 49.3 . his electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with a delta wave and an intraventricular conduction delay consistent with wolf parkinson white syndrome . there were also nonspecific st-t wave abnormalities . hospital course and treatment : the patient clearly was suffering from atrial arrhythmias conducting down his bypass tract which were difficult to manage and causing symptomatic palpitations . given his known coronary artery disease and his recent heart failure and chest pain a cardiac catheterization was indicated prior to proceeding to an electrophysiology study . his initial cardiac catheterization had to be postponed given the possibility of an allergy to prednisone . he was seen by nnoatal hospital center who felt that he could be safely treated with solumedrol rather than prednisone together with benadryl and the use of low ionic contrast medium . accordingly the patient underwent uneventful cardiac catheterization on 9/17/98 which revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25 and a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 20 . his right coronary artery was occluded and filled distally via left to right collaterals . he had a 50% proximal left anterior descending stenosis and only minor disease to the left circumflex . his left ventriculogram showed preserved systolic function and mild mitral regurgitation . the patient then underwent an electrophysiology study on 9/20/98 . there was no inducible supraventricular tachycardia but he did have evidence of a left lateral bypass tract . mapping of the mitral anulus confirmed the location of the bypass tract . radiofrequency ablation was applied there and resulted in the elimination of the preoperatively-excitation . there were no complications . following the procedure there was no further evidence of wide complex tachycardia . he still did have occasional short runs of atrial tachycardia but there were no associated palpitations . in following up his ablation he underwent a holter monitor which showed normal sinus rhythm at rates of 40 to 80 . there were 15 atrial runs the longest of which was 13 beats at a rate of 100 . he also underwent a post-procedural echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 61% with mild mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement at 45mm . following the procedure his qt interval was noted to be prolonged to approximately .55 seconds . his sotalol was therefore decreased to 120 mg bid and his qt and qtc intervals decreased to .45-.48 seconds . after the procedure he was started on heparin and loaded on coumadin for a period of the next 3-4 weeks following radiofrequency ablation . his inr was 2.3 prior to discharge and he was scheduled to follow-up with the anticoagulation clinic to follow his coumadin dose . finally , his dementia appeared to worsen following receiving medications for agitation during his ep study . accordingly he was seen by neurology who felt that there was no evidence of a secondary process . he did have a head ct which showed no evidence of a bleed or stroke . finally , his blood pressure had trended up during his hospitalization particularly with the decreased dose of sotalol . given his occasional sinus bradycardia his atenolol was not advanced but instead his zestril dose was increased from 10-20 mg bid and his blood pressure responded appropriately . condition on discharge : he was discharged in stable condition on 9/23/98 . he will have a visiting nurse to see him on iat . follow-up : he will follow-up with dr. taarnna service at ph university of medical center as well as dr. lupevickette folk and dr. dwainco rallsversgach

history of present illness : the patient is a 72 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease . he had experienced three myocardial infarctions since 1988 . he presented with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in december , 1994 and was admitted to tecal galecounxopt community hospital . the coronary angiogram performed during his hospitalization had revealed 95% of left anterior descending artery disease and diffuse left circumflex disease . an echocardiogram had revealed an ejection fraction of 41% with apicalakinesis . he had undergone electrophysiology study and his incessant ventricular tachycardia was interrupted by transcatheter radio frequency ablation . after the ablation procedure , programmed stimulation had initiated another ventricular tachycardia with distinct surface qrs configuration but since there was no spontaneous ventricular tachycardia , the other forms were not pursued vigorously . the patient was discharged while on procainamide and coumadin . on march 8 , he developed palpitations with shortness of breath and chest pain . the patient was admitted to an outside hospital in xingwa moineswest where a wide complex tachycardia with a rate of 160 beats per minute was demonstrated . the tachycardia had not responded to intravenous lidocaine or procainamide but has responded to intravenous verapamil . the patient was transferred to tecal galecounxopt community hospital for further evaluation . past medical history : the past medical history is notable for hypertension , left ventricular aneurysm and deep venous thrombosis which he experienced one month ago after the radio frequency ablation . physical examination : on admission physical examination , he was a well developed , well nourished elderly man in slightly dyspneic and uncomfortable condition . his blood pressure was 130/80 millimeters of mercury , and pulse was 80 beats per minute . the carotids were 2+ on both sides with bruits on each side . the jugular venous pressure was 7 centimeters . lung examination revealed crackling rales over the bases of both lungs . cardiovascular exam : normal sl and s2 . the abdomen was benign . extremities : no clubbing , cyanosis or edema . laboratory data : the chest x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the step down unit . the patient continued to experience multiple episodes of sustained and nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia . intravenous procainamide was started , which reduced the frequency and the duration of the ventricular tachycardia . on march 11 , the patient underwent an electrophysiology study . during the study , ventricular tachycardia with a cycle length of 510 milliseconds was reproducibly induced by extra stimuli delivered from the right ventricular apex . pace mapping studies had demonstrated that the origin of the tachycardia to be in the inferior , lateral and apical left ventricle . after mapping of the tachycardia , radio frequency ablation was carried out with four current applications , terminating the ventricular tachycardia in three of the four times . after radio frequency ablation , no sustained ventricular tachycardias occurred . however , there were periods of supraventricular tachycardias with a rate of 160-180 beats per minute and the patient was placed on sotalol . since the patient was known to have multiple different ventricular tachycardias , automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy was also offered to the patient . the patient agreed to proceed with automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy . on march 17 , the patient was taken to the pacemaker laboratory and a transvenous lead for the automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator ( cpi endotak c 0074 ) was placed . then , the patient was transferred to the operating room and a ventak prx model 1705 automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator system was implanted . the defibrillation threshold was less than or equal to 20 joules on several consecutive attempts . the patient 's postoperative course was uneventful . on march 19 , the patient was taken back to the electrophysiology laboratory where noninvasive programmed stimulation and automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator testing were performed . under brief propafol anesthesia , rapid ventricular tachycardia was induced by ramp pacing . this was properly detected and converted to normal sinus rhythm with a single 34 joule countershock . three zones were programmed in the cardiac defibrillator . for tachycardias with heart rate between 110 and 140 beats per minute , no therapy was programmed . for tachycardias with heart rates between 140 and 175 , anti-tachycardia pacing followed by cardioversion is programmed . for tachycardias faster than 175 beats per minute , cardioversion and defibrillation was programmed . vvi pacing at 40 beats per minute was also programmed . the patient felt good on the morning of march 20 . the patient was discharged home in stable condition on the regimen described above . he will have his prothrombin time checked on monday and will follow up with the defibrillator clinic . ann

studies and overnight oximetry saturation monitoring . history of present illness : mr. state is an 81-year-old man with a history of restrictive and obstructive lung disease , dilated cardiomyopathy , inferior myocardial infarction , and anterior mediastinal masses admitted with acute onset of pulmonary edema . in the setting of inadvertently decreasing lasix from 80 mg. po 40 mg. a day mr. state had sudden onset dyspnea after approximate day and a half prodrome culminating in severe dyspnea . upon arrival in the emergency room mr. state 's saturations were in the mid 80s and he was promptly rendered more comfortable with high flow oxygen , morphine , and nitrates and intravenous lasix . chest x-ray was relatively unrevealing for interstitial or alveolar edema and with clinical improvement ensued with the immediate therapy in the emergency room as noted . the patient denied angina , syncope , preceding worsening orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations , chest pain , hematemesis or melena . past medical history : is notable for an inferior myocardial infarction , restrictive and obstructive lung disease with an fev1 of .9 and fvc of 1.34 and a moderate at best response to bronchodilators , and a negative sestamibi scan in may , 1999 apart from a severe fixed inferolateral defect , systolic dysfunction with recent echocardiography revealing an lvid of

. in addition , mr. state has an anterior mediastinal mass 2x2x1.7 cm. by recent computerized tomography scan without surrounding or adjacent adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease apart from bronchiectasis . his cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ana , negative spep , upep and benz-jones proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative . the patient lives on quelene with his wife . he is a non-smoker and drinks rare alcohol . physical examination : the patient was a very pleasant man who appeared his stated age . blood pressure was 155/60 , heart rate 70 with occasional premature ventricular contractions , respirations 14 . mr. state was dyspneic speaking in short sentences initially on high flow oxygen . jugular venous pressure was 8 with a brisk inspiratory descent . there was no thyromegaly . carotids were 2+ . breath sounds were decreased at the bases only with distant heart sounds and a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur consistent with aortic stenosis with gallavardin like radiation to the apex . abdomen : soft , nontender with hepatosplenomegaly , or hepatojugular reflex , bruits or pulsations . there was no rash and no edema and the neurological examination was non-focal . laboratory data : notable for a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.6 , bun 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 104 , hematocrit 42 , white count 8.7 , platelet count 235 and a pt of 12.9 seconds . the urinalysis was negative . the troponin i was less than .4 and the creatine kinase was 114 . chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases . the electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations . after a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent . prior to catheterization a vq scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for pe with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung . subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and d-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent . it was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto . coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries . after a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute . based upon these findings it was felt that mr. state most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state . in hospital he was seen by both speech therapy , physical therapy , and the uspend harmemewood medical center congestive heart failure nurse practitioner program . his isordil was increased in hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 . future adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures . at a goal weight of 142 pounds , mr. state 's filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home . the patient will be followed by dr. state within a week of discharge and by

graft surgery , severe left ventricular dysfunction , chronic renal insufficiency . allergies : sulfonamides . principal procedure : cardiac catheterization - 4/1/93 - two dimensional echocardiogram 3/27/93 . doctors discharge orders : lasix 40 mg qd ; digoxin 0.25 mg qd ; aspirin 325 mg qd ; isordil 10 mg tid . history of present illness : mr. breun underwent a six vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure in march , 1990 , following a complicated inferior posterior myocardial infarction . he had a very stormy course , dominated by post infarction angina pectoris , high grade atrial ventricular block , gastrointestinal bleeding , pneumonia , and no noliguric renal failure . an intra-aortic balloon pump was required for stabilization . he also had moderately severe aortic stenosis at that time with a peak aortic valve gradient of 30 , and a calculated valve area of 1.2 cm squared . despite the magnitude of these problems , he made a remarkable recovery over the course of several months , and was able to return to work on a part-time basis , after joining a program of cardiac rehabilitation . postoperatively , we measured a left ventricle ejection fraction of 40% , by gated cardiac blood pool scanning . over these past 3 years , he has remained stable , on a very simple program of aspirin , and atenolol . he returned for routine office evaluation on 3/25/93 , complaining of 2 months of progressive exertional dyspnea , with occasional chest discomfort , and , more recently , orthopnea , cough , peripheral edema , and weight gain . physical examination : weight 197 lbs , up 6 lbs , blood pressure 128/88 , heart rate 70 and regular . the venous pressure was markedly elevated to 15 cm . the carotids were of low volume , and sluggish bilaterally , with transmission of a basal heart murmur . there was dullness at both bases , with rales 1/3 way upon the right , and at the base on the left . the right ventricle , and left ventricle impulses were diffuse . there was a grade i-ii murmur of aortic stenosis , with additional murmurs of tricuspid , and mitral regurgitation , and an obvious s3 . the liver was enlarged 2 finger breadths below the right costal margin , and there was 1-2+ peripheral edema . his chest x-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly , with bilateral pleural effusions , right greater than left , and pulmonary vascular re-distribution . the electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with first degree av block , an old inferior myocardial infarction , and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction , and non-specific st-t wave abnormalities , that were unchanged compared to june , 1992 . later , an echocardiogram on 3/27/93 , demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with calcification of the annulus , and incomplete closure of the valve , consistent with papillary muscle dysfunction . the left atrium was dilated to 52 mm . the aortic valve was thickened , with restrictive motion , and there were indistinct mobile echo densities on the leaflets . there was evidence of trace aortic regurgitation , however , due to technical difficulties , accurate gradients could not be estimated . the left ventricle was dilated , with concentric hypertrophy , and multi segmental wall motion abnormalities , with a reduced ejection fraction of 24% . there was also doppler evidence of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary insufficiency . a persantine thallium scan on 3/31/93 , showed increased lung uptake , cavity dilatation and a large inferior , apical scar , without evidence of active ischemia . laboratory data : potassium 4.4 , bun and creatinine 33/1.7 , albumen 3.6 , total bilirubin 1.8 , direct bilirubin 0.5 , ck 162 , with 11.1 mb for a relative index of 6.9% . this was of uncertain significance . the hematocrit 43.2 , whiteblood count 9.2 , prothrombin time 10.4 , partial thromboplastin time 34.2 , urinalysis had 1+ albumen and 0-2 white blood cells , per high power field , with a culture that demonstrated rare enterococcus . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the medical service , and placed at bed rest , and given intravenous furosemide . over the course of the next few days , we succeeded in having his weight decrease from its value of 189 lbs , to as low as 177 1/2 lbs . coincident with this , his clinical condition improved markedly , and he became fully ambulatory . given the difficulties in trying to assess the exact mechanism by which his heart failure had occurred , we proceeded to cardiac catheterization on 4/1/93 . at the time of this study , the right atrial pressure was 1 , the pa pressure 32/10 , and the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 10 . there was a 40-50 mm peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve , a mean gradient of 40 , and a calculated valve area of 0.5 cm squared , using a cardiac output of 3.4 liters per minute . left ventriculography demonstrated marked left ventricle dilatation . there was mild mitral regurgitation , a posterior basil aneurysm , and akinesis of the apex , septum , and inferior walls . the anterior lateral wall was severely hypokinetic , and the posterior lateral wall moderately kinetic . the aortic valve was calcified with reduced excursion consistent with his aortic stenosis . a dominant right coronary artery had an 80% proximal stenosis , and was then occluded at the acute margin . a large right ventricular marginal branch did fill the saphenous vein graft in a retrograde fashion . the posterior descending artery had an 80% stenosis proximal to the insertion of the graft . the left anterior descending was proximally occluded , and the left circumflex had a 90% stenosis in the first marginal branch , and 90% stenosis distally in other branches . the saphenous vein graft to the right ventricular acute marginal and posterior descending artery was patent with good runoff . the saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending had a minor plaque at the distal anastomosis . the saphenous vein graft to three distal marginal branches was patent with good flow . certainly , the cardiac catheterization was consistent with severe aortic stenosis in the presence of profound left ventricular systolic dysfunction . these findings were reviewed with dr. patella and together we decided that conservative therapy would be the appropriate first choice in mr. breun 's management . his advanced age , prior cardiac surgery and advanced left ventricular dysfunction , together with his chronic renal insufficiency , would certainly complicate to an enormous degree any undertaking as risky as redo surgery for aortic valve replacement . percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty , on the other hand , would only be a temporary procedure and did not seem necessary even for transient symptomatic relief given his marked improvement following a rather conventional course of intravenous diuretics . it is very unlikely that we will offer mr. breun aortic valve replacement surgery in the future . he seems to agree with this particular approach as the quality of life has become very important and appropriate issue for him . he is looking forward to returning home and going back to work on a part time basis at the local pharmacy . we will see how far we can get with medical therapy although mr. wierst and his family clearly understand the long term implications of his aortic stenosis . ethelan kotefyfechird , m.d. tr : go / bmot dd : 4/4/93 td : 04/06/93 cc :"}

{"id": 138, "label": 1, "text": "principal diagnoses : 1 ) thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura . 2 ) bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia . 3 ) renal failure requiring chronic dialysis . history of present illness : the patient is a 63 year-old woman transferred from pre health on june 19 , 1998 to the verg medical center intensive care unit for evaluation of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia . on may 12 , 1998 , the patient presented to pre health with fever , cough , dyspnea and a chest x-ray revealing a patchy infiltrate in the right lung . she was treated with clindamycin and erythromycin which were changed to trovan and then transferred to a hospital . on may 27 , 1998 , the patient desaturated to 40% with a temperature of 100.5 degrees . her oxygen saturations improved to only 92% on 100% face mask and she was admitted to pre health intensive care unit . chest x-ray there revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with increasing pleural effusion . a vq scan was high probability , but no pulmonary angiogram was done and an echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricle with no wall motion abnormality and an ejection fraction of 75% . on may 24 , 1998 , the patient had a ct scan of the chest which revealed diffuse alveolar infiltrates at the right base , mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions . at this point , a diagnosis of lupus was considered and her ana was 1:640 and her rheumatoid factor and anca were negative . she was started on a steroid trial at that point . her pleural fluid was tapped and it was negative for malignancy . on june 11 , 1998 , the patient had a video assisted thoracoscopic study of the right lung which revealed chronic interstitial pneumonitis with a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia-like reaction and a chest tube was placed . the patient was then started on 40 mg of prednisone q. day . from may 27 , 1998 through june 19 , 1998 , the patient had a decline in her platelets from 394 to 28 with a stable hematocrit of 32 to 33 and a rise in creatinine from 1.0 to 3.8 . on june 19 , 1998 , she was transferred to the verg medical center medical intensive care unit for evaluation of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura . past medical history : 1 ) cerebrovascular accident in 1995 in the pontine region secondary to hypertension . 2 ) hypertension . 3 ) status post hysterectomy . 4 ) status post appendectomy . medications on transfer : 1 ) albuterol inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d. 2 ) lasix p.r.n. 3 ) prednisone 40 mg p.o. q. day . 4 ) inderal 40 mg p.o. q.i.d. 5 ) thiamine . 6 ) lasix p.r.n. 7 ) atrovent inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d. 8 ) folic acid . 9 ) premarin 0.625 mg p.o. q. day . 10 ) omeprazole 20 mg p.o. q. day . 11 ) insulin sliding scale . allergies : the patient had no known drug allergies . social history : the patient is divorced . she has two children . she recently retired as a clerical worker . she denies any tobacco . she has only social alcohol use . family history : father died at age 56 of coronary artery disease . mother died at age 68 of pancreatic carcinoma . brother has coronary artery disease . there is no family history of hematologic problems . laboratory : laboratory studies on admission were notable for a sodium of 131 , potassium 6.2 , bun 111 , creatinine 3.9 , white blood cell count 23 , hematocrit 27 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on the smear , platelet count 92 and ldh 496 . hospital course : 1 ) bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia : the video assisted thoracoscopic study at the outside hospital was consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia . the patient was continued on steroids throughout the course of her stay . this was changed to solu-medrol part way through the course due to her hematologic problems , see below . by discharge , she was returned to 40 mg of prednisone q. day times one month to be followed by a slow taper . the patient 's bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia appeared to improve slowly throughout her hospital course , however on july 12 , 1998 , after starting dialysis ( see below ) , the patient desaturated and required supplemental oxygen . repeat chest x-rays and chest ct scans appeared consistent with pulmonary edema from volume overload given her renal failure and eventually , the patient 's pulmonary status did improve after significant volume removal with dialysis for several weeks . at the time of her discharge , the patient was still requiring two liters of supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations in the mid 90% . 2 ) thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura : the patient was initially admitted with platelet count of 28 , hematocrit of 32 , ldh of 496 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on her smear . this was felt to be consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and on june 20 , 1998 , she was started on daily plasma exchange which continued through july 27 , 1999 . she was also changed to intravenous solu-medrol 50 mg q. day which was changed back to 40 mg of prednisone prior to discharge . her platelet count initially rose to a maximum of 159 on july 3 , 1998 , then they steadily fell to a low of 60 on july 20 , 1999 . her ldh which peaked at 1255 decreased to the mid 200s , but remained elevated . she continued to have a few schistocytes on her smear , but it was much decreased . the patient also required red blood cell transfusions , approximately two units every seven to ten days to maintain her hematocrit . eventually , her plasma exchange was tapered to a smaller and smaller dose each day and then discontinued altogether after july 27 , 1999 . after this , the patient 's platelet count rose to a maximum of 177 on discharge . it is felt that the patient 's thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has resolved . she will continue on her prednisone for one month as above for the bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia with a very slow taper . 3 ) renal : the patient presented in acute renal failure with a bun of 101 and a creatinine of 3.7 . throughout the month of june , she had a rising potassium phosphate and increasing volume overload with decreasing response to diuretics and she was finally initiated on dialysis with ultrafiltration on july 12 , 1998 . the opinion of the renal consult was that this was permanent and non-reversible renal failure since it did not improve with dialysis and the patient will continue on dialysis three times per week . she required approximately five liters of ultrafiltration fluid removal at each dialysis session due to her significant volume overload . during the course of her dialysis , she had a great improvement in her lower extremity edema and her oxygen saturation . 4 ) infectious disease : the patient had multiple line infections during her admission including a confirmed coag. negative staphylococcus line infection with positive blood cultures on june 23 , 1998 , july 4 , 1998 , july 8 , 1998 and july 9 , 1998 . the patient eventually had a left subclavian tesio catheter placed and a right brachial picc line placed on july 10 , 1998 which remained patent and uninfected . she received a full three week course of vancomycin and also received a three week course of ceftazidime . in addition , she had a fungal urinary tract infection treated with amphojel bladder irrigation , which was followed by a klebsiella urinary tract infection for which she received levofloxacin times fourteen days . she also received a fourteen day course of acyclovir which was begun on june 21 , 1998 for perianal lesions consistent with herpes simplex virus . she was also on fluconazole for some oral thrush which was inadvertently continued for a total of thirty days . the patient was also started on bactrim one double strength tablet q.o.d. as prophylaxis for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while on her high dose steroids . 5 ) rheumatology : the patient was admitted with a question of lupus given her ana of 1:640 although her rheumatoid factor and anca were negative . unfortunately throughout her admission , we were unable to test any more titers since she was receiving daily plasma exchange . a repeat ana , rheumatoid factor and anca may be repeated as an outpatient . follow-up : 1 ) the

left lung with scattered nodules in the right upper lung . these nodules are confirmed by chest ct and demonstrated to be smaller than 3 millimeter peripheral nodules appearing in both lung apices . the ct also demonstrated questionable right hepatic hemangioma and multiple tubular hypodensities were hepatic veins should be . hospital course and treatment : because of the extensiveness of ms. abreun 's hospital course it will be organized by system : 1. neurological : on admission the patient was intubated and sedated . her sedation was gradually weaned during her first month in the intensive care unit and she was noted to have an underlying depression and history of obsessive compulsive disorder as listed from the patient and her family . a psychiatric evaluation was obtained and she was placed on paxil at 5 milligrams which was gradually increased to a total of 20 milligrams po q day at the time of her admission . on august 29th , ms. abreun again required sedation when she found apneic and hypotensive . she spent several days in the intensive care unit at that time , during which her sedation was gradually weaned back to off . 2. pulmonary : ms. abreun was admitted , sedated and on a respirator , requiring minimal settings with a pressure support of 10 and a pep of 5 . after two weeks of intubation on july 25th the patient went to the operating room for a tracheostomy which she tolerated without issue . over the next several weeks , the ventilatory support was gradually weaned to off . by august 9th she was tolerating trach mask trials and was on the verge of tracheostomy removal by august 29th . at this time , she had a sudden episode of respiratory distress accompanied by hypotension and unresponsiveness . she was bag masked and taken immediately to the intensive care unit where she was placed on respiratory support with simv settings which were gradually weaned over the course of her ten days in the intensive care unit . after her wean from the respiratory , she was transferred back to the floor and over the next several days tolerated trach mask trials admirably and had her tracheostomy removed on september 16th , 1998 . at the time of her discharge , she had no acute respiratory issues . 3. cardiovascular : ms. abreun was admitted on cardiac support requiring 30 of neo-synephrine . she was placed on a swan gans catheter monitor and gradually weaned off the neo-synephrine by the 22nd of july . she required no further support and had no further issues until august 29th when she had her respiratory crisis and was transferred to the unit . at this time her dramatic pressure drop required dopamine support at levels of 500 micrograms per minute . a swan gans catheter floated at this time demonstrated an svr of 500 . she was supported with dopamine and with fluid and was slow to come off the dopamine requiring approximately 8 to 10 days for full weaning . after the wean she required no further cardiac medication and had no further issues . 4. renal : ms. abreun 's fluid management was an important contributor to her hospital course . she presented with massive ascites and anasarca for which she received large volume diuresis with regular lasix dosing daily . renal parameters were normal until the time of her respiratory cardiovascular crisis on august 29th . at this time , it was noted that her bun jumped to levels of approximately 80 , while her creatinine stayed at levels of .6 to .7 . an elevation by dr. freiermthalskush of renal medicine at first suspected a subclinical congestive heart failure as being responsible for a prerenal azotemia , however on further elucidation of the patient 's course , it is evident that a broad sepsis caused by her pneumonia was responsible for her decreased svr and eventual renal hypoperfusion . her azotemia responded readily to pressor support and fluid resuscitation . at the end of her second intensive care unit admission , her bun and creatinine had resolved to normal values . 5. gastrointestinal : ms. abreun was admitted nothing by mouth , intubated on intravenous fluids alone . she was immediately begun on total parenteral nutrition therapy for what would be a prolonged course without po intake . on july 25th a g tube was placed and feeds were begun gradually . these g tube feeds were gradually increased with a total parenteral nutrition wean , however at the time of her re-admission to the intensive care unit on august 29th aspiration was suspected and all tube feeds were held . she was maintained on total parenteral nutrition for the course of her time in the intensive care unit . at the end of this time , she was begun gradually on g tube feeding , however she was able to tolerate only very small volumes and produce large aspirates . this problem had remained and been ongoing for the remainder of her hospital at fairm of ijordcompmac hospital . she is currently being supported on tube feeds of vivonex at a rate of approximately 20 and hour with aspirates being measured q 4 hours and measuring from 30 to 250 regularly . she has also been supplemented with glutamine 10 grams b.i.d. via the g tube in hopes of reviving what most certainly be her gut atrophy from prolonged disuse . ms. abreun , from the onset of her stay at fairm of ijordcompmac hospital demonstrated elevated alkaline phosphatase levels in isolation from her other liver function tests . these values ranging as high as 2300 were evaluated by gastrointestinal consult who came and performed and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which demonstrated a normal biliary system with diameters on the large end of normal . stone was demonstrated in the gallbladder , but there was no evidence of obstruction and the study was ready as normal . 5 'nucleotidase values have also been elevated ranging from 150 to 180 . to date there has been no satisfactory explanation for these elevations in alkaline phosphatase and 5 'nucleotidase and all associated studies have been negative . further evaluation of this during her later hospital stay or as an outpatient . 6. infectious disease : ms. abreun underwent a work up for tuberculosis at the beginning of her hospital course . she ruled out by ppd . the initial management of her necrotizing fascitis was empiric with imipenem , flagyl and vancomycin . because of the extent of her wound , she was also treated with hyperbaric oxygen which was of some benefit in resolving her infection . the course of flagyl , imipenem and vancomycin was continued for fourteen days . at this time imipenem were discontinued and vancomycin was maintained alone for additional several days . she then went without antibiotic therapy for a period of several weeks until her crisis of august 29th . on admission to the unit , she was begun on triple antibiotic therapy with levo / vanc/flagyl . shortly thereafter gentamicin was added to the regimen which was maintained for a period of one week until cultures came back and her therapy could be stream lined to vancomycin , levofloxacin alone . after a ten day course of levofloxacin it was discontinued , vancomycin was maintained for five additional days , after which time , it was discontinued as well and she was without antibiotics . on discharge , she was currently taking no antibiotics . ms. abreun entered the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital having taking only oral hypoglycemic agents for control of her diabetes . because of the stress of her infection and intensive care unit admission she was requiring sliding scale insulin for the full course of her hospital stay . her total parenteral nutrition was also supplemented with insulin nph for better control . her total parenteral nutrition is currently supplemented with 30 units nph q day and she is on a sliding scale to control the remainder of her sugars . ms. abreun 's hypothyroidism diagnosed shortly before her admission was an important aspect of her therapy during her course at fairm of ijordcompmac hospital . her thyroid necessity was poorly controlled with a synthroid dose of 0.125 milligrams for the majority of her stay . at the time of her admission to the intensive care unit on august 29th it was noted that she had a thyroid stimulating hormone that was dramatically raised to a value of 26.83 . more active supplementation was performed increasing her dose to .3 milligrams q day , which caused a rapid resolution of her thyroid studies and an improvement in her physiology almost immediately . she has since been maintained on a dose of 0.2 milligrams iv q d . however , she has had a gradual rise in her thyroid stimulating hormone to a value of 6.68 . her discharge medication will include synthroid dose of 0.3 milligrams po q day with recommendation that this parameter be followed closely . in summary : ms. abreun is a fifty nine-year-old female who presented with necrotizing fascitis of the right hip , status post debridement , severely debilitated by the extent of her infection . over the course of 2 months this infection was cleared , the wound was cleaned and split thickness skin grafting was successful in covering over the wound . her course , however was complicated by an methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was resistant to therapy and which produced a profound sepsis which caused a hypotensive ana apneic episode which required intensive care unit support for a period of a week . her course was also complicated by her hypoactive thyroid function which went unrecognized for some period , but has since resolved with aggressive synthroid therapy . currently , her most issues are the advancement of her tube feeds and the restarting of her po intake which was planned to begin for the next several days before her transfer was initiated . her wound also requires further care as smaller areas of non-take in the graft are being management with sterile saline wet to dry dressings . condition on discharge : stable with issues resolving . medications on discharge : heparin 5,000 units sub q b.i.d. prilosec 20 milligrams per g tube q day . paxil 10 milligrams per g tube

the scan was aborted and he was taken directly to the operating room at 03:00 . at laparotomy , there was a liter of blood in the peritoneal cavity . there was a class ii laceration of the left liver at the falciform ligament which was actively bleeding , a tear of the transverse mesocolon from its base to the bowel wall with active bleeding , a 7 cm serosal tear of the adjacent transverse colon , and a large central retroperitoneal hematoma . control of the super-celiac aorta was obtained , and both left and right sided \" mattox \" maneuvers were performed . the retroperitoneum was opened , with vigorous bleeding resulting . this was controlled , necessitating ten minutes of aortic clamping and found to have originated from the rupture of the left renal vein one centimeter from its junction with the inferior vena cava . the vein was divided and suture ligated . bleeding from the liver was controlled with sutures . the tears in the transverse mesocolon and colon serosa were repaired . the examination of the remainder of the abdominal contents revealed no other injury ; in particular , the entire anterior surface and the immediately juxtaduodenal posterior surface of the pancreas were normal . the patient was now very stable , and he was taken to the respiratory intensive care unit . the patient had received ten units of packed red blood cells , five units of fresh frozen plasma , seven units of platelets , and nine liters of ringer 's lactate . an intracranial pressure monitoring bolt had been placed by the neurosurgery service staff during the laparotomy . intracranial pressures were normal . that day , cranial computerized tomography scan and cervical spine films were normal . an arch aortogram was normal . over the ensuing twenty-four hours , bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray with poor oxygenation and labile blood pressure requiring pa line guided fluid and pressors developed . the patient had a large fluid requirement with total body capillary leak , decreasing svr , oliguria unresponsive to lasix / mannitol accompanied by a rise in creatinine to 3.2 , worsening ards , a rise in temperature to 103 , and a serum amylase of 1265 . he was returned to the operating room on july 4 . three liters of clear green fluid were found in the abdominal cavity . exploration of the pancreas revealed a posterior fracture a the superior mesenteric vessels . because of the intense diffuse inflammatory reaction that had already set in , it was decided that neither distal pancreatic resection nor roux-en-y drainage was feasible . four large flat jackson-pratt drains were placed , and gastrostomy , jejunostomy , and cholecystostomy tubes , as well as a right subclavian quinton catheter were placed . the patient 's hemodynamics had improved markedly with the evacuation of the peritoneal pancreatic fluid , so that he was no longer on pressors . however , upon transfer from the operating room table to the ricu bed , he suffered a cardiac arrest , which upon investigation was a primary respiratory arrest ;

(2) coronary artery disease , status post myocardial infarction with tpa thrombolysis . cardiac catheterization showed sequential lad and she underwent angioplasty twice to the lad with good results . an echocardiogram in june of 1994 showed an ejection fraction of 40-45% . her baseline electrocardiogram showed a left bundle branch block . (3) noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus . (4) osteoporosis . (5) hypercholesterolemia . (6) history of herpes zoster . (7) status post appendectomy . (8) status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the surgical service under the care of dr. lenni pain . her abdominal exam revealed a diffusely tender abdomen which was greater in the lower quadrant without guarding , but with early peritoneal signs . a kub performed on the night of admission showed no free air and no small bowel obstruction or ileus . an abdominal ct scan with oral contrast did not show any evidence for fluid collection or abscess . however , there was diffuse thickening of the small bowel up to the terminal ileum , as well as some thickening of the rectum . this was not in a clear vascular distribution and there was no air evident in the wall of the small or large bowel . these findings were felt to be consistent with radiation enteritis . she was admitted and made npo . on admission , her white count was 15,000 with an absolute neutrophil count of 1,000 . she was initially afebrile and hemodynamically stable . her anc dropped to about 200 over the next 48 hours and she developed guaiac positive diarrhea . she was begun on iv antibiotics on admission of mezlocillin , gentamicin and metronidazole . she was also placed on neutropenic precautions . she continued to spike fevers and had episodes of peritoneal signs . however , repeated abdominal x-rays and ct scans continued to show no signs of obstruction or perforation . however , she did show persistent inflammation of her small bowel consistent with radiation enteritis . by 7/15/96 she was no longer neutropenic but continued to spike low grade fevers . by 7/18/96 she had become afebrile and antibiotics were discontinued . she was continued on bowel rest and four days prior to discharge she became entirely pain free in her abdomen and was started on tpn . of note , a picc line was placed for facilitating the administration of tpn . of note , shortly after starting on her tpn her phosphate level dropped to 1.8 and tpn was temporarily held due to concerns she may be suffering from receding syndrome . she was supplemented with neutra-phos and her tpn was restarted 18 hours later . discharge plan : we recommend that she continue to rest her bowel for another seven days . during this time she will continue to receive tpn . after that period of time she should slowly start p.o. intake again starting with clear liquids and in particular avoiding fats and lactose . her small bowel is likely to be intolerant to lactose for the near future . discharge medications : insulin sliding scale b.i.d. , lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q. day , neutra-phos 500 mg p.o. q. day , metopromide 10 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. nausea , nitroglycerin 1/150 tablets one sublingually q. 5 minutes x three p.r.n. chest pain , nizatidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , ativan 1 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. nausea , nafcillin dose 4 mg in 24 hours , and tpn . make sure her tpn at this point is 6% amino acids and 15% dextrose and 400 kilo calories of lipids , total volume is 1.6 liters and it is to be administered over 20 hours . in addition to the above , she has the following additives : 20 mm/liter of potassium phosphate , 30.8 meq per liter of potassium chloride , 30 meq per liter of sodium chloride , 8 meq per liter of magnesium sulfate , 94 ng per liter of calcium , 10 ml per day of multivitamins , 10 mg of vitamin k every monday , 1 ml per day of trace elements , and 22 units of regular insulin . therefore , her total potassium is 60 meq per liter , total sodium is 30 , and total phosphate is 20 . ms. rule is to follow-up with dr. chelkjescchalsere , who can be reached at 148-701-5440 . dictated by : shasqualena r. rule , m.d. jw91 attending : sa d. jescwierst , m.d. aw64 ab668/0455 batch : 1433 index no. odprj04ekw d : 07/26/96 t : 07/26/96 cc : 1. hematology / oncology"}

illness : this 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least november 1993 , while he was living in aersing rocuch sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea . apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . he came to this country in late december 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up . he had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea . he became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness . past medical history : significant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an italian variation of digoxin , and amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ace inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler . other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol . he also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously . physical examination : he was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 . he had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . there were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . he had no cardiac murmur . his abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . the neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . laboratory data : included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos

scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest x-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . there was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . an electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . he did spike a fever and began ancef and gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . he also tried amicar and continued on low dose prednisone . his headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea . there was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia . transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen . amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently . a bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his cmml to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous cystosine arabinoside and 6-thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions . he was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on allopurinol . the renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his gentamicin . the family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection . he was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose morphine drip which made him much more comfortable . they agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low

myocardial infarction x two in 1984 and 1987 ( receiving tissue plasminogen activator in 1988 ) and subsequently was admitted to an outside hospital in 1992 with symptoms of congestive heart failure . he was admitted to the utal health in 12/92 for unstable angina and symptoms of congestive heart failure . he was hypotensive and intubated at that time and was subsequently stabilized . cardiac catheterization at that time revealed 50% to 70% left main , 50% to 70% proximal left anterior descending , 70% to 80% mid-left anterior descending , 100% proximal left circumflex , and proximal and distal 50% right coronary artery lesions . an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 25% . he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x three by dr. kennedy with left internal mammary artery toleft anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery , saphenous vein graft to om of the left circumflex . the vein grafts were considered to be very close and of poor quality . in the intervening period , he has had atrial fibrillation as his baseline rhythm which has been treated with procainamide . he has had numerous interval admissions to shoreale medical health for congestive heart failure of an increasing pattern in 03/93 and 08/94 and then every three weeks since the beginning of the year . he has had three-pillow orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and

{"id": 212, "label": 0, "text": "principal diagnosis : (1) stage iiic ovarian carcinoma . secondary diagnoses : (1) right lower lobe pneumonia . (2) failure to thrive ; (3) obstructive uropathy . identifying data and chief complaint : mrs. saujule t. neathe is a 73 year old gravida 6 para 4 abortions 2 with a background history of stage iiic papillary serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary who presents on 5/30/94 for failure to thrive , right lower lobe pneumonia and obstructive uropathy . history of present illness : the patient was diagnosed with ovarian carcinoma in the summer of 1992 when she presented with abdominal distention . at that time she was taken to the operating room and an ileostomy and colectomy performed . the admission was complicated by the development of a right calf deep venous thrombosis on postoperative day four . the patient was referred then to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital where she underwent thrombectomy . one month later the patient was readmitted to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital for definitive debulking including total abdominal hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy , omentectomy , splenectomy and ileostomy take-down by dr. slaineaee chabechird . thereafter she underwent line 1 chemotherapy with cis platinum , vp16 which she received six cycles and which was completed in march of 1993 . this course of chemotherapy was complicated only by persistent diarrhea and some nausea and vomiting . on 4/28/94 the patient developed a left femoral deep venous thrombosis requiring admission for anticoagulation . an abdominopelvic computerized tomography scan during that admission showed recurrent disease in the pelvis with bilateral hydronephrosis . bilateral ureteric stents were placed prior to discharge . two days following discharge , however , the patient was admitted to sephsandpot center because of a decreased urinary output and persistent nausea and vomiting and anorexia . she was maintained on intravenous fluids and received a transfusion of prilosec which helped her urinary obstruction . on this regimen she showed good improvement and was discharge home . she was then seen on 5/30/94 at fairm of ijordcompmac hospital for a routine chemotherapy but complained of decreased urinary output , nausea and vomiting and poor appetite and was therefore admitted . past medical history : is as detailed above . past surgical history : she is also status post appendectomy in 1944 and dilation and curettage in 1945 . allergies : she is allergic to shellfish . drug allergies : she has no known drug allergies . medications on admission : include coumadin 2.5 mg. p.o. q.h.s. , omeprazole 20 mg. p.o. q.d. , m.v.i. one tablet p.o. q.d. , ferrous sulfate 325 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , ativan .5 mg. p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. for sleep and tylenol no. 3 one to two tablets p.o. 4 hourly for pain . physical examination : ( on admission ) showed the patient to be low-grade febrile with temperature of 99.6 , vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 104/68 and a pulse of 92 , respiratory rate 16 . she was noted to be a thin , cachectic woman in no apparent distress . head and neck examination remarkable only for extreme dry mucous membranes consistent with dehydration . she had slightly icteric sclera , no adenopathy or thyromegaly . lungs examination was unremarkable with no focal pathology , breasts were within normal limits . heart : regular rate and rhythm , no evidence of evidence , cardiac failure or endocarditis . abdomen : showed well healed midline scar , non-distended , non-tender , bowel sounds were good , multiple small nodules were palpated subcutaneously in the upper abdomen which was non-tender , there was no costovertebral angle tenderness . pelvic and rectal examinations confirmed recurrence of tumor mass in the pelvis . the patient was occult blood negative . extremities : showed no evidence of acute deep venous thrombosis . however , left leg had two plus pitting edema to the knee whereas the right leg had minimal edema . laboratory data : ( on admission ) showed sodium 119 , potassium 9.8 ( the specimen was hemolyzed ) bun and creatinine of 26 and 2.3 respectively , glucose 104 , alt was 13 , total bilirubin .5 , alkaline phosphatase 62 , white blood cell count was 17.7 , hematocrit 26.7 , platelet count 223,000 , prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were 22.1 and 37 respectively . i and r was 5.2. urinalysis showed no white blood cells and few bacteria . chest x-ray from 5/18/94 was within normal limits . in summary : the patient was assessed as a 72 year old woman with a background of stage iiic ovarian carcinoma and documented local recurrence who presents for line 2 of cycle 1 chemotherapy with adriamycin , ifex and mesna . she also has a low-grade fever of unknown etiology , has a background history of deep venous thrombosis and is therefore currently on anticoagulation and she shows evidence of dehydration and failure to thrive . it was decided at that time to hold off with the chemotherapy . hospital course : the patient was therefore admitted to the gyn / oncology service under the care of dr. chabechird . laboratory tests were repeated in view of some of the above abnormalities and was remarkable for sodium 138 , potassium 4.0 , bun and creatinine remained elevated at 36 and 2.8 respectively . urinalysis showed 10-20 white blood cells . in view of the nausea and vomiting a nasogastric tube was placed to which the patient some relief . repeat chest x-ray showed evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia . renal ultrasound was performed which showed moderate right and severe left hydronephrosis , bilateral ureteric stents were visualized . dr. ryna r. jescdrig from the urology service was consulted in view of the above findings . he requested a lasix renal nuclear medicine scan which showed high-grade obstruction of both kidneys , left greater than right and minimal clearance with lasix . neither kidney appeared to be completely obstructed . in view of these results with the elevated white blood count , elevated creatinine , dr. jescdrig felt that the patient was inadequately stented . as a result she was taken back to the operating room on 6/2/94 and under cystoscopy the old stents were removed and new larger stents were placed . the patient was started on ampicillin and gentamicin for urinary tract infection which ultimately grew out escherichia coli sensitive to the above antibiotics and for right lower lobe pneumonia on x-ray . she was started on nebulizers around-the-clock and chest physical therapy . sputum culture was sent but failed to identify an infective organism . on the above regimen the patient showed marked improvement . her urinary output remained good at 80-100 ccs. per hour . however , her bun and creatinine remained elevated . on 6/5/94 they were 21 and 2.2 respectively . her coumadin anticoagulation was adjusted to give a prothrombin time between 16 and 18 and an i and r of 2.5-3 . on june 5 , 1994 it was decided that mrs. neathe was not stable enough with a line 2 cycle i chemotherapy with ifex , adriamycin and mesna . she was therefore well hydrated and was started on her chemotherapy . in view of her kidney damage it was suggested to change her intravenous antibiotics from ancef and gentamicin to ancef and ciprofloxacin which she tolerated well . on 6/7/94 the patient was found to be mildly confused with persistent nausea and malaise . urinary electrolytes were noted to be within normal limits but her confusion persisted . a neuro-oncology consult was sought which felt this was probably secondary to ifex intoxication and her chemotherapy was stopped . an electroencephalogram was requested and was negative . no computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging study of the head was performed . she continued to have persistent nausea and vomiting with large amount of drainage through the nasogastric tube between 1200 and 1500 ccs. for 24 hours . off her ifex the patient 's sensorium slowly cleared but the nausea and vomiting persisted . for this reason a barium study was performed on 6/12/94 which showed a fixed stricture at the anastomosis of the descending colon with the rectum . the mucosa appeared to be preserved . in addition there was some narrowing in the mid portion of the descending colon . the patient 's white blood count which had been followed carefully began to drop precipitously on 6/11/94 and nadired down to 0.7 on 6/12/94 . the patient was placed on neutropenic precautions , her intravenous antibiotics were continued . her sensorium had cleared . because of persistent nausea and vomiting on june 13 , 1994 a kub and upright was requested which showed large amounts of retained barium confirming a rectosigmoid stricture approximately one centimeter in diameter . the patient 's white blood count persisted in the region of .5 to .6 with an anc of 60 for the next two to three days . in addition her platelets began to drop and reach a level on 6/13/94 . she was maintained on intravenous antibiotics and gcsf therapy was started because of the profound neutropenia . despite the low platelets the patient showed no evidence of active bleeding and was not transfused . a gastrograffin upper gastrointestinal was attempted on 6/14/94 but was unsuccessful due to nausea and vomiting . on conservative therapy the patient 's nausea and vomiting has slowly subsided . a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( peg ) tube was placed on june 18 , 1994 which has helped to decompress the stomach and prevent nausea and vomiting . on 6/17/94 in view of a drop in hematocrit to 25 , the patient was transfused three units of packed red blood cells , white count however had increased to 8.5 and her platelets were on their way up , count was 74,000 . and she was not given platelets in addition . throughout this period the patient 's pain remained well controlled on patient controlled analgesia . after much discussion with the family and social services it was decided

historian given his difficulty speaking and inability to write from his parkinson 's disease . his wife noted him to be restless on the day of admission , felt warm , temperature to 102.5 . they went to a local hospital where he was found to have a temperature of 102.4 and blood cultures were done and he was transferred to ph university of medical center for admission . he was recently started on a texas catheter for urinary incontinence at home . he has no symptoms of shortness of breath , cough , diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , choking on food , no new medications . past medical history : as above . medications ; on admission were eldepryl , artane , prilodol , sinemet and opuputine . allergies : he had no known drug allergies . hospital course and treatment : the patient was admitted and started on ampingent intravenously . there was a question of aspiration pneumonia so he was switched from ampicillin pen-g to aspiration pneumonia . he was continued on his parkinson 's medications . a head ct was scheduled to rule out interval increase in subdurals . head ct results show full bilateral acute hemorrhage in his subdural hematomas , now with slight midline shift . dr. factor agreed he would review the cts and follow the patient while in house . he was seen by urology , who suggested to leave the catheter in for now in the setting of doubt ms . he was seen by neuro , who felt that the subdural hemorrhages should be followed and treated conservatively as well as precautions for fall and no further intervention was warranted given risk of re-bleed which is quite high with his atrophic changes . the patient 's mental status improved greatly after the onset of intravenous antibiotics , doing much better , was much more awake and alert and the plan was to possibly send him home on po antibiotics and full arnsperni health services . bedside swallow test was done which showed him to have some aspiration . he did have some recurrent fevers and his intravenous antibiotic were continued . thus , he was considered ready for discharge . he again became much more somnolent , there was a question whether he had re-aspirated . he again was becoming increasing febrile and somnolent while the patient was awaiting a chest x-ray and further evaluation . he was switched over the clinda and gentamicin for his aspiration pneumonia and again his mental status improved . on 8/10/97 , the patient became unresponsive and apneic . brachial consult was obtained and the patient was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit . he was found to be profoundly hypoxic with sats down to 60% on 100% facemask . he was hypotensive into the 80s . an electrocardiogram showed evolving inferior q wave with increased st segment and left anterior st depressions . rv leads were negative for st elevation . a chest x-ray showed marked congestive heart failure with increased heart size . a portable echo showed no pericardial effusion and his left ventricle was severely diffusely hypokinetic with septal dyskinesis . anterior and inferior akinesis , apical akinesis to the posterior lateral wall moved slightly . he had about 20% mild mitral regurgitation . the right ventricle was markedly dilated with a kinetic free wall and very decreased function in a marked incomplete closure of the tricuspid valve with wide open tricuspid regurgitation . he was transferred to the intensive care unit for his acute myocardial infarction with very likely multi-vessel disease with concominent left anterior descending severe stenosis or likely left anterior descending with collateral circulation from that occluded right coronary artery . the patient was also evaluated by neurosurgery , given the difficult situation , the patient was not a candidate for streptokinase or tpa given his chronic subdurals with a recent new bleed . he was evaluated by neurosurgery , who felt that if heparin could be avoided , that would be best . he was treated conservatively with intubation , control of heart rate and on dobutamine for pressure support . he was diuresed with lasix and diuril and was oxygenating fairly well while intubated . he surprisingly made it through the next 24 hours . he was dynamically stable on his dobutamine with improved oxygenation . the patient continued fairly stable while intubated . two days after the myocardial infarction he continued with stable blood pressure on a very small amount of dobutamine . he had diuresed very well with good oxygenation . his neurostatus was indeterminate given his sedation on the ventilatory . discussions with the family were ongoing regarding do not resuscitate and long term plan given his comorbidities . they were waiting appropriately for some information from the repeat echo after his myocardial infarction . an echo showed that there was not much improvement in cardiac function , both right or left ventriculus . they did at that time decide to make him do not resuscitate , but were interested in continuing supportive care to see how much he would bounce back . the repeat echo showed no improvement in left ventricle or right ventricle function with marked akinesis of many walls . the lack of meaningful recovery was much less likely . discussions were had with the family regarding withdrawal of ventilator support , which they very appropriately decided on given the low possibility of any meaningful recovery . he was extubated successfully and was breathing comfortably on his own . the patient was transferred back to the medical floor in stable , but very guarded condition . no further blood draws were done . the patient was made comfortable on a low dose of intravenous morphine with sectioning to prevent further aspiration . comfort measures continued until the day 8/19/97 , where mr. koteleebdils was found to be pulseless , without respirations . he was declared dead at 7:15 a.m. on 8/19/97 . the family and the attending physician were notified . laure mediate , m.d. tr : lw dd : 10/22/97 td : 10/27/97 10:35 a cc : laure t mediate , m.d."}

queszucenove tadl at cochusetts medical center . he presents with increasing chest pain and shortness of breath . he has a long history of coronary artery disease and has a two prior coronary bypass surgeries . his first coronary bypass surgery was on 5/7/1985 by dr. riez . he had lima to the lad and vein graft to the diagonal and then a snake fashion two circumflexes and to the acute marginal branch of the right coronary artery . he presented with angina and had an occluded lad and severe circumflex and right coronary disease . he had normal left ventricular function . he did well , but had recurrent angina by 1999 and cardiac catheterization in march of 2000 showed normal left ventricular function with a native nondominant right coronary artery having a 95% stenosis and the vein graft to this vessel was occluded . the left main was normal . the lad was also occluded . the circumflex was patent , although there was disease of the obtuse marginal branches . the lima to the lad was patent , but there was downstream 70% lesions at the apical portion of the lad . the snake graft was open to the diagonal and to the first obtuse marginal branch , but was occluded to the second portion of this vessel . for this reason , he had a second bypass operation on 5/5/2000 by dr. riez . he had a vein graft to the acute marginal of the right coronary artery in snake fashion to the terminal portion of the right coronary artery . he had a vein graft to the diagonal and obtuse marginal one and a vein graft on the lad bypassing the mid lesion . the lima was left from the first surgery . he did have transient atrial fibrillation after surgery . he had chest pain and an abnormal stress test in 2001 and cardiac catheterization at that time on 8/28/2001 showed that all the grafts were patent , but the runoff to the first diagonal for the vein graft was compromised and he had a 2.5 x 15 mm s660 stent placed at the ostium of the diagonal branch . he did have recurrent episodes of pain and his last stress test on 1/17/2005 showed that he could exercise for 9 minutes and then reached a peak heart rate of 99 on medication and a blood pressure of 150/100 , but he had shortness of breath and a posterolateral defect with some filling . he therefore was referred for cardiac catheterization . past medical history : his past medical history includes hypertension , elevated cholesterol , and a herniated disc . he also has had cataract repairs . family history : he has a strong family history with a father and an uncle having had coronary disease at a young age . social history : his social history is that he lives in lotyvall 1 , quera , minnesota with his wife second . he has four children . he is present in a capefrecam luhthousy . he does not drink and does not smoke . allergies : he is allergic to contrast dye having had hypotension and is premedicated with steroids . physical examination : on exam , he is 5 feet , 9 inches , and 160 pounds . his blood pressure is 130/75 . his pulse is 50 and regular . his neck veins are not distended . his head and neck exam is normal . his lungs are clear . his cardiac exam shows no murmurs or gallops . his abdomen is benign . his peripheral pulses are intact . his neurologic exam was nonfocal . he is fully oriented . laboratory data on admission : includes an electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with right bundle-branch block . hematocrit 43% , potassium 4.3 , and creatinine of 1.0 . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the cardiac cath laboratory . there , the native right coronary artery was occluded and the vein graft to the rv marginal and the right-sided pda was patent . the lad was occluded and the lima to the proximal lad was patent , but there was also a jump graft that went from the mid to the distal segment of the lad and that was also patent . the vein graft to the diagonal and circumflex was also patent and the ostial diagonal stent was also patent . the culprit territory was the distal left-sided pda coming off the circumflex and this had an 85% stenosis . this was a very small vessel and this was a tortuous segment and a long lesion . it was felt that this single lesion given the open distal right territory was not worth stenting and it was felt that he should be managed medically . left ventriculography showed inferior hypokinesis and anterolateral hypokinesis with preserved left ventricular function . he tolerated the procedure well . he was monitored for the day . he ambulated without difficulty . he was discharged home and will be followed closely by his physicians at sko gerb timp valley health and at middso memorial hospital 's . he will remain on beta blockers , ace inhibitors , statins , aspirin and plavix indefinitely .

felt after full work up with a negative pa gram , plus / minus vq , negative echocardiogram , negative sero-ck 's and no evolving electrocardiogram that the patient had pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic lung disease . it was felt that the patient likely had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of greater severity and duration than initially suspected and by history from the patient , in particular supported by her chronic co2 retention on subsequent arterial blood gases . the patient was maintained on treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation , including steroid taper and nebs as well as antibiotic coverage . repeat chest x-ray subsequently showed hyperinflation consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , no signs of pneumonia or pulmonary edema , bilateral blunting of the costophrenic angles , consistent with pleural thickening , and / or small bilateral pleural effusions , consistent with right upper quadrant ultrasound . pulmonary service was consulted . they recommendations included smoking cessation , recommendation for o2 use if flying back home to missouri , continuing antibiotics for a 14 days course , albuterol , atrovent mdi 's and follow-up of pleural effusions with one month repeat chest x-ray . it was subsequently arranged for the patient to transfer back to balau for care there with a pulmonologist as well as her primary-care physician . the patient was discharged in good state of health , ambulating . sats with and without o2 were above 88% . a complete copy of the medical chart was sent with the

hospital showed no abscess and left renal atrophy with multiple cysts . the electroencephalogram showed left greater than right frontotemporal slowing throughout the tracing . head ct scan on 07/30/2002 showed prominent ventricles , cortical atrophy , and suggested infarct in the left thalamus , left insular cortex , and decreased attenuation in the right frontal lobe . as noted , laboratory data at the outside hospital included a negative clostridium difficile , a weakly positive d-dimer , a weakly positive lupus anticoagulant , and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 48 . hospital course : the patient 's presentation was a very confusing and complicated one with differential diagnosis including a neurodegenerative process such as creutzfeldt-jakob disease , a dementia such as alzheimer 's of a more rapidly progressing nature , and other infectious etiologies such as urinary tract infection or another fever source . work up included from a neurologic perspective brain mri , brain eeg , lumbar puncture . in concert with the neurology service , who followed the patient with us , we ordered an eeg and mri with susceptibilities and dwi . an lumbar puncture was performed , in which we measured the opening pressure as unremarkable at 14.5 cm . in addition , per neurology recommendations , we sent cerebrospinal fluid for gram stain , bacterial culture , fungal cultures , acid-fast bacilli , __________ antigen , 14-3-3 protein for creutzfeldt-jakob disease , cytology , and , in addition , ordered eegs , mris , antithyroglobulin antibody , antithyroid peroxidase antibody , tsh , ammonia , methyl malonic acid , and , in addition , considered neoplastic tests from the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid including anti-ma , anti-ta , anti-cv2 , anti-hu , anti-yo antibodies . in addition , from a renal perspective , the patient was placed on a tuesday , thursday , saturday dialysis schedule . for her hypertension , shewas given lisinopril . for her fen , the patient was able to take po 's and , per speech and swallow consult , was permitted to take po 's with one to one supervision . for prophylaxis , the patient was on subcutaneous heparin and nexium . from an infectious disease perspective , the patient remained afebrile and , despite a transient bump in her white blood cell count over the weekend of 08/10 through 08/12/2002 , has had a white blood cell count come back to normal range of 12.0 . no obvious source of infection was found , with negative cultures from blood , urine , sputum , the peritoneal fluid , and cerebrospinal fluid . excellent suggestions from dr. pa of the renal service included repeating anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant , given the patient 's weakly positive lupus anticoagulant in the past and the fact that this could be associated with severe and rapid cognitive decline that was observed in this patient . however , these antibodies were both within normal limits . the patient 's mental status gradually began to improve during the course ofthe weekend from 08/10 through 08/12 and was markedly improved on 08/13/2002 , compared with the day of admission . however , the patient remains not oriented to time or to place , although she is now able to answer questions and actually carry on simple conversations appropriately . the nature of her cognitive decline and change in mental status is still unclear , with most typical and less typical causes of reversible change in mental status having been ruled out and no obvious sources of infection from blood , csf , sputum , urine , or peritoneal fluid . on the abdominal ct scan , there was a question of an ovarian cystic mass that raised the possibility of ovarian cancer . ca-125 levels were within normal limits . we entertained the possibility of doing a pelvic ultrasound to further characterize this lesion . we will discuss the case further with the neurology service , who will evaluate the case more carefully tomorrow with their attending . pending no further suggestions on their part , we have completed the metabolic work up for reversible causes of dementia and will likely discharge the patient to return to the termarimed pending no further suggestions from neurology or other consultants . lenni e. hodgkin , m.d. , ph.d dictating for : electronically signed lenni e. hodgkin , m.d. , ph.d 08/20/2002 07:46

replacement with homograft with omentopexy . associated procedures : 09/02/98 sternal debridement . bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flap . right superiorly based rectus abdominis flap . primary closure of wound . history and reason for hospitalization : the patient is a 79 year old gentleman with a history of an ascending aortic graft replacement in 1991 for aortic dissection . at that time the patient 's hospital course was complicated by a sternal wound infection requiring a sternal debridement and subsequent abdominal flap . the patient was then continued by report on dicloxacillin for approximately one year following that reconstructive operation . the patient apparently did well until june 1998 when he noted a bulge in his sternal area . a ruptured aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm at the junction of the graft and arch was diagnosed and this was subsequently repaired . the patient then had recurrent bleeding two weeks later which was once again repaired . however the same problem recurred for a third time and a computer tomogram scan at an outside hospital showed an anterior hematoma . by report the patient was at that time told that there was no more that could be done for him and was then apparently placed on comfort measures and pain control at the outside hospital . however the patient was then subsequently transferred to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital upon request of the family on 8/24/98 for further evaluation and possible intervention . the patient was evaluated by dr. rhalt of dentvailr. medical center . as the patient 's early evaluation the patient underwent an aortogram which showed an ascending aortic graft with bulging flaps and a pseudoaneurysm at the anastomosis of the graft and arch just below the great vessels . there was no evidence for a definite leak but there was evidence for gas bubbles in the anterior posterior distal ends of the grafts consistent with an infectious process . at the same time the patient was seen in consultation by the infectious disease service who upon culturing the patient 's sternal drainage switched the patient from intravenous unasyn to levofloxacin for what appeared to be citrobacter and diphtheroids in the wound cultures . subsequent to starting this antibiotic regimen the patient 's wound drainage appeared to subside . given all the findings on the aortogram and the subsequent chest computer tomogram scan it was discovered that the patient 's only real surgical option for cure was a risky operation that involved removal and replacement of the aortic graft probably with homograft and long term antibiotic coverage as well as a plastic surgical reconstructive procedure . the patient understood the risks and potential benefits of the procedure and was willing to proceed . the patient otherwise complained of no angina , no shortness of breath , no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no edema , no palpitations or symptoms of syncope . he did report a 20 lbs weight loss over the last several months . past medical history : 1. thoracic aneurysm repair . 2. hypertension . 3. status post hernia repair . medications on admission : 1. lopressor 100 mg po three times a day . 2. captopril 75 mg po three times a day . 3. prilosec 20 mg po per day . 4. hydralazine 12.5 mg four times per day . 5. reglan 10 mg po three times a day . allergies : no known drug allergies . family history : noncontributory . social history : the patient was married and denied any tobacco or alcohol use . physical examination : the patient was afebrile , vital signs were stable . head , eyes , ears , nose and throat exam : negative . neck was supple . there was no jugular venous distention . 2+ carotids without bruits . cardiovascular exam : regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 diastolic ___ and a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur . his lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without any evidence for crackles . extremities : the patient had 2+ femoral pulses and 1+ pedal pulses . laboratory and radiologic data : sodium 137 , potassium 4.0 , blood urea nitrogen 16 , creatinine .9 , white blood cell count 4.9 , hematocrit 29.7 , platelet count 207 . the patient 's preoperative chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis . physical examination : the patient 's sternal incision had a superior edge that was dehisced with evidence for stay sutures and some superficial closure sutures exposed . hospital course : the patient was initially admitted to the cardiac surgical service under dr. rhalt . the patient was admitted to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit given the patient 's precarious condition . over the next several hospital days the patient underwent aortogram as well as chest computer tomogram as outlined earlier . the patient was also seen in consultation by the infectious disease service as well as the cardiology service who assisted in managing the patient 's intermittent hypertension . the patient was also seen preoperatively in consultation by the plastic surgical service for potential sternal reconstruction . after lengthy discussions with the patient and the patient 's family as well as the various consultant services it was decided that the patient was a viable candidate for aortic root replacement procedure using homograft . this was obtained on 08/30/98 by dr. niste rhalt of the cardiac surgical service . the patient was then subsequently taken to the operating room on 08/31/98 with the preoperative diagnosis of ascending aortic graft infection . the procedure performed was homograft replacement of the ascending aorta with omentopexy and an open chest . the aortic perfusions were via the femoral artery with venous return by the femoral vein . the cardiopulmonary bypass time was one hour and 49 minutes . the graft used was a homograft . the patient tolerated the procedure fairly well and was transferred intubated to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit with his chest open . the immediate postoperative plans were for a short intensive care unit stay and subsequent plastic surgical reconstruction of the patient 's sternum . the patient was transferred to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit in stable condition . there he continued to be hemodynamically stable . of note , intraoperatively multiple tissue cultures had been sent . in the intensive care unit the patient was kept intubated and sedated until 09/02/98 which was postoperative day no. 1 following the homograft replacement . on that day the plastic surgical service performed further sternal debridement and subsequent reconstruction using bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flaps and right superiorly rectus abdominis flap to cover the patient 's sternal wound with subsequent primary closure of that wound . the patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications . a number of indwelling closed suction drains were left in place so as to drain the bed underneath the muscle flaps . the patient was then transferred back to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit in stable condition . at this point the patient continued to followed by infectious disease service and continued to be on intravenous antibiotics which included vancomycin and levofloxacin . the operating room cultures at that point were positive for crinobactermium with sputum cultures being sensitive for yeast and gram positive cocci in clusters . over the next postoperative day the patient was awakened and weaned to extubate without significant difficulties . the patient 's subsequent postoperative course was characterized by persistent hypertension which required a significant amount of antihypertensives including lopressor 100 mg po three times a day , captopril 100 mg po three times a day , as well as procardia . the patient otherwise continued to do well and was becoming more oriented as time went on and as his blood pressure was brought under control . subsequently on postoperative day no. 8 in the intensive care unit the patient was felt to be ready for transfer to the cardiac surgical inpatient service . the patient continued to be followed by the infectious disease service who felt that the patient 's jackson pratt drains needed to stay in as there was still some significant drainage from them . as per the infectious disease service the patient was continued on levofloxacin , vancomycin as antibiotic coverage . however on 09/08/98 the infectious disease service was made aware that the patient 's intraoperative cultures had also grown out mycoplasma humilius . given this finding it was felt that the patient would certainly need long term intravenous antibiotics to include at least six weeks of vancomycin and then subsequent levofloxacin for the citrobacter and mycoplasma as well . the patient was scheduled for peripherally inserted central catheter line placement knowing that he was going to need long term intravenous antibiotics . this was placed on postoperative day no. 9 without any difficulty . at the same time the patient continued to be stable on his antihypertensive regimen . he was becoming more mobile and was taking a high protein high calories diet which he tolerated well . he continued to be afebrile and otherwise very stable . on postoperative day no. 12 the patient was noted to have fallen and subsequently dislocating the pip joint of his left middle finger . subsequent hand x-rays obtained showed no evidence of fracture but the patient was seen in consultation by the plastic surgery hand service . the patient will benefit from splinting of his finger while the swelling subsided and subsequent early mobilization to prevent any rigidity in that joint . the patient was also seen subsequently in consultation by the plastic surgical service who discontinued a number of the patient 's indwelling drains but they felt that others needed to stay while the patient was sent to rehabilitation . these drains will then be subsequently taken out by dr. general upon his followup with the patient . prior to discharge the patient also underwent an audiogram as a baseline hearing test while the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics . the patient otherwise continued to be hemodynamically stable making good progress . as a matter of fact the patient made remarkable progress given the severity of his disease condition prior to the operation . the patient 's condition continued to be improved . given this finding the patient was therefore felt to be ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on 09/13/1998 . in consultation with the infectious disease service the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics . condition on discharge : good . discharge instructions : diet : high calorie , high protein . the patient 's treatment will include typical peripherally inserted central catheter line care with frequent wound checks . the patient prior to discharge was fitted with an orthoplast finger splint as manufactured by occupational therapy services fairm of ijordcompmac hospital . the patient was also instructed in range of motion exercises for the left middle finger . the patient on discharge is to have twice weekly vancomycin peak and trough levels while he continues on long term vancomycin therapy . the patient was instructed to return to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital if he developed any signs of wound infection such a erythema , drainage , or increasing incisional pain . the patient was instructed to be vigilant for any fevers or chills . medications on discharge : 1. vancomycin 750 mg intravenous q 18h. 2. levofloxacin 500 mg po per day . 3. prilosec 20 mg po per day . 4. captopril 100 mg po three times a day . 5. lopressor 100 mg po three times a day . 6. albuterol nebulizers q6h as needed . 7. atrovent nebulizers q6h as needed . 8. lasix 20 mg po per day . 9. kay-ciel 20 meq po per day . followup : the patient was instructed that he needed to followup with dr. rhalt by calling his office for appointment at 763-6361 subsequent to his discharge to his rehabilitation facility in oaksale lavalle . the patient was also instructed to followup with dr. both of the cardiology service fairm of ijordcompmac hospital following his discharge so that his antihypertension medications could be appropriately adjusted . the patient will also be seen in followup by dr. chpo e. enla general of the plastic surgery service fairm of ijordcompmac hospital so that his indwelling jackson pratt drains be appropriately management and if needed be discontinued by him . the patient will also be followed by the infectious disease service so as to ascertain the exact length and course of his antibiotic therapy . the patient was instructed to followup with dr. naco mesprhalt of the infectious disease service by calling her office for an appointment at 094-902-2879 to be seen in approximately four weeks following the patient 's discharge . dr. dau 's recommendation is that the patient is to stay on vancomycin and levofloxacin for approximately six weeks following discharge and then subsequently on antibiotic regimen for chronic suppression . ryna dau , m.d. dictating for : niste ma rhalt , m.d. tr : oq dd : 09/13/1998 td : 09/13/1998 7:18 a cc : kend n both , m.d.

bronchiectasis . adverse drug reactions : none . clinical infections : none . principal procedure : cardiac catheterization . associated procedures : vq scan , lower extremities noninvasive doppler studies and overnight oximetry saturation monitoring . history of present illness : mr. bridge is an 81-year-old man with a history of restrictive and obstructive lung disease , dilated cardiomyopathy , inferior myocardial infarction , and anterior mediastinal masses admitted with acute onset of pulmonary edema . in the setting of inadvertently decreasing lasix from 80 mg. po 40 mg. a day mr. bridge had sudden onset dyspnea after approximate day and a half prodrome culminating in severe dyspnea . upon arrival in the emergency room mr. bridge 's saturations were in the mid 80s and he was promptly rendered more comfortable with high flow oxygen , morphine , and nitrates and intravenous lasix . chest x-ray was relatively unrevealing for interstitial or alveolar edema and with clinical improvement ensued with the immediate therapy in the emergency room as noted . the patient denied angina , syncope , preceding worsening orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations , chest pain , hematemesis or melena . past medical history : is notable for an inferior myocardial infarction , restrictive and obstructive lung disease with an fev1 of .9 and fvc of 1.34 and a moderate at best response to bronchodilators , and a negative sestamibi scan in december , 1999 apart from a severe fixed inferolateral defect , systolic dysfunction with recent echocardiography revealing an lvid of 62 mm. and ejection fraction of 28 percent , moderate mitral regurgitation and mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 33 and a mean gradient of 19 and a valve area of 1.4 cm. squared . in addition , mr. bridge has an anterior mediastinal mass 2x2x1.7 cm. by recent computerized tomography scan without surrounding or adjacent adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease apart from bronchiectasis . his cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ana , negative spep , upep and benz-jones proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative . the patient lives on ewi with his wife . he is a non-smoker and drinks rare alcohol . physical examination : the patient was a very pleasant man who appeared his stated age . blood pressure was 155/60 , heart rate 70 with occasional premature ventricular contractions , respirations 14 . mr. bridge was dyspneic speaking in short sentences initially on high flow oxygen . jugular venous pressure was 8 with a brisk inspiratory descent . there was no thyromegaly . carotids were 2+ . breath sounds were decreased at the bases only with distant heart sounds and a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur consistent with aortic stenosis with gallavardin like radiation to the apex . abdomen : soft , nontender with hepatosplenomegaly , or hepatojugular reflex , bruits or pulsations . there was no rash and no edema and the neurological examination was non-focal . laboratory data : notable for a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.6 , bun 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 104 , hematocrit 42 , white count 8.7 , platelet count 235 and a pt of 12.9 seconds . the urinalysis was negative . the troponin i was less than .4 and the creatine kinase was 114 . chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases . the electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations . after a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent . prior to catheterization a vq scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for pe with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung . subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and d-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent . it was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto . coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries . after a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute . based upon these findings it was felt that mr. bridge most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state . in hospital he was seen by both speech therapy , physical therapy , and the uspend harmemewood medical center congestive heart failure nurse practitioner program . his isordil was increased in hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 . future adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures . at a goal weight of 142 pounds , mr. bridge 's filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home . the patient will be followed by dr. fraction within a week of discharge and

{"id": 272, "label": 2, "text": "history of present illness : this is a 64 year old patient initially admitted to dr. riode area status post an aorto bifemoral bypass in 01/98 with an end to end proximal and to the common femoral bilaterally . the patient has had recurrent claudication for the last five months and has developed lesions on the first toe which is apparently similar to aparonychia . he had an angiogram which shows a severe stenosis in the right distal area with a thrombosing right limb of an aorto femoral graft . he also has an irregular lesion at the profunda femoris origin and with the superficial femoral occluded bilaterally . he was therefore admitted to the hospital for an ileofemoral bypass . the patient unfortunately continues to smoke and has greater than a 50 pack year history of smoking and by notes of dr. area 's office , this has been discussed at length with him and the implications of the smoking . he has a history of a deep vein thrombosis and a question of a pulmonary embolism with what is thought to be a non fully documented hypercoagulable state . he had a left superficial femoral artery interposition graft around 1990 which is non functioning at the present time , most of which was done at the alconspore woocawo medical center . allergies : the patient has no known drug allergies . medications on admission : his medications on admission include coumadin and levofloxacin . his coumadin has been held for two days . his claudication is equal bilaterally . physical examination : on physical examination was remarkable for no carotid bruits , a ventral hernia without any masses which was reasonably reducible . his rectal exam was refused at the time of surgery since apparently it was negative at the tocon hospital the previous week . he has a first and fourth toe which had some purulent discharge around the toes with ischemic modeled toes and on the left side there were no lesions in the feet . his pulse exam was a femoral pulse bilaterally , but none distally . laboratory data : his bun and creatinine were within normal limits at 16 and 1.3 and his hematocrit was 44 with a white blood count of 10,000 and 139,000 platelet count . he has ankle brachial indices of .36 bilaterally but with his right toes appearing ischemic with lesions he would most likely not heal these lesions . hospital course : dr. area had asked me to see the patient and after discussing with the patient it was agreed that i would proceed with revascularization of his right leg since he had a angiogram which demonstrated a failing limb of his aortofemoral graft and a tight profundus stenosis . after discussing with the patient , getting his prothrombin time closer to range , he was brought to the operating room where a ileo profunda bypass was performed with an 8 mm . ep to fe under general endotracheal anesthesia . there was copious thrombus in the distal right limb of the aortofemoral graft which also had a thromboendarterectomy performed and excellent inflow was achieved . superficial femoral artery was divided since it was also chronically occluded . there was a significant amount of thrombus at the anastomosis as well which had developed a small aneurysmaltype of dilatation , although there was no dehiscence of the anastomosis . the profunda had been opened beyond the origin stenosis and the bypass was then performed providing and excellent flow to the calf and excellent pulsevolume recordings were obtained with strong upstrokes . it was therefore elected not to proceed with a distal bypass graft to the popliteal arteries which would have been required should this not have worked . the patient postoperatively did quite well . he had continued good post volume recordings and there was no question that with this improved circulation and silvadene dressings to his toes that they actually started to heal in his postoperative course with improved perfusion and capillary refill . his groin incision was healing nicely and he was on heparin , being converted to coumadin . because of the issue relating to his hypercoagulable state , and the need for getting him in range , he was keptin the hospital and not discharged . the orders of his wounds and wound care were clarified and he was transferred to frontera 34 to ensure that this would be performed properly . no cellulitis was present , and the patient had indicated his desire to be discharged . despite loading him on coumadin , his prothrombin time and inr increased slowly and he left the hospital without discharge order or discharge planning on the 18th of december . i had called the patient and discussed with him his care , which he had been then transferring to his local medical doctor for anticoagulation purposes . i explained to the patient that because of his early discharge i would not be able to be responsible for his care but would be happy to see him in theoffice for removal of his sutures and an appointment for that was undertaken . degreg r. uph , m.d. electronically signed a lisswhiti area , m.d. 01/30/2001 04:33 _ tr : yg dd : 01/18/2001 td : 01/22/2001 9:24 pcc : riode

the patient suffered some mild weakness which was attributed to stenosis of the distal right internal carotid artery . this was determined by head ct , head mri , head mra , carotid noninvasive studies , transcranial dopplers . the possibility of a cardiac origin was evaluated by echocardiogram and holter monitor . her echocardiogram curiously showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function , a patent foramen ovale , with a trace right to left shunt , as determined by bubble study , trace mr was present . previous echoes have shown mvp at the ona hospital . her holter showed up to 12 beats of svt , but was otherwise unremarkable . the patient had a normal b12 , negative syphilis serologies and normal thyroid function during this hospitalization . she was anticoagulated with heparin and after several days coumadin was started . her exact coumadin dose is undetermined at this point , however it looks like it will be something around 5 mg a day . her pro time and ptt have normalized at the time of discharge . she needs to be given 5 mg of coumadin tonight , 5/22/92 . in addition heparin should be started to drip on arrival at 400 units an hour . it is discontinued at the time of transport . the patient has received physical therapy and occupational therapy and her recovery is near complete . during evaluation of her neurologic status , it was determined that for several months prior to admission , the patient has been too unsteady to ambulate . on our exam she is found to have a significant amount of ataxia , especially in the midline and the exact cause of this is unknown . there are multiple possible contributions and this is where her need for careful internal medical evaluation has arisen . at the time we were to embark on this evaluation , the patient 's family strongly requested that she be transferred to the sas general hospital . what follows is a summary of her medical problems and their possible relationship to her ataxia . her ataxia is likely due to some cerebellar function , though this is not certain . moreover her mri did not show any discrete cerebellar lesions . our leading theory at this point is that her cerebellar dysfunction relates to perineoplastic syndrome , relating to her history of breast ca . as i mentioned above , her evaluation was limited by her cardiologic status at the time . while mammogram and ca-15.3 and breast exam are all normal , the idea of a perineoplastic syndrome with or without concomitant breast ca has reared its head . two possible markers are anti-hu syndrome and anti-yo antibody . these tests were sent on the 18th and are pending at the time of discharge . the results can be obtained by paging me , do a. joasscchird , m.d. at 834-364-2251 . i will be happy to furnish the results . the patient has a history of mi in 1989 . echocardiogram no longer shows wall motion abnormalities . ekg , when the patient goes out of left bundle branch block transiently shows an anterolateral q/wave inversion . we would like to discontinue her isordil to improve upon some orthostatic hypotension , but we are not certain whether her heart will tolerate this . persantine thallium is scheduled at this time , but is yet to be performed . the patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension x many years . it has been evaluated in the past without success . during her hospitalization , we confirmed the presence of this , even when she was hydrated with saline , to a fractional excretion of sodium of 2% . studies of her autonomic system did not document any dysautonomia . studies of skin galvanic conduction were normal and her rr interval evaluation was not abnormal . this is a chronic problem but may be contributing to her current weakness and inability to walk . florinef is to be considered , however stopping the isordil is one goal . the patient has a history of bronchiectasis from a childhood pneumonia . in addition there is a distant history of m. kansasaii infection . this has been evaluated by dr. screen at sas general hospital and probably relates to her lung xray . ct at the ona hospital in 1989 showed similar findings . a chest ct was to be performed and may be yielding . a ppd was placed and is to be read on saturday , 4 26th . the left volar forearm has the ppd just proximal to the wrist crease and a candida albicans placed just

93-year-old woman who was transferred from daleglo medical center with renal insufficiency . the patient was in her usual state of health until 7/10/98 when she was admitted to the daleglo medical center with a chief complaint of falling and mental status changes . she was initially treated for heart failure and pneumonia and , on the night of admission , she experienced a fever to 104 , acute respiratory distress and required intubation for two days . the patient was noted to have a cpk of 150 with 11.8 percent mb but no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes . she was treated for congestive heart failure and was diuresed and extubated . she was transferred to the floor where initially she did very well but subsequently developed an elevated bun and creatinine and failure to eat . the patient 's granddaughter requested that she be transferred to the ph university of medical center where she had been cared for in the past for her myocardial infarction as well as cerebrovascular disease . past medical history : her past medical history is notable for congestive heart failure with a last ejection fraction noted to be 28 percent in april of 1997 . she also has a history of urinary tract infection . she has a history of diverticulosis with lower gi bleeds . in 01/95 she was admitted with a cerebral vascular accident notable for right facial droop and left-sided weakness . there was marked improvement in these symptoms thereafter , and the patient was discharged on coumadin which was subsequently discontinued . the patient also has a history of myocardial infarction in 1977 and 1987 and underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting x4 in 1987 . she also has a history of polymyalgia rheumatica with a bilateral temporal artery being biopsied and being negative for temporal arteritis . she also has a history of right proximal femur fracture and internal fixation in 1995 . on arrival to the ph university of medical center the patient stated that she had not had a bowel movement for many days and that she had no appetite . however , she denied any chest pain , dyspnea or syncope . physical examination : on physical examination her pulse was 55 . her systolic blood pressure was 110 . she appeared to be very dry with very dry mucosa . her lungs had few rhonchi , no rales . her cardiac exam was irregular but her heart sounds were distant . her abdomen showed active bowel sounds , was nontender and she had no pedal edema . laboratory data : laboratory data was notable for hematocrit of 33.5 , white count of 14.7 , platelet count of 270 . bun 112 , creatinine 2.3 , sodium 142 , potassium 4.2 , co2 23.4 , and chloride 104 . a chest x-ray revealed clear lungs on a portable chest x-ray without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema . a kub showed a large loop of dilated bowel but no free air and a tortuous calcified aorta . an electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of an old inferior myocardial infarction and right bundle branch block . hospital course and treatment : the patient was admitted to goman 25 where she was hydrated for the presumed diagnosis of pre-renal azotemia . a urinalysis was notable for pyuria with 50 to 100 white cells , and the patient was begun on levofloxacin for presumed polymicrobial urinary tract infection . a head ct scan was performed which showed multiple old ischemic infarcts in the right frontal and cerebellar lobes . there was diffuse atrophy and no evidence of recent bleed . the patient was evaluated by the rheumatology service who noted that the patient 's diagnosis was most consistent with rheumatoid arthritis and possibly pmr . the patient had been followed by dr. friednantflirt of the ph university of medical center . at that time she was noted to have undergone bilateral temporal artery biopsies , both of which were negative for temporal arteritis . the recommendation from the rheumatology service was to attempt to decrease her prednisone to 5 mg po q.day with an eye on a change in the severity of her shoulder arthritis symptoms . on the third hospital day the patient developed a sudden change in her mental status while taking pills . she was noted to be arousable and responsive and minimally conversation . however , she was unable to move her right arm or leg . her eyes were deviated to the left and she had a right facial droop . the patient was taken to the emergent cat scan which revealed no acute bleeding and was felt to be a cerebral vascular occlusion . the patient was evaluated by the stroke service , which recommended a lumbar puncture which was performed and did not reveal evidence of meningitis . a cardiac ultrasound was performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 50 percent with wall motion abnormalities in the inferior septal and inferior walls involving the apex . there was trace mitral regurgitation . multiple aortic valve leaflets were thickened without stenosis . there was no evidence of an intraventricular thrombus . the patient was initially treated by increasing her aspirin from 81 mg to 325 mg . she was also continued to be hydrated . her blood pressure medications were held to allow increased cerebral perfusion . after careful discussion with the neurology service , it was felt that the patient was at too great a risk to be started and maintained on anticoagulant therapy and therefore she was treated conservatively . the patient was subsequently evaluated by the speech pathology service , the physical therapy service and the occupational therapy service for evaluation for her recovery from her stroke . her bun and creatinine continued to decrease with hydration and zestril was re-initiated and , as her blood pressure allowed , her isordil was re-initiated and then her zestril was increased to 10 mg po q.day . digoxin was discontinued because of her improved left ventricular ejection fraction . the patient did have a steady decrease in her hematocrit to a minimum of 26.2 and received one unit of packed red blood cells with restoration of her hematocrit over 30 . her ferritin was 83 and there was no evidence of guaiac positive stools . it was elected to defer further evaluation of her anemia at this time . however , if she became more evidently guaiac positive it would be appropriate to evaluate the source of bleeding in her colon and potentially in her esophagus and stomach . nevertheless , the patient was switched from aspirin to plavix 75 mg po q.day in view of her history of lower gi bleeding . major consideration toward the end of the patient 's hospitalization was whether or not she would be able to take adequate po intake to maintain her volume status . initially it was felt that the patient would require gastroscopy . however , with the assistance of the patient 's granddaughter , the patient was able to increase her po intake with a lot of assistance . the patient 's granddaughter felt that it was likely that her po intake would improve when she returned home to the nursing home . i discussed this with the granddaughter and told her that if her po intake was inadequate , that gastrostomy tube would be reasonable in the future and that we would be available to assist in this as it became necessary . the patient was evaluated by the gi service who thought that a peg would be quite feasible and that they would be delighted to do this if it was necessary and the patient and family agreed . nevertheless , we have decided to postpone this issue for now and to see how she does when she returns to the nursing home . the patient will be transferred tomorrow to naplesvillechaelty . i will get in touch with dr. areas and please do not hesitate to contact me if i can provide any additional information . my direct pager is

4/9 and was subsequently transferred to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital for further care . the patient was apparently well until one day prior to admission . his family reports that he had worked that day . he relates using large doses of cocaine and heroin early in the morning on the day of admission . at 3:00 a.m. on the day of admission he was found by the emergency medical technicians \" crawling on all fours \" , confused , and combative outside his home . he gave an equivocal history of fevers and chills on the days prior to admission . bystanders report that he was assaulted about 20 minutes earlier and the nature of the assault was not known . he was taken to the sephsandpot center where he was hypotensive with a blood pressure of 105/85 , tachycardic with a heart rate to 186 , aneuric , hyperthermic , with a temperature to 105 degrees f , and progressively more confused . his chest x-ray was clear . he was treated with dopamine for hypertension and inderal for tachycardia . he received two amps of narcan . he received one gram of ceftriaxone intravenously after blood cultures were drawn . his initial arterial blood gas at the sephsandpot center revealed a p02 of 76 , pc02 14 , and a ph of 7.44 on room air . he was then transferred via med flight to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital . he denied any history of recent travel . toxicology screen at sephsandpot center revealed cocaine and quinine . shortly after his arrival to that hospital he had been intubated for a respiratory rate of 60 . he required medical paralysis for this . he was reported to have a seizure , although the nature of this was unclear , and received valium for this . past medical history : none . past surgical history : he is status post recent left knee surgery , status post left

obtunded white muscular man who was intubated and sedated . the vital signs showed a blood pressure of 69 , pulse 80 , respirations 14 , and temperature 99.8 . there is a contusion over the right eye but no laceration , abrasion of her left shoulder , no flank discoloration , blanching papules over the knees bilaterally without central necrosis . he had multiple tattoos . lymphatic-he had shotty cervical adenopathy . the head , eyes , ears , nose , throat exam was normocephalic , with trauma as described , pupils were 2 mm bilaterally which were minimally reactive , fundi was not seen ,

hemorrhage . the oropharynx was intubated . lungs-clear with good air movement bilaterally . he had scattered wheezes following a 3 liter bolus for hypotension . no effusion or rub was heard . the cardiac exam showed point of maximal impulse was not displaced , regular rate and rhythm with normal s1 , s2 , no s3 or s4 , a grade ii / vi systolic murmur was heard at the left upper sternal border without radiation , likely representing a flow murmur . no peripheral edema was noted . the jugular venous pressure was not assessed secondary to cervical collar being in place . the carotid pulses were brisk bilaterally . the vascular exam showed normal pulses bilaterally without bruits . the abdomen was soft , bowel sounds of normal character , and there was mild percussion tenderness and tenderness to modest palpation in all four quadrants . it was unclear whether this was due to superficial tenderness or abdominal tenderness . he had marked voluntary guarding without rigidity and no masses were felt . the genitourinary exam showed normal penis with normal testicles which were nontender . there was no urethritis , no balinitis , normal prostate , nontender . there was tan guaiac

symmetric . the motor exam-moves all four extremities easily and on command . the sensory exam revealed no focal deficits to limited exam . reflexes were trace in the upper extremities and absent in the knees with downgoing toes bilaterally . laboratory data : on admission the sodium was 144 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 114 , bicarbonate 12.3 , bun 30 , creatinine 4.0 , glucose 89 . the sgot was 994 , ldh 1,888 , alkaline phosphatase 92 , total bilirubin 2.9 and direct bilirubin 11.2 . lactate was 6.3 , acetone negative , ammonia 26 , uric acids 26.9 , albumin 4.0 , globulin 3.0 , amylase 259 , lipase 34 , magnesium 3.5 , phosphorus 1.9 , calcium 9.4. the white blood count was 19.7 with 89% polys , 7% bands , 4% lymphs , with toxic granulations . hematocrit was 45.2 with a platelet count of 132,000 , falling rapidly to 24,000 . the mcv is 88 . the prothrombin time is 27.7 , partial thromboplastin time is greater than 100 . the urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.15 , ph 5.0 , and 4+ albumin , positive occult blood , with 0-5 granular casts and 5-10 rbcs and 3-5 wbcs . the ck was 17,890 with 0.6% mb . the urine sodium was 147 . the serum toxicology was positive for cocaine on admission to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital as well as the sephsandpot center . the electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 85 with a prolonged qt at 0.572 . an i-head ct revealed left sphenoid and left maxillary sinusitis with mild cerebral edema and no focal hemorrhages . the abdominal ct revealed mesenteric adenopathy , normal bowels , hepatosplenomegaly , and ? fatty liver . chest x-ray revealed early interstitial edema . hospital course : the patient was admitted with the diagnosis of cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , shock , hepatic failure , pancreatitis , and thrombocytopenia in the setting of cocaine intoxication . he was accepted at the vo yd burgsygu hospital center intensive care unit and his hospital course will be reviewed by problems . 1-rhabdomyolysis . the patient had massive cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis . this resulted in tremendous third spacing of fluid and persistent intervascular hypovolemia . the patient 's creatinine ______________ kinase peaked at 56,160 with negative mb percentages . the aldolase was positive at 142 . this was further complicated by hypocalcemia which resulted in mild electrocardiographic abnormalities . the patient 's urine was alkalinized with intravenous bicarbonate to maximize the myoglobin secretion . the patient 's urine output was further augmented by adding dopamine . nevertheless , the patient 's renal failure continued to progress . over the course of the hospitalization his ck fell in the serum . much of his diffuse pain was felt to be due to this massive rhabdomyolysis . 2-renal failure . the creatinine was 4.4 on admission and peaked at 10.5 on the 15th . the urinalysis revealed 4+ albumin with marked occult blood . peritoneal dialysis was instituted on 4/11 after a tenckhoff catheter was placed by drs. freierm , le , and round . subsequently his creatinine rose for three days and then stabilized at 10 . he continued to make minimal urine throughout the hospitalization . 3-disseminated intravascular coagulation . on admission the patient 's prothrombin time was 27.7 with a partial thromboplastin time of greater than 100 and a d-dimer positive at 8 with a fibrinogen of 69 . he went on to develop profound thrombocytopenia complicated by hemorrhage . the patient was supported with abundant use of fresh frozen plasma , cryoprecipitate , platelets , and packed red blood cells . his dic was further complicated by hepatic failure which resulted in poor endogenous production of clotting factors and he remained fresh frozen plasma dependent . 4-septic shock . the patient remained pressor dependent throughout his hospitalization . he was maintained variously on levophed , dobutamine , dopamine , and ultimately epinephrine for blood pressure support . hemodynamic monitoring revealed low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac output . he had multiple sources of infection including his sinuses , lungs , and multiple lines . this will be discussed below . further he had massive muscle necrosis and hepatic failure . an echocardiogram on 4/12 revealed a dilated left ventricle which was diffusely mildly hypokinetic with no vegetations . his ejection fraction was 55% . on 4/16 the pulmonary artery catheter was placed which revealed a wedge pressure of 8 , cardiac index of 4.5 , and an svr of 5.8 . 5-hepatic failure . his sgpt on admission was 2,520 with a peak at 7,680 on hospital day two . he had complete loss of synthetic and conjugation function of the liver with rising bilirubin and falling albumin with dependence on transfusion for support of his prothrombin time . he was seen in consultation by the gi service and the liver transplantation service . given his multiple other medical problems , the direness of his situation , and his ongoing substance abuse at the time of admission he was deemed not to be a candidate for a liver transplantation . 6-cocaine intoxication . serum cocaine was positive 6-12 hours ingestion at the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital . further , at ceanotsit ortgold center his serum toxicology screens were positive . this is thought to be the insighting cause of his massive rhabdomyolysis and hepatic failure . 7-pneumonia . the patient developed two pneumonias with two separate organisms . the first was acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus , treated with ciprofloxacin and gentamicin . he subsequently developed a staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was treated with vancomycin , dosed to levels appropriate for his renal failure . he was seen in consultation by the infectious disease service who advised us on antibiotic choices daily . 8-pancreatitis . the amylase on admission was 279 with a lipase of 161 . although not fully this may have contributed to his hypocalcemia and volume requirements . 9-catheter tip infections . the patient grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus from the femoral lines which were placed during his profound hypertension . these were treated with vancomycin . 10-anemia . the patient 's hematocrit was 33% on admission and fell to 28 requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells over the course of his hospitalization . 11-coma . the patient , although initially minimally responsive , went on to develop a deep comatose state . a ct scan on admission revealed no evidence of hemorrhage though he did have sphenoid sinusitis . the lumbar puncture and sinus exploration were unable to be performed given the patient 's persistent coagulopathy . the patient was treated empirically with nafcillin and ceftriaxone for meningitis and sinusitis . further complicating this was his profound liver failure with rising ammonias and hepatic encephalopathy . despite maximal supports the patient continued to be hypotensive . mid-way through his hospital course he developed trilobar pneumonia and this was probably complicated further by adult respiratory distress syndrome and the multi-organ system failure syndrome . the patient remained mechanically ventilated throughout his hospitalization . nevertheless , he developed refractory hypoxemia , hypotension , and ultimately the patient died despite total life support . discharge diagnosis : cocaine intoxication , rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , septic shock , hepatic failure , pneumonia , pancreatitis , catheter tip infection , anemia , coma . principal procedure : peritoneal dialysis catheter placement , peritoneal dialysis , arterial catheterization , venous catheterization , continuous mechanical ventilation , and parenteral nutrition . complications during admission : neck hematoma secondary to pulmonary artery line placement requiring transfusion , catheter tip infection . medications on discharge : none . condition on discharge : the patient was discharged to samfer street with no autopsy

kidney pain \" . this patient is an unfortunate young gentleman who was initially diagnosed with a germ cell tumor in the fall of 1997 after undergoing orchiectomy with a left scrotal mass and underwent three cycles of dep therapy for pulmonary involvement . in the summer of 1998 he was found to have a retroperitoneal mass which ultimately revealed angiosarcoma of presumed germ-cell transformation . in early 1999 he underwent resection of this mass however in february of 1999 he was found to have a new right pleural mass and subsequently underwent pleurodesis and chemotherapy with ifosfamide and adriamycin for six cycles . in 05/99 he had increasing abdominal pain and evaluation revealed extensive progressive retroperitoneal disease as well as left hydronephrosis . in early 2000 he was started on therapy with taxol per dr. azel hibbskays and finished this in march of this year . ct imaging at that time was negative for disease . in april of this year , he was found to have acute renal failure with left hydronephrosis and this was treated with percutaneous nephrostomy tube on that side . thereafter he began chemotherapy with taxotere in 05/13 and his nephrostomy tube was removed after being displaced on 06/14/00 . most recently he has had problems with nausea , vomiting , fever and left sided abdominal pain and was admitted to the pointexasp region general hospital on 06/16/00 . that hospital course was sign for hydration , antibiotics for questionable pneumonia and more importantly , tachycardia and respiratory distress ultimately secondary to a large left pulmonary arterial mass that was likely a thrombus . he was treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis ( tpa ) and was discharged on 06/28/00 on high dose , low molecular weight heparin . it was entirely clear that this mass represents a clot , certainly this could have been tumor embolization . finally , the patient developed hyponatremia with a sodium down to 130 and was otherwise eventually discharged to pre health with morphine for comfort care and advanced care plans , not to be resuscitated in the event of a life-threatening situation . mr. pruesschird returns tonight after

{"id": 300, "label": 1, "text": "chief complaint : cean leach is a 38 year old male who is admitted in transfer from the morehegron valley hospital in ville , virginia for further evaluation and management of accelerating chest pains syndrome . mr. leach has a long and complex history of coronary artery disease . he was without known cardiovascular illness until he suffered an acute anterior myocardial infarction in august of l988 . he was treated at that time with tpa . a subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% lesion in his proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and minor disease elsewhere in his coronary distribution . his ejection fraction was in the mid-50's. because of angina following that catheterization , he ultimately underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronary artery . he did well until he developed recurrent angina in march of l991 at which time repeat catheterization demonstrated restenosis of his left anterior descending and he underwent a second ptca with good results . he again did well until approximately late l992 . since that time , he has had multiple admissions to george'sdgot medical center with recurrent chest pain . he has ruled in for small r q wave myocardial infarctions on many but not all of these occasions . he has had a progressive decline in his left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by non-invasive means with an echo ejection fraction in the low 40's and radionuclide ejection fraction estimated in august of l994 at 31% . he was admitted to george'sdgot medical center with a typical episode of this discomfort in october of l994 . he was transferred at that time to the ph university of medical center . that was his first ph university of medical center admission . because of mr. leach 's history and the fact that multiple cardiac catheterizations prior to that transfer had failed to demonstrate fixed epicardial coronary disease , it was decided that he should undergo provocative testing to evaluate whether or not he had coronary artery spasm and / or impaired coronary flow reserve . his angiograms from morehegron valley hospital from his four prior catheterizations were reviewed and the patient was gradually tapered off all of his vasoactive medications . he was taken to the catheter laboratory on october 13 , 1994 . there he had a right heart catheterization with unremarkable intercardiac pressures . repeat coronary angiography once again failed to demonstrate any significant obstructive lesions in either his dominant right coronary artery or his left coronary system . he then underwent a doppler coronary flow study which demonstrated impaired coronary flow reserve . specifically , his coronary flow maximally increased by a factor of 2-2.5 whereas a normal response is considered to a 3-4 fold increasing in coronary flow to maximal stimulus . following the coronary flow studies , he was given greater doses of intracoronary ergonovine to assess his susceptibility to coronary artery spasm . he had a normal response to ergonovine that is he had diffuse narrowing of his coronary arteries without induction of focal spasm . however , he did develop typical anginal discomfort which was easily reversed with intracoronary nitroglycerin . it was felt that the time that this study was most consistent with a syndrome of impaired coronary flow reserve or microvascular angina . he was treated with increasing doses of two calcium channel blockers and gradually ambulated in the hall without discomfort and was discharged to home . following that admission in october he had a symptom free interval which lasted a couple of months . starting in the october of l994 , he once again started having recurrences of his typical anginal discomfort . this occurred at rest and with exercise . he had multiple admissions to the morehegron valley hospital once again ruling in for a small r q wave myocardial infarctions on a number of these occasions . his medications were adjusted many times without adequate interruption of the pattern of increasingly frequent and increasingly severe episodes of pain . his most recent admission to the morehegron valley hospital is on april 5 , of 1994 . he had a prolonged episode of typical anginal pain and rule in for a small q wave myocardial infarction . because of the refractory nature of his chest pain and the failure of multiple drug combinations to control his symptoms , he was transferred to ph university of medical center on 4-9-94 . his medications that had been used individually or in combination include beta blockers and lodapine cardiazem , nifidepine and coumadin , aspirin , cyclopadine and seratonin antagonists . there is no history of drug abuse or smoking . of note , his brother had a myocardial infarction in his late 20's . there is no other family history of premature coronary disease or history of stroke or deep venous thrombosis suggestive of hypercoaguable state . of note , his prior work-up has also included screening test for hypercoaguability with normal levels of protein s and c and an unrevealing right ventricular under myocardial biopsy . his medications on admission included isordil , lovastatin , aspirin , heparin and lodapine , cardizem and lasix . physical examination : he looked generally well . his blood pressure l60/90 . his heart rate was 88 . his jugular venous pressure was normal . his chest was clear and his carotids were brisk and his cardiac examination revealed a soft systolic flow murmur . his abdomen was obese with no palpable organomegaly . his femoral pulses were l+ and equal without bruits . he had trace peripheral edema and excellent peripheral pulses . his initial laboratory values included a sodium of l38 . potassium of 3.2 . normal chloride and co2 . his bun was 12 and his creatinine was 1.1 . glucose was l55 although subsequent determinations were normal . his fasting cholesterol was 174 with an hdl of 35 and an ldh of 97 . his liver function tests were normal with the exception of his ldh which was mildly elevated to 222 . his hematocrit was approximately 39 with an unremarkable differential and normal platelet count . his sedimentation rate was 32 and was 40 on repeat testing . hospital course : the primary concern upon mr. leach 's transfer was that despite the fact that he had multiple previous catheterizations over the prior two years that he may have redeveloped obstructive coronary artery disease . it was ; therefore , felt appropriate to start his repeat work-up by repeating his cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography . to that end , he was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on 4-10-94 , there he underwent right and left heart catheterization , coronary angiography and left ventriculography . the right heart catheter which was done using a swanz ganz catheter advanced to 8 french sheath and right femoral vein revealed a mean right atrial pressure 3 mm of mercury and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 mm of mercury . the left ventricular pressure was l05/12 . coronary angiography revealed a picture which was essentially unchanged from october of l994 . that is there was no obstructive large vessel or coronary artery disease although there were some diffuse luminal irregularities . left ventriculography revealed a large area of antero lateral and apical hypokinesis to akinesis with an estimated ejection fraction of 35% . impression at the time of his catheterization was that the precise etiology of his chest pain remained rather enigmatic . he was ; therefore , seen in consultation by dr. lato tikfreierm of the hematology service to evaluate him further for a possible hypocoagulable condition versus primary and secondary platelet abnormality which could explain his recurrent coronary events . after an extensive evaluation including in vitro testing and flow cytometry of mr. leach 's platelets , it was ultimately determined that he did in fact have a primary platelet defect . specifically , his platelets were not affected by aspirin and showed spontaneous hyperaggragability . this was utilized in making some changes in mr. leach 's regiment . specifically his aspirin was discontinued and he was put back on ticlopidine at a higher than ordinary dose at 500 mg. b.i.d. repeat in vitro testing of mr. leach 's platelets suggested that although they remained refractory to aspirin , they did demonstrate reduced hyperaggragability spontaneously which was felt to be possible reflective of the ticlopidine effect . while in the hospital , mr. leach continued to nearly daily episodes of chest pain . these were generally spontaneous in nature and lasted anywhere from several minutes to nearly an hour duration . there were typically improved but not completely eradicated with sublingual nitroglycerin and generally required i.v. narcotics for complete pain relief . because of the ongoing nature of his pain . multiple changes and additions were made to his drug regimen . he was tried on theophylline and imipramine without real change in his chest pain syndrome . he was tried on a variety of different combinations of calcium channel blockers including amlodipine and diltiazem and lodipine and verapamil . amlodipine and bepridil all without marked change in his clinical syndrome . the rest of his hypercoagulable work-up revealed that he had nearly normal levels of clotting factors , specifically , his antithrombin 3 of level was lll with a reference range of 80-120 . protein c was 85 with a reference range of 70-140 . protein s was l14 with a reference range of 70-140 . plasminogen was slightly high at l51 with upper limit of normal being l30 . factor 8 was likewise slightly high at 249 with a reference range of 50-200 . thrombin time and repalase time were normal . it was felt that these results were non-specific and may represent just an acute phase reactants . his anti-cardio lipen antibodies both igm and igg were within normal range . his apc resistance was normal . he was seen in consultation by both rheumatology and endocrinology to evaluate the possibility of primary connective tissue disease an / or possible a theochromocytoma . rheumatology felt that there was no good evidence of a primary vasculitic process as the source of his presumed small vessell coronary disease and no further rheumatologic work-up was undertaken . he had multiple 24 hour urine tests performed to evaluate the question of theochromocytoma , these demonstrated mild elevations of some urinary catacholomines , but it was felt that this could well represent a reaction to the complex medical regimen that he was having as well as the recurrent episodes of pain themselves . it was not felt that he had good evidence of theochromocytoma . his compliment levels were normal and he had no evidence of hepatitis , b serologies which also measured to see if there was some chronic inflammatory process . because of the persistent nature of his pain and the inability to control it adequately on constantly changing a quite complex medical regimen , it was suggested that a sympathetic blockade be performed as a method of controlling his chest pain syndrome . to evaluate the efficacy of this prior to commiting him to a permanent blockade procedure , a temporary sympathetic blockade was performed using a local anesthetic and stellate ganglion injection . prior to performing that an exercise tolerance test was performed on may 13 . that study demonstrated that the patient was able to exercise for ten minutes of a standard protocol and stopped because of fatigue ; although he had no significant st changes with exercise , he did experience his typical anginal chest discomfort which was ultimately relieved of the combination of sublingual nitroglycerin and i.v. morphine sulfate . on the basis of that test , he underwent stellate block the following day . that was performed in the pain clinic using l% lidocaine to the skin and l0 cc of bupivacaine under fluoroscopic guidance at the level of t1 . this produced a good sympathetic block with evidence of a rise in temperature in the left arm and ptosis and myosis of the left eye . he was then taken directly from the pain clinic to the exercise laboratory and repeat exercise testing was done . he once again exercised for ten minutes achieved the same rate pressure product and had no chest discomfort . this encouraged his care takers to pursue a more permanent sympathetic blockade . after extended discussions with pain service , mr. leach was brought back down to the pain clinic on october 27 . there a catheter was placed at the level of t1 under fluroscopic guidance . once again narcaine was injected to induce a sympathetic block . the catheter was left in place for approximately 24 hours with recurrent injections maintained the sympathetic block and during that time he had no recurrent angina . after extensive discussions with the patient , the pain service and thoracic surgery , it was felt appropriate to proceed with a surgical sympathectomy to relieve him of his intractable chest pain syndrome . therefore , on october 27 , the patient underwent left thorascopic thoracic sympathectomy by dr. aalv sctroi . he tolerated that procedure well and had no recurrent anginal pain throughout the rest of his hospitalization . he had incisional pain which was well-controlled with a combination of percocet and morphine sulfate and progressively ambulated and was discharged to home in good condition free of recurrent angina on may 27 , 1995 . discharge medications : ticlopodine 500 mg. p.o.b.i.d. lovastatin 20 mg. p.o.q.d. lasix 80 mg. q.d. kayciel 60 meq

day prior to admission he complained discomfort over a suprapubic catheter area . the patient had missed his usual monthly change of his suprapubic catheter and felt discomfort and noticed some blood at the site of the catheter . the patient was brought to the emergency room one day prior to admission where he was evaluated by urology and had his catheter changed . the patient at that time noted slight shortness of breath but was sent home anyway . on the day of admission the patient noticed increasing shortness of breath . the patient was noted to be confused and to be disoriented toward the

of angina in the distant past . 4. history of colon cancer with a colectomy in the past . medications on admission : 1. ativan 1 mg po twice a day . 2. trusopt 1 gtt left eye three times a day . 3. xalatan 0.005% one gtt left eye qhs . 4. brimonidine 1 gtt left eye three times a day . 5. combivent 3 puffs four times per day . 6. aerobid three puffs twice a day . 7. sorbitol 30 cc every other day . physical examination : he was an elderly frail gentleman in moderate respiratory distress . he had a blood pressure 110/70 , heart rate 110 beats per minute and regular , respiratory rate 25 . he was in moderate respiratory distress . his temperature was 98f . he had a normal head , eyes , ears , nose and throat exam . neck exam revealed no jugular venous distention and no masses . lung exam revealed decreased breath sounds as well as crackles in the bases . there were no wheezes or rhonchi . heart exam revealed a soft s1 and s2 , no murmur was heard , no s3 . abdomen was soft , nontender with no masses palpable . rectal exam was unremarkable with stool heme negative . neurological exam revealed an alert and oriented x 3 elderly male . he moved all extremities . deep tendon reflexes were symmetrical in all extremities . laboratory and radiologic data : sodium 148 , potassium 3.4 , glucose 174 , p02 102 , pc02 115 , ph 7.11 on 40% 02 . blood urea nitrogen 11 , creatinine .6 , uric acid 3.0 , alkaline phosphatase 78 , creatinine phosphokinase isoenzymes too low , hematocrit 41 , white blood cell count 11.6 . urine analysis showed 20-50 white blood cells and 3-5 red blood cells . electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 123 beats per minute compared to previous electrocardiogram of 1/29 there were no significant changes . hospital course : the patient was stabilized in the medical intensive care unit . he stayed in the unit for about one day . during that period of time he received nebulizer treatments with albuterol . he was also started on intravenous ticarcillin for possible gram negative pneumonia . he was diuresed with intravenous lasix to which he responded with at lease a 2l urine output on the first day and 1.5l the second day . after one day in the medical intensive care unit the patient was stable enough to go to the floor where he continued the rest of his treatment . this consisted of continued nebulizer treatments as well as intravenous antibiotics and intravenous solu-medrol . as the patient 's diuresis continued his respiratory status improved . a chest x-ray showed clearing of the opacities in the chest x-ray that were consistent with pulmonary edema because he continued to have some abnormality in the right lower lobe . the patient was continued on antibiotics for possible pneumonia . the antibiotic chosen was levaquin 500 mg 1 tab per day . this was started on 4/2/99 and should be continued for ten days . the ticarcillin was stopped after two days when it was felt that he did not have a serious pneumonia . the patient 's respiratory status continued to improve but towards the last 2-3 days of his hospitalization the amount of improvement was minimal . it was felt that his respiratory status has been maximally treated by then . the patient 's major improvement came after the first two days with brisk diuresis with lasix . while in the oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital the patient on 4/4/99 complained of mild epigastric discomfort because he was put in cimetidine while in the intensive care unit for prophylaxis against peptic ulcer disease . the patient was upgraded to prilosec 20 mg per day for possible treatment of gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease . the patient did have any nausea , vomiting or evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding . the patient 's abdominal pain should be followed over the next week or so in case it does not respond to prilosec . while in oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital the patient was never able to get out of bed and walk independently . it is hoped that when he is transferred to a rehab facility that he will continue with physical therapy to regain his strength and regain independence in activities of daily living . discussion with the family regarding the possibility of sending him to a nursing home was entertained however the family strongly refused to allow him to go a nursing home . they wanted the patient to return to his home after a stay at a rehab facility . condition on discharge : the patient 's respiratory status was stable . i think his breathing was as good as to be expected with the amount of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease he had . he needed to go to a rehab facility for continued respiratory therapy and for physical therapy to increase his muscle strength . medications on discharge : 1. albuterol 2.5 mg in 2.5 normal saline q4h . 2. heparin 5000 units subcutaneously twice a day . 3. ativan .5 mg twice a day . 4. nasal oxygen 3l per minute . 5. levaquin 500 mg per day to be continued

spasticity . she was found to have intermedullary lesion at c1-2 level which on biopsy showed abnormal vasculature , hemosiderin deposit , leading in turn to the discovery of a dural arteriovenous malformation at that level which was surgically corrected . the postoperative period was complicated by transient swallowing difficulty , increasing left sided weakness and urinary retention . she was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation where she made significant progress toward recovery . as of the beginning of september , 1999 , she was able to swallow without difficulty , urinate without difficulty ( although bowel movements have been problematic ) . functionally , she was at the level of pre-gait training and able to stand and take several steps with upper body support . over the past 4-5 weeks her functional level has progressively deteriorated . she is now unable to stand and needs assistance to sit up . her left arm has developed a flexure contraction and she reports intermitttent pain in the left arm and leg which occurs both spontaneously and is also triggered by contact . she has developed some new swallowing difficulty and since her transfer to a long term inpatient care facility , she has lost ten pounds . she denies dysuria or excessive urinary frequency . over the past several weeks she has also developed severe intermittent abdominal pain , localized to the suprapubic area , left greater than right , occurring intermittently . the patient feels this is secondary to her hemorrhoids , although it does not clearly localize to the rectum .

anti-glycemic medications . she will be transferred back to her long term care facility on a czi sliding scale for close management of her sugars pending further assessment of her baseline anti-glycemic medication needs . 2. neurological : the patient has a history of transient ischemic attacks in the past . her seizure was thought secondary to hypoglycemia and she had no further seizure activity in the hospital . she did have some slightly paranoid behavior which her son says is typical . she was continued on her trazodone , neurontin and zyprexa . 3. cardiovascular : the

radiation therapy to the right clavicle 07/16/2004 . history of present illness : one of several puomc admissions for this 88-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer initially diagnosed in 1997 and treated with surgery , radiation , and hormonal treatment . she had actually completed her five years of tomaxifin , but was continuing to be plagued by menopausal symptoms and finally in the summery of 2004 understanding the obvious potential risks , she began an estrogen patch . not long afterwards she began to develop some bone pains which progressed over the late summer and fall requiring escalation of opiates and restaging confirmed the presence of metastases throughout her spine and in the base of her skull , ribs , arms , etc ... but no visceral involvement . she ultimately was admitted to the hospital because of delirium and difficulty controlling the pain . she had no fevers , chills , headaches , or neck stiffness . there had been no focal neurologic changes . up until this admission she had been relatively independent and was very dismayed to discover the extensive relapse of her disease . on admission to the hospital her temperature was 99 , heart rate 99 , blood pressure 151/87 , o2 saturation on room air was 92% . she did look mildly dyspneic . her lungs were clear . she had good range of motion throughout except for severe local tenderness and swelling on the mid third of her right clavicle which impaired right shoulder movement . she was oriented to place and name and this waxed and waned over the next couple of days . the rest of her neurologic exam was essentially intact . laboratory data : sodium of 137 , bun of 25 , creatinine of 0.9 , glucose of 77 , calcium slightly high at 10.9 with an albumin of 3.7 . bilirubin normal . her alt 11 , her ast slightly up at 59 . her alk phos slightly up at 174 . wbc 10.8 with normal differential . hemoglobin 12.2 , hematocrit 36.6 , mcv 89 , platelets 345,0000 . a urinalysis showed cloudy urine with 10-20 red cells and 20-50 white cells . a ca 153 was significantly elevated at 66.5 ( normal 0-30 ) . the patient was brought to the floor , hydrated gently , given another dose of zomaten to help with her calcium and over the next few days remained relatively lethargic while we held some of her long acting opiates . she gradually began to improve and was able to tell if the worst pain was in the right clavicle . this was assessed promptly by an x-ray that confirmed pathologic fracture of that site . she also went on to have cervical , thoracic , and lumbosacral mris to confirm the wide spread bony metastases in the vertebral bodies and old degenerative changes perhaps with some indentation of the thecal sac but with no radiologic evidence for cord compression . she had had some urinary hesitancy and difficulty moving her legs in the first few days that had lead to the concern to _________ quinine syndrome but as soon as the opiates were tapered down she was able to void spontaneously and soon began to ambulate with the help of physical therapy . a single fraction to the collar bone seemed to help with pain . her bowels required fairly heavy duty osmotic laxatives to keep them open . the sudden plunge in such a dependent state left her quite depressed and ultimately a small dose of dexedrine was started partly to overcome the sedation of the opiates and perhaps improve her mood since more traditional antidepressants would take four to six weeks . plan : escalate the doses of the dexedrine perhaps up to a maximum of 10 mg at 8 o'clock in the morning and another 10 mg around noon and see if she can get reasonable sleep at night on this schedule , adding on remeron at night time for sleep as an antidepressant would be a possibility or to go right to a conventional ssri overlap until it seems to show more affect . she lives with her elderly husband and he was appropriately overwhelmed by the prospect of caring for her single-handedly , hence the transfer to a skilled nursing facility for a week or two of rehab . the patient and husband clearly expressed during this visit that she would not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation and ventilator support in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest . she was begun on letrazole as an ____________ inhibitor for her breast cancer and discussions were begun to consider a possible course or two of xeloda perhaps at a dose reduced scheduled if she continues to make progress in rehab and can return to dr. first 's office to have further discussions of this later approach

1) gi - the patient was admitted to the floor and underwent extraction of the piece of chicken from his esophagus later that afternoon . extraction was successful and foreign body was removed piecemeal . egd was performed . subsequently at the site where the chicken was stuck there was no notable trauma or lesion distal to the chicken . there was some gastritis and duodenitis but no frank ulcers . the patient was sent to the floor and gi wise was doing well until approximately 9/22/93 when he developed an ileus one day status post teeth extraction and general anesthesia . the patient also had a gi bleed at that time and an ng tube was placed with removal of 2500 cc of dark brown bilious guaiac positive fluid . the patient was stabilized with fluid and improved quickly from this status over the weekend and hct has been stable since that time . other gi issues include the patient 's hypopharyngeal cancer which will be discussed below . 2) oncology - the patient was diagnosed prior to this admission with hypopharyngeal cancer for which he was going to undergo external radiation therapy for . because of the multiple complications and lack of nutrition and inability of the patient to swallow without aspirating it was felt that this should be delayed until he is under better nutritional status . 3) feeding and nutrition - the patient was unable to eat any food or drink by mouth given that he demonstrated frank aspiration each time he attempted this including with soft solids and puree foods . a swallowing study was performed which clearly demonstrated frank aspiration and poor swallowing mechanism by the patient . several ng tubes were placed and the patient kept pulling the ng tubes out because his mental status was not completely cleared . the patient was sustained on iv fluids with d10 and multivitamins , thiamine , and folate . he was kept npo given his history of aspiration and further attempts were made to fee the patient and finally as the patient 's mental status cleared he was responsive to having an ng feeding tube placed with jevity feeds started . other options were considered including a peg placement as well as surgical placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it was felt that less aggressive measures with an ng tube would be prudent at this juncture given the patient 's poor prognosis for the future . the family was involved in making decisions regarding the patient 's nutritional status and originally felt that iv fluids alone should be used , however , finally decided that some sort of feeding should be undertaken and the ng tube was the initial thought . it is felt that if the ng tube does not work out the patient may need to be reassessed for potential placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it is felt by all parties involved that the aggressive end may also present significant risk to this patient given that an operative procedure may be dangerous and patient has shown significant desaturation and uncooperativeness with his first egd on admission . 4) pulmonary - the patient had a clear chest x-ray other than a right lower lobe opacity consistent with scarring vs. fat pad which has been chronic on admission . the patient was saturating well throughout the initial part of the stay until he had the upper gi bleed on 9/22/93 at which time he also had significant aspiration of vomitus and was considered to have a probable aspiration pneumonia but with vague findings on chest x-ray . the chest x-ray cleared rather rapidly and on the third day post aspiration was consistent with the original admission x-ray . however , after aspiration given that the patient had a white count bump from under 10,000 to 16,000 it was felt that he should be started on antibiotics and he was started on ceftriaxone and clindamycin for a total 10 day course for presumptive aspiration pneumonia . the patient was afebrile throughout this period and tolerated antibiotics well and pneumonia appeared to resolve . no organism was ever cultured out of the sputum . 5) gu - the patient was not entirely responsive to using urinal or the bathroom and at times was incontinent . it was thought that a foley catheter would be most appropriate and he seemed to tolerate this well . he had at one point the possibility of uti but he was asymptomatic and on rechecking the urine there was no sign of urinary tract infection . the patient continued to be asymptomatic . 6) neurological - the patient originally was almost completely non-responsive at least to verbal command but as his hospital course progressed he became somewhat more alert and towards the end of his hospital course was much more alert and oriented usually only times two and was difficult . the patient was much more cooperative towards the end of his stay and much more appropriate , however , he did not seem to fully comprehend the fact that he had cancer and that he would not be able to swallow things by mouth . these issues were explained to him repeatedly , however , he did not appear to comprehend them from day to day . psychiatry evaluated the patient and felt that he was not competent to decide his own affairs . 7) social issues - the wife had obtained health proxy prior to this admission and it was felt that since the patient was not competent to make decisions on his own the wife would make decisions regarding the health status and treatment of the patient . it was decided the patient 's code status would not be dnr , dni . 8) dental - the patient was noted to have very few teeth and it was noted that none appeared viable and it was felt that since he would be undergoing xrt in the future that his teeth should be removed to avoid radiation necrosis in the future when he received his xrt . he underwent extraction of all his teeth on 9/21/93 tolerating the procedure well initially but then developed the ileus as noted above and subsequently a gi bleed . laboratory data on discharge revealed sma 7 with sodium 134 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 , co2 24 , bun 5 , and creatinine 0.9 which has been stable at 0.9 to 1.0 with glucose 96 . cbc revealed hct 30.7 which has been ranging from high of 29 to 31 over the last week . the white count was 7.5 , platelets 196 . the last pt and ptt on 09/26/93 were 13.4 and 27.3 with inr of 1.2 . the last ua and sedimentation revealed rare white blood cells but was otherwise negative and the culture revealed no growth on 09/27/93 . the patient had a chest x-ray which showed a few right upper lobe and one left upper lobe nodule and a follow-up chest x-ray on 09/27/93 showed resolution of these previous nodular shadows . a faint nodule remained in the left upper lobe and it was felt that this is probably not any metastatic disease and not of concern , however , it was suggested that follow-up chest x-ray may be taken to insure that these densities resolve . operative procedures : extraction of all remaining teeth under general anesthesia on 9/21/93 . complications : 1) aspiration pneumonia . 2) gi bleed . 3) ileus secondary to general anesthesia for above operation . disposition : condition on discharge : the patient is stable on discharge . the patient is to be transferred to paw.ryfear medical center for further care including physical therapy , occupational therapy , and further nutritional support . discharge medications : pepcid 20 mg po iv b.i.d. for history of gastritis and gi bleed , heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d.

center admissions for this 74-year old female with multiple medical problems who developed multiple myeloma with bench jones proteinuria over one year ago . there were lytic lesions seen in her bones and the patient was started on intermittent courses of melphalan with prednisone . she had a partial response , but continued to have inappropriate amounts of gamma globulins in her blood and urine and remained anemic and poorly responsive to erythropoietin . the patient has had one previous admission for the same symptoms a couple of months ago that she came in with this time , namely generalized weakness which in fact has on both occasions been accompanied by progressively worsening renal insufficiency . the weakness is non focal although since she has had chronic problems with pain in her legs for uncertain reasons she was having difficulty walking . her appetite was gone . she was having some nausea . no recent history of a change in her medicines or lapse in them . no changes in her breathing . she did not seem sleepy or confused . physical examination : blood pressure 130/40 , heart rate 78 regular . weight 132 , ( had been 126 one year previously ) . temperature 97 . the patient was pale with a fine tremor of her upper extremities . she could walk hesitantly for a few steps , was anicteric , lucid , not tachypneic . she has flat affect at baseline and does not give may clues about somatic distress when she has some . her lungs were clear . heart ; without murmur or gallop . her jugular venous pressure was four to five centimeters of water , carotid upstrokes normal . soft , non tender abdomen with normal bowel sounds . no hepatosplenomegaly or masses . she had 2+ edema of the ankles without tender cords or erythema . she was moving all four extremities . her cranial nerves were grossly intact to inspection . laboratory data on admission : hematocrit 24.6 , white count 4.0 , platelet count 170,000 , normal differential , sodium 143 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 113 , carbon dioxide 18.9 , bun and creatinine 71/5.2 , glucose 177 . hospital course and treatment : the patient was admitted to the ponta,itri- university medical center as a front door admission and although her electrocardiogram is equivocal , a second potassium also came back elevated so she was treated with two doses of sodium k-exulate with improvement of her potassium to within normal limits . over the following days , she was gently hydrated . her urine was alkalinized using intravenous and later oral sodium bicarbonate and her creatinine rose to a high of about 5.8 . she was seen by the nephrology service and it was deemed quite likely that the acute and chronic renal insufficiency that had progressed causing this admission was related to her myeloma kidney . in the weeks prior to admission she had just begun thalidomide orally as a salvage treatment for her myeloma . she tolerated without sedation but probably was not at a therapeutic dose and it had had no impact by the time of her admission . the patient , her son randdor so and i had several long conversations about the potential for further renal deterioration and need for hemodialysis . the family and the patient felt quite clearly that hemodialysis was not indicated if the underlying myeloma was not controllable . they did agree , however to one more attempt at pulse decadron therapy with consists of oral decadron forty mgs po q.day ( in divided doses ) for four consecutive days followed by four days off , followed by four days on , etc. for a total of eight sessions of four days of decadron on . by the time she had left she had completed only the first of the four consecutive days as expected her blood sugars went up into high 300's or 400s and she needed sliding scale regular insulin in addition to standing doses of nph . on the days when she was not on decadron the standing doses of nph were sometimes suspended because her blood sugars would get to 41 and she would have remarkably few symptoms in this setting , perhaps related to the low dose beta blockers that she also takes . there had been a slight down turn in her creatinine by discharge to 4.7 but there was concern that she could not tolerate any greater hydration rates due to crackles in her bases although her jugular venous pressure went about six and she was never symptomatic with fluid overload . potassium did not appear to be a problem throughout the rest of her hospitalization . she was also seen by the pain service who was baffled by the cause for her lower extremity leg pain that has been present for several years , not progressive , minimally responsive to narcotics and currently on a second trial of neurontin of dubious value and would probably by the first medicine that i discontinue if she was feeling too sleepy or weak . the problem may be a combination of degenerative joint disease with spinal stenosis as well as neuropathic changes from diabetes +/- her myeloma . the patient also requested to be do not resuscitate , do not intubate and this was also in agreement with her son so . the patient is transferred to a skilled nursing facility to continue the pulses of decadron under close monitoring for blood sugars insulin regulation and to see that her potassium does not worsen and that perhaps her creatinine will improve a slight bit more , although probably not come back to normal . she will finish her last planned pulse of decadron by about november 25 , 2003 at which point depending on her creatinine and her status we may or may not elect further such treatments . medications on discharge : 1. heparin 5000 units subq b.i.d. 2. clonazepam 0.5 mgs po q.h.s. 3. risperidone 3 mgs po q.h.s. 4. regular insulin on a

301 to 350 give eight units subq , from 351 to 400 give ten units subq , and if over 400 give twelve units subq. she also has standing doses of insulin nph ten in the morning , ten in the evening and tentatively these will only be used during the days of high decadron and perhaps should not be used on the days without decadron . 5. metoprolol titrate 12.5 mgs po b.i.d. 6. calcium acetate ( phos-lo

marker is a 60 year-old man presented with a two year history with right neck pain . an initial ct scan was negative , however , eventually a scan in august , 1996 showed a right wedge skull base mass . in september , 1997 he underwent cerebral angiography complicated by an embolic cerebrovascular accident which presented with confusion in an right homonymous hemianopsia . he was taken to the intensive care unit . a follow-up mri showed low attenuation lesions in both occipital lobes consistent with embolic stroke . he was treated with aspirin . november 19 , 1997 , he underwent a resection of a skull base chordoma and a lateral mandibulotomy with tracheostomy . postoperatively he had a right true vocal cord paralysis with evidence of aspiration and he therefore received gelfoam insertion injection into the vocal cord and a peg was preformed . he was discharged home with at follow-up mri and on december 25 , 1997 again revealed a large ill defined lobulated skull based mass with a mass effect on the medulla . now preoperatively he reports occasional sharp pains in his right jaw that last about five seconds then resolves as well as loss of his right peripheral vision , difficulty swallowing . he is taking some liquids p.o. but also has g-tube feedings q.2h. past medical history : status post tonsillectomy , status post appendectomy , status post lumbar fusion remote . diet : jevity plus one can q.12h. by g-tube , some liquids . allergies : the patient is allergic to codeine which causes nausea and morphine which causes swelling . medications on admission : aspirin discontinued in two weeks prior to admission . social history : denies use of alcohol and tobacco . he is married and lives in nebraska , works as a car dealer , has four grandchildren . physical examination : vital signs : heart rate 64 , blood pressure 120/80 . general : this is a pleasant 60 year-old man whose distressed . heent , normocephalic , atraumatic , well healed right jaw incision , slight swelling right jaw slightly tender to the touch , there is no erythema . lungs are clear to auscultation . heart regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs , gallops or

nerves , right visual field deficit , decreased gag , tongue is atrophic and deviates to the right . strength five out of five bilateral upper and lower extremities . deep tendon reflexes 2+ symmetric , toes downgoing . cerebella intact . gait steady . hospital course : this 60 year-old man with a right suboccipital chordoma status post prior resection was admitted and then underwent on jan 22 , 1997 a right suboccipital craniotomy with microresection of tumor along with a laminectomy . postoperatively , he was taken to the neurosurgical intensive care unit where he remained intubated . he was extubated on postoperative day number one . his neurological examination remained unchanged with continued right tongue deviation and lack of gag reflex . he was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number two and he was ambulating . he was seen by physical therapy who noted that he had problems with balancing and he used a rolling walker . he noticed some nose dripping on postoperative day number four however in the next several days there was no evidence of this cerebrospinal fluid leak as he denied any further nose dripping however he was placed on antibiotics to cover a possible cerebrospinal fluid leak . on postoperative day number eight he again reported leaking from the right nostril . he vomited once and had intermittent headaches . a head ct was done to evaluate a possible hydrocephalus , no hydrocephalus was seen where there was an old infarct in the right frontal lobe white matter and the occipital region with a pseudomeningocele , status post resection of the right skull based tumor extending to the c2 level . a lumbar drain was placed and for the next five days 50 cc was drained every eight hours . a culture taken from the lumbar drain showed staphylococcus aureus resistant to the nafcillin which he was receiving and he was therefore placed on vancomycin . he was also receiving ofloxacin for a presumed aspiration pneumonia and a staphylococcus aureus from his cerebrospinal fluid was sensitive to both vancomycin and ofloxacin . he was followed by the speech pathology team who noted that he still had evidence of aspiration . a video swallow was done which showed moderately severe oral pharyngeal dysphasia with premature spill over and laryngeal penetration with aspiration of some liquids . because of continuing complaints by mr. marker about nausea with his tube feedings and concern with his aspiration the g-tube feedings were not ideal . he underwent a conversion of his gastrostomy tube to an transgastrojejunostomy tube by the interventional radiologist on feb 04 , 1997 . prior to admission mr. marker had been taking one can of jevity every two hours as a bolus . after conversion to a jejunostomy tube one would normally use continuous feedings , however mr. marker did not want to use continuous feedings , he prefers the boluses which would not require him to be attached to a feeding tube . it was explained to him that this can result in diarrhea but he has elected to continue bolus feedings . his visiting nurse will be instructed to observe for diarrhea and if problems develop a home jejunostomy feeding tube apparatus will be obtained . his lumbar drain was removed after five days . he was observed overnight and there is no current evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak . he is therefore being discharged on postoperative day number fifteen . medications on discharge : 1) ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week . 2) jevity plus one can q.2h. he will have visiting nurse and home physical therapy services . follow-up : follow-up will be with dr. sick in one weeks time . he will needed a follow-up ct or mri for the pseudomeningocele . addendum mr. marker will be restarted on his preoperative aspirin as he is now far enough out from his surgery . medications on discharge : 1) aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. 2) ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. times seven days . dictated by : stisie h.
