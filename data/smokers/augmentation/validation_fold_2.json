: mr. marker is a 60 year-old man presented with a two year history with right neck pain . an initial ct scan was negative , however , eventually a scan in august , 1996 showed a right wedge skull base mass . in september , 1997 he underwent cerebral angiography complicated by an embolic cerebrovascular accident which presented with confusion in an right homonymous hemianopsia . he was taken to the intensive care unit . a follow-up mri showed low attenuation lesions in both occipital lobes consistent with embolic stroke . he was treated with aspirin . november 19 , 1997 , he underwent a resection of a skull base chordoma and a lateral mandibulotomy with tracheostomy . postoperatively he had a right true vocal cord paralysis with evidence of aspiration and he therefore received gelfoam insertion injection into the vocal cord and a peg was preformed . he was discharged home with at follow-up mri and on december 25 , 1997 again revealed a large ill defined lobulated skull based mass with a mass effect on the medulla . now preoperatively he reports occasional sharp pains in his right jaw that last about five seconds then resolves as well as loss of his right peripheral vision , difficulty swallowing . he is taking some liquids p.o. but also has g-tube feedings q.2h. past medical history : status post tonsillectomy , status post appendectomy , status post lumbar fusion remote . diet : jevity plus one can q.12h. by g-tube , some liquids . allergies : the patient is allergic to codeine which causes nausea and morphine which causes swelling . medications on admission : aspirin discontinued in two weeks prior to admission . social history : denies use of alcohol and tobacco . he is married and lives in nebraska , works as a car dealer , has four grandchildren . physical examination : vital signs : heart rate 64 , blood pressure 120/80 . general : this is a pleasant 60 year-old man whose distressed . heent , normocephalic , atraumatic , well healed right jaw incision , slight swelling right jaw slightly tender to the touch , there is no erythema . lungs are clear to auscultation . heart regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs , gallops or rubs . abdomen g-tube intact , soft non-tender , active bowel sounds . neurological alert and oriented times three , speech is fluent although there is some difficulty of tongue movement . cranial nerves , right visual field deficit , decreased gag , tongue is atrophic and deviates to the right . strength five out of five bilateral upper and lower extremities . deep tendon reflexes 2+ symmetric , toes downgoing . cerebella intact . gait steady . hospital course : this 60 year-old man with a right suboccipital chordoma status post prior resection was admitted and then underwent on jan 22 , 1997 a right suboccipital craniotomy with microresection of tumor along with a laminectomy . postoperatively , he was taken to the neurosurgical intensive care unit where he remained intubated . he was extubated on postoperative day number one . his neurological examination remained unchanged with continued right tongue deviation and lack of gag reflex . he was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number two and he was ambulating . he was seen by physical therapy who noted that he had problems with balancing and he used a rolling walker . he noticed some nose dripping on postoperative day number four however in the next several days there was no evidence of this cerebrospinal fluid leak as he denied any further nose dripping however he was placed on antibiotics to cover a possible cerebrospinal fluid leak . on postoperative day number eight he again reported leaking from the right nostril . he vomited once and had intermittent headaches . a head ct was done to evaluate a possible hydrocephalus , no hydrocephalus was seen where there was an old infarct in the right frontal lobe white matter and the occipital region with a pseudomeningocele , status post resection of the right skull based tumor extending to the c2 level . a lumbar drain was placed and for the next five days 50 cc was drained every eight hours . a culture taken from the lumbar drain showed staphylococcus aureus resistant to the nafcillin which he was receiving and he was therefore placed on vancomycin . he was also receiving ofloxacin for a presumed aspiration pneumonia and a staphylococcus aureus from his cerebrospinal fluid was sensitive to both vancomycin and ofloxacin . he was followed by the speech pathology team who noted that he still had evidence of aspiration . a video swallow was done which showed moderately severe oral pharyngeal dysphasia with premature spill over and laryngeal penetration with aspiration of some liquids . because of continuing complaints by mr. marker about nausea with his tube feedings and concern with his aspiration the g-tube feedings were not ideal . he underwent a conversion of his gastrostomy tube to an transgastrojejunostomy tube by the interventional radiologist on feb 04 , 1997 . prior to admission mr. marker had been taking one can of jevity every two hours as a bolus . after conversion to a jejunostomy tube one would normally use continuous feedings , however mr. marker did not want to use continuous feedings , he prefers the boluses which would not require him to be attached to a feeding tube . it was explained to him that this can result in diarrhea but he has elected to continue bolus feedings . his visiting nurse will be instructed to observe for diarrhea and if problems develop a home jejunostomy feeding tube apparatus will be obtained . his lumbar drain was removed after five days . he was observed overnight and there is no current evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak . he is therefore being discharged on postoperative day number fifteen . medications on discharge : 1) ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week . 2) jevity plus one can q.2h. he will have visiting nurse and home physical therapy services . follow-up : follow-up will be with dr. sick in one weeks time . he will needed a follow-up ct or mri for the pseudomeningocele . addendum mr. marker will be restarted on his

65 year old portuguese male whose cardiac risk factors include hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , tobacco use and a positive family history . he was a previously healthy male who reports a pattern of intermittent chest pain during the week prior to admission . on the night prior to admission he was awakened from sleep with severe substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm , accompanied by back pain at about 9:30 p.m. he was taken to the pre health emergency room and at about 2:45 a.m. on 7/30 an electrocardiogram demonstrated 3 to 4 mm st elevations in leads v1 to v4 and 2 mm st elevations in lead v5 . he was treated with nitroglycerin , antacids and intravenous morphine . he was transferred to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital hemodynamically stable . he arrived in the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital emergency room with a blood pressure of 120/80 , heart rate 90 . an electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 with premature ventricular contractions . it was notable for 4 to 7 mm st elevations throughout the precordium with qs in leads v1 and v2 , with 2 mm st elevations in avl and 1 to 2 mm reciprocal st depressions in leads ii , iii and avf . the initial physical examination was notable for bright red blood per rectum . he was treated with intravenous nitroglycerin , intravenous morphine , aspirin , ativan and a lidocaine drip . because of the noted bright red blood per rectum , thrombolysis was deferred and the patient was taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory . past medical history : notable only for surgical repair of an ulcer and a remote appendectomy . medications on admission : none allergies : penicillin , which gives him a rash . social history : his habits include smoking one pack per day for many years and moderate to heavy alcohol use . physical examination : the patient was an elderly appearing male in no significant distress . his pulse was 84 and regular , blood pressure 114/70 . the head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable . the neck was supple . the carotids were of normal amplitude without bruits . on cardiac examination he had a nonpalpable left ventricular impulse , a quiet s1 and s2 , no murmurs . he had an audible s3 and a jugular venous pressure of 8 . on lung examination he had rales one third up bilaterally . his abdomen was soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly , no guarding and no rebound . on rectal examination he had bright red blood in the vault without any stool . his extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis or edema . laboratory data : the hematocrit was 44.9 , white blood count 14.3 , platelet count 301,000 , sodium 138 , potassium 3.7 , chloride 102 , co2 27.4 , bun 12 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 147 . the electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 , left atrial enlargement , st elevations in v4 through v6 , i and avl , consistent with acute anterolateral myocardial infarction with q waves in v1 to v3 and reciprocal st depressions in leads ii , iii and afv . the chest x-ray showed a normal cardiac and mediastinal silhouette , mild pulmonary edema and an elevated left hemidiaphragm . hospital course : the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where hemodynamic measurements included a right atrial pressure of 7 , a right ventricular pressure of 33/8 , pulmonary artery pressure 29/16 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 16 . he had a proximal 95% left anterior descending lesion and mild to moderate disease in the first obtuse marginal . the left anterior descending lesion was angioplastied to a 30% residual stenosis . an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in the left groin prophylactically . the patient was hemodynamically stable throughout and was transferred to the micu . on hospital day 2 the intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned . the patient was intermittently agitated while on the intra-aortic balloon pump and was treated presumptively for alcohol withdrawal with serax . the lidocaine drip was rapidly weaned as well . on the third hospital day the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed . the intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin were weaned off . after removal of the intra-aortic balloon pump the patient was noticeably less agitated . on the fourth hospital day an attempt was made to transfer the patient to the floor . however , after a single dose of 25 mg of po metoprolol , the patient 's blood pressure dropped to the 60/40 range and he was therefore kept in the micu . the peak cpk level was on the second hospital day and was 5,042 with 26.7% mb fraction . on the fifth hospital day the patient was considered stable for transfer to the floor . once on the floor the patient had no recurrent chest pain . an echocardiogram was performed on the sixth hospital day which demonstrated an ejection fraction of 44% . on transfer to the medical floor the patient was noted to have guaiac negative stool . he was evaluated by the gi service who felt that , given the patient 's course , he could undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy electively at some point in the future . the patient underwent exercise stress testing with thallium on the ninth hospital day . he exercised for 7 minutes and 30 seconds , achieving 80% of the maximal heart rate on the modified bruce protocol . he did not have chest pain . there were st and t wave abnormalities with 2.5 mm horizontal depressions at the beginning of 3 minutes of exercise , which persisted into recovery . the thallium images showed fixed anterior and septal wall defects without any definite evidence of redistribution . based on this data , on the tenth hospital day the patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization which demonstrated a patent left anterior descending site , a circumflex lesion after the third obtuse marginal , and a distal posterior descending artery lesion with a tight stenosis and a small vessel . these findings were considered not to be hemodynamically significant and the patient was therefore to be discharged on medical therapy including nitrates and aspirin . because of his persistently marginal blood pressure at 100/70 , an ace inhibitor which was tried briefly and a beta blockers were elected not to be continued . the patient was discharged in stable condition on the eleventh hospital day . discharge diagnoses : 1. acute myocardial infarction . 2. lower gastrointestinal bleed . medications on discharge : enteric coated aspirin , 1 po qd ; isordil , 10 mg po tid ; serax , 15 mg qhs x five days ; carafate , 1 gram po

electrolytes were normal . her admitting hematocrit was 45% , white count 7,700 , with an mcv of 92 , platelets were normal at 263,000 . albumin 2.5 . hospital course : # 1. cerebrovascular accident . the patient suffered some mild weakness which was attributed to stenosis of the distal right internal carotid artery . this was determined by head ct , head mri , head mra , carotid noninvasive studies , transcranial dopplers . the possibility of a cardiac origin was evaluated by echocardiogram and holter monitor . her echocardiogram curiously showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function , a patent foramen ovale , with a trace right to left shunt , as determined by bubble study , trace mr was present . previous echoes have shown mvp at the ona hospital . her holter showed up to 12 beats of svt , but was otherwise unremarkable . the patient had a normal b12 , negative syphilis serologies and normal thyroid function during this hospitalization . she was anticoagulated with heparin and after several days coumadin was started . her exact coumadin dose is undetermined at this point , however it looks like it will be something around 5 mg a day . her pro time and ptt have normalized at the time of discharge . she needs to be given 5 mg of coumadin tonight , 5/22/92 . in addition heparin should be started to drip on arrival at 400 units an hour . it is discontinued at the time of transport . the patient has received physical therapy and occupational therapy and her recovery is near complete . during evaluation of her neurologic status , it was determined that for several months prior to admission , the patient has been too unsteady to ambulate . on our exam she is found to have a significant amount of ataxia , especially in the midline and the exact cause of this is unknown . there are multiple possible contributions and this is where her need for careful internal medical evaluation has arisen . at the time we were to embark on this evaluation , the patient 's family strongly requested that she be transferred to the sas general hospital . what follows is a summary of her medical problems and their possible relationship to her ataxia . her ataxia is likely due to some cerebellar function , though this is not certain . moreover her mri did not show any discrete cerebellar lesions . our leading theory at this point is that her cerebellar dysfunction relates to perineoplastic syndrome , relating to her history of breast ca . as i mentioned above , her evaluation was limited by her cardiologic status at the time . while mammogram and ca-15.3 and breast exam are all normal , the idea of a perineoplastic syndrome with or without concomitant breast ca has reared its head . two possible markers are anti-hu syndrome and anti-yo antibody . these tests were sent on the 18th and are pending at the time of discharge . the results can be obtained by paging me , do a. joasscchird , m.d. at 834-364-2251 . i will be happy to furnish the results . the patient has a history of mi in 1989 . echocardiogram no longer shows wall motion abnormalities . ekg , when the patient goes out of left bundle branch block transiently shows an anterolateral q/wave inversion . we would like to discontinue her isordil to improve upon some orthostatic hypotension , but we are not certain whether her heart will tolerate this . persantine thallium is scheduled at this time , but is yet to be performed . the patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension x many years . it has been evaluated in the past without success . during her hospitalization , we confirmed the presence of this , even when she was hydrated with saline , to a fractional excretion of sodium of 2% . studies of her autonomic system did not document any dysautonomia . studies of skin galvanic conduction were normal and her rr interval evaluation was not abnormal . this is a chronic problem but may be contributing to her current weakness and inability to walk . florinef is to be considered , however stopping the isordil is one goal . the patient has a history of bronchiectasis from a childhood pneumonia . in addition there is a distant history of m. kansasaii infection . this has been evaluated by dr. screen at sas general hospital and probably relates to her lung xray . ct at the ona hospital in 1989 showed similar findings . a chest ct was to be performed and may be yielding . a ppd was placed and is to be read on saturday , 4 26th . the left volar forearm has the ppd just proximal to the wrist crease and a candida albicans placed just distal to the antecubital fossa . the patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis in 1990 , for which she received 6 months of coumadin . dopplers of her lower extremities were negative on this admission . it is doubtful that she has chronic pe , but this is one consideration . it is likely that she has pulmonary hypertension from her lung disease , and so this is a consideration . the patient had mild hyponatremia during this hospitalization with a sodium as low as 131 . we think this is likely due to an siadh as she is euvolemic . this can be evaluated further and is not a problem

02/04/94 . she was transferred to retelk county medical center for further therapy , and transplant evaluation . patient also received aicd . history of present illness : the patient was initially admitted for further therapy of her idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and for transplant evaluation . patient 's past medical history is to besummarized as follows : in 1990 the patient was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy in hispit , delaware . since that time the patient has been treated medically . in 07/93 the patient underwent exercise tolerance test which showed a mbo2 of 12.7 mg per kilogram . on 09/93 the patient underwent transplant evaluation at retelk county medical center . echocardiogram showed severe pr and mitral regurgitation , mild ai and ejection fraction of 15% to 20% , a markedly dilated left ventricle and moderately dilated right ventricle , and a question of a possible left ventricular and right ventricular thrombus . consequently the patient was started on coumadin . catheterization at that time showed an ra pressure of 60 , cardiac index of 1.7 , svr of 2100 and a pvr of 387 . coronaries were completely normal . consequently the patient was admitted to the ccu for intensive hemodynamic monitoring , and after load reduction . in the ccu the patient was initially treated with nitroprusside and eventually switched to captopril and isordil . hemodynamics were optimized resulting in a cardiac output of 4.4 with a svr of 1300 and a wedge of 16 . pulmonary function tests were obtained which showed marked pulmonary dysfunction with fev1 of 1.4 and markedly decreased elcl of 50% . repeat pulmonary function tests following optimization of cardiac therapy showed somewhat improved but not to a significant degree of the pulmonary function tests . furthermore , due to the patient 's long standing amiodarone therapy , and a positive second pulmonary function , amiodarone was discontinued during that hospital admission . consequently the patient was discharged on captopril , digoxin , lasix , micronase , isordil and prn inhalers . the patient did well at home until 1/31/94 when she was admitted to souland in nixmont bovo with increasing congestive heart failure . at that time the patient was aggressively diuresed . by report , in the interim since discharge from retelk county medical center , amiodarone was restarted for unclear indications . dring this hospitalization at hahkellrick hospital , a dobutamine drip was started to improve hemodynamics , and in the setting of the dobutamine drip the patient had spontaneous ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest . she was quickly defibrillated and converted to sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block . she was treated for a short time with lidocaine and eventually weaned off . she was continued on low dose dobutamine and transferred back to retelk county medical center for further evaluation . the patient was transferred to retelk county medical center on 02/20/94 , again for possible heart-lung transplantation . the patient was evaluated by the chf and heart transplant service . it was felt that the patient was not likely a good transplant candidate secondary to endocurrent lung disease . furthermore , since it was felt that the patient failed amiodarone therapy , the patient was seen by the alllo eino hospital which recommended eps to rule out possible bundle branch reentry as the source of the patient 's arrhythmia with possible aicd placement if the eps was negative . note , per recommendation from the chf team , dobutamine was discontinued within the first 24 hours of the patient 's hospitalization without difficulty . on 02/22/94 an eps study was performed . the patient was negative for inducible ventricular arrhythmias despite maximal stimulation . consequently aicd placement was recommended . consequently , the patient underwent aicd placement on 03/09/94 . note , from 02/22 to 03/09 there is a question of the patient having a right forearm thrombophlebitis . consequently , the patient underwent a full 2 week course of antibiotic therapy along with debridement of the right forearm for placement of the aicd . note , biopsies from the right forearm were significant only for inflammation , and not infection . cultures were negative , and note , no pus or purulent fluid was found upon debridement . thus , aicd placement was performed on 03/09/94 following a 2 week course of antibiotic therapy for presumed ( but later found to be inflammation only ) of right forearm phlebitis . there were no intraoperative or postoperative complications following the aicd placement . by 03/10/94 the patient was able to ambulate without assistance , and was only having minimal tenderness at the aicd placement site . at this point it was felt the patient would go home on 03/13/94 . it was felt that the patient should stay inhouse over the weekend since the patient will be traveling back

consequently , the patient underwent aicd placement on 03/09/94 . hospital course was only complicated by presumed right forearm thrombophlebitis , and the patient completed a 2 week antibiotic course prior to aicd placement . note , for the question of the right forearm thrombophlebitis , the right forearm was debrided and sent for culture and pathology . cultures were negative . debridement was negative for purulent discharge . pathology is only significant for inflammation , and not infection . the patient did well following the aicd placement . there were no intraoperative complications ,

{"id": 22, "label": "unknown", "text": "principal diagnosis : thoracoabdominal aneurysm . associated diagnosis : hypertension . principal procedure : 2/17/94 : resection and grafting of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm . history : the patient is a 74 year old female who was involved in a motor vehicle accident on 11/18/93 at which time her workup revealed a large thoracoabdominal aneurysm at the eifro medical center which was evaluated with a chest x-ray and abdominal ct scan . at that time the patient denied any symptoms of aneurysmal pain and did not suffer significant injury from her motor vehicle accident . she was subsequently referred to dr. riode zetllille for evaluation and workup of her aneurysm . the patient underwent a thoracic abdominal arteriogram on 12/31/93 via a right femoral approach and she was noted to have a large descending aorta with tortuosity but no aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta . the patient was discharged after the procedure was performed and subsequently admitted in this hospitalization for elective resection . since the patient 's last admission she gives no history of chest or back pain and continues to be quite active . physical examination : on physical examination she is a well developed female in no distress . her head and neck examination is within normal limits . her lungs were clear to auscultation . her lung and pericardic examination is regular rate and rhythm . her abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended . she has a pulsatile upper abdominal mass . extremities : are well perfused and she has a small left inguinal hernia . she has a well healed right groin scar and pulse examination reveals 2 plus pulses from the carotids through the posterior tibial arteries bilaterally . neurologically she is awake and alert , she has normal cranial nerve function and her motor examination is within normal limits . laboratory data on admission : is remarkable for normal serum electrolytes with creatinine 1.2 , hematocrit 31.9 and normal coagulation studies . ekg reveals a normal sinus rhythm , normal intervals with slight left ventricular hypertrophy repolarization abnormality . her chest x-ray is remarkable only for a tortuous aorta on the anterior projection . hospital course : the patient was admitted and underwent resection and grafting of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm which she tolerated well . there were no intraoperative complications . she was taken to the surgical intensive care unit postoperatively . the patient 's procedure was also remarkable for the fact that she underwent spinal cooling during this procedure . the patient remained intubated postoperatively . she had a stable first postoperative day without evidence of hemodynamic or cardiopulmonary deterioration . on postoperative day 1 she had a slight hematocrit drop to 27.2 which was expected with hydration in addition to intraoperative volume loss but otherwise had an unremarkable course . epidural anesthesia was used throughout her course for pain management and she was transferred to the surgical floor on postoperative day two . the patient developed an episode of atrial fibrillation with physical examination consistent with only mild cardiopulmonary congestion as manifested by bilateral scattered rales in the lung fields . serum electrolytes at the time revealed normal potassium levels and the patient was treated with p.r.n. verapamil and digoxin therapy for a heart rate varying between 80 and 110 . the patient 's oxygen saturations continued to maintain at levels greater than 95 percent and this was felt to be well controlled and she was placed on digoxin chronically and also diuresed for therapy . she was transferred to the surgical floor where on postoperative day three she began to complain of hypersensitivity in the left lower extremity and inability to move her toes . this was a new finding considering postoperatively she had full motor and sensory function of all four extremities . neurologic assessment at the time did in fact reveal profound paresis of the left lower extremity only with absent reflexes but hyperesthesia to light touch throughout the lower extremities . laboratory data obtained revealed no significant changes from her initial postoperative levels . neurological consultation was obtained . it was felt that the patient had been subjected significant cord ischemia and possibly this neurologic event also related to spinal or epidural catheter placement . the epidural catheter had been removed prior to their evaluation and no return of significant function was noted over the ensuing two days aside from flexion and extension of the toes but still the patient maintained profound proximal lower extremity weakness . mri obtained did not reveal evidence of a structural cause for cord or root dysfunction and further recommendation of abdominal ct scanning in addition to emgs and sseps to further evaluate and confirm the site of the lesion be performed . the patient continued to do well otherwise being slowly progressed in her diet and mobilized from bed to chair without difficulty . she was placed on a bowel regimen to alleviate signs and symptoms of constipation while the workup to determine the exact etiology of her left lower extremity paresis could be identified . continued supportive care was performed for the patient as again she manifested no other significant signs of hemodynamic or neurologic deterioration . her ultimate diagnosis was subsequently felt to be a segmental infarction of the anterior and lateral part of her t10 level spinal cord and there was no evidence of that recovery of her left lower extremity would be obtained . social service consultation for rehabilitation placement was performed . the patient understands the ramifications of her disability and continued neurologic assessment is to be made . the patient continued to make slight gains in motor movement of the left lower extremity as manifested by digital function and some knee jerk return and by postoperative day eight she was manifesting some dorsiflexion in addition to urodynamics being performed revealed good detrusion contraction , normal sensation and a coordinated sphincter which suggested no disability to the sympathetic control of her bowel and bladder . the patient complained of some urinary incontinence and urgency on the 10th postoperative day . she was placed on bactrim therapy for e. coli positive urine culture and emg performed revealed a lesion proximal in the central nervous system ( cns ) consistent with central lesions . additional neurological follow-up will be maintained as the patient continues to rehabilitate in the on modenyheatl rowbrook of medical center . it is at this point encouraging that she continues to slowly regain some motor function of the left lower extremity but the patient has been advised that this may in fact not return . condition on discharge : is satisfactory . discharge diagnosis : (1) status post thoracoabdominal aneurysm grafting and resection . complications : during this hospitalization include left lower extremity paresis as well as e. coli urinary tract infection . discharge medications : lopressor 25 mg po b.i.d. , dulcolax tablets 2 po q.a.m. , dulcolax suppository 1 po q.o.d. , digoxin

kotereef is a 93-year-old woman who was transferred from daleglo medical center with renal insufficiency . the patient was in her usual state of health until 7/10/98 when she was admitted to the daleglo medical center with a chief complaint of falling and mental status changes . she was initially treated for heart failure and pneumonia and , on the night of admission , she experienced a fever to 104 , acute respiratory distress and required intubation for two days . the patient was noted to have a cpk of 150 with 11.8 percent mb but no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes . she was treated for congestive heart failure and was diuresed and extubated . she was transferred to the floor where initially she did very well but subsequently developed an elevated bun and creatinine and failure to eat . the patient 's granddaughter requested that she be transferred to the ph university of medical center where she had been cared for in the past for her myocardial infarction as well as cerebrovascular disease . past medical history : her past medical history is notable for congestive heart failure with a last ejection fraction noted to be 28 percent in april of 1997 . she also has a history of urinary tract infection . she has a history of diverticulosis with lower gi bleeds . in 01/95 she was admitted with a cerebral vascular accident notable for right facial droop and left-sided weakness . there was marked improvement in these symptoms thereafter , and the patient was discharged on coumadin which was subsequently discontinued . the patient also has a history of myocardial infarction in 1977 and 1987 and underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting x4 in 1987 . she also has a history of polymyalgia rheumatica with a bilateral temporal artery being biopsied and being negative for temporal arteritis . she also has a history of right proximal femur fracture and internal fixation in 1995 . on arrival to the ph university of medical center the patient stated that she had not had a bowel movement for many days and that she had no appetite . however , she denied any chest pain , dyspnea or syncope . physical examination : on physical examination her pulse was 55 . her systolic blood pressure was 110 . she appeared to be very dry with very dry mucosa . her lungs had few rhonchi , no rales . her cardiac exam was irregular but her heart sounds were distant . her abdomen showed active bowel sounds , was nontender and she had no pedal edema . laboratory data : laboratory data was notable for hematocrit of 33.5 , white count of 14.7 , platelet count of 270 . bun 112 , creatinine 2.3 , sodium 142 , potassium 4.2 , co2 23.4 , and chloride 104 . a chest x-ray revealed clear lungs on a portable chest x-ray without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema . a kub showed a large loop of dilated bowel but no free air and a tortuous calcified aorta . an electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of an old inferior myocardial infarction and right bundle branch block . hospital course and treatment : the patient was admitted to goman 25 where she was hydrated for the presumed diagnosis of pre-renal azotemia . a urinalysis was notable for pyuria with 50 to 100 white cells , and the patient was begun on levofloxacin for presumed polymicrobial urinary tract infection . a head ct scan was performed which showed multiple old ischemic infarcts in the right frontal and cerebellar lobes . there was diffuse atrophy and no evidence of recent bleed . the patient was evaluated by the rheumatology service who noted that the patient 's diagnosis was most consistent with rheumatoid arthritis and possibly pmr . the patient had been followed by dr. friednantflirt of the ph university of medical center . at that time she was noted to have undergone bilateral temporal artery biopsies , both of which were negative for temporal arteritis . the recommendation from the rheumatology service was to attempt to decrease her prednisone to 5 mg po q.day with an eye on a change in the severity of her shoulder arthritis symptoms . on the third hospital day the patient developed a sudden change in her mental status while taking pills . she was noted to be arousable and responsive and minimally conversation . however , she was unable to move her right arm or leg . her eyes were deviated to the left and she had a right facial droop . the patient was taken to the emergent cat scan which revealed no acute bleeding and was felt to be a cerebral vascular occlusion . the patient was evaluated by the stroke service , which recommended a lumbar puncture which was performed and did not reveal evidence of meningitis . a cardiac ultrasound was performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 50 percent with wall motion abnormalities in the inferior septal and inferior walls involving the apex . there was trace mitral regurgitation . multiple aortic valve leaflets were thickened without stenosis . there was no evidence of an intraventricular thrombus . the patient was initially treated by increasing her aspirin from 81 mg to 325 mg . she was also continued to be hydrated . her blood pressure medications were held to allow increased cerebral perfusion . after careful discussion with the neurology service , it was felt that the patient was at too great a risk to be started and maintained on anticoagulant therapy and therefore she was treated conservatively . the patient was subsequently evaluated by the speech pathology service , the physical therapy service and the occupational therapy service for evaluation for her recovery from her stroke . her bun and creatinine continued to decrease with hydration and zestril was re-initiated and , as her blood pressure allowed , her isordil was re-initiated and then her zestril was increased to 10 mg po q.day . digoxin was discontinued because of her improved left ventricular ejection fraction . the patient did have a steady decrease in her hematocrit to a minimum of 26.2 and received one unit of packed red blood cells with restoration of her hematocrit over 30 . her ferritin was 83 and there was no evidence of guaiac positive stools . it was elected to defer further evaluation of her anemia at this time . however , if she became more evidently guaiac positive it would be appropriate to evaluate the source of bleeding in her colon and potentially in her esophagus and stomach . nevertheless , the patient was switched from aspirin to plavix 75 mg po q.day in view of her history of lower gi bleeding . major consideration toward the end of the patient 's hospitalization was whether or not she would be able to take adequate po intake to maintain her volume status . initially it was felt that the patient would require gastroscopy . however , with the assistance of the patient 's granddaughter , the patient was able to increase her po intake with a lot of assistance . the patient 's granddaughter felt that it was likely that her po intake would improve when she returned home to the nursing home . i discussed this with the granddaughter and told her that if her po intake was inadequate , that gastrostomy tube would be reasonable in the future and that we would be available to assist in this as it became necessary . the patient was evaluated by the gi service who thought that a peg would be quite feasible

ph university of medical center which revealed an occluded right coronary artery with distal filling via left to right collaterals , a large left anterior descending with a 40-50% proximal stenosis and a co-dominant left circumflex with mild disease . he subsequently had an echocardiogram in december 1994 which showed normal left ventricular size and systolic function . he subsequently had an adenosine sestamibi in february 1997 which was negative for ischemia or infarction . in december 1994 he had a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia presenting with palpitations . he was diagnosed with wolfe parkinson white syndrome . he underwent an electrophysiology study which identified an accessory pathway with multiple attempts at ablation by dr. slusslashgodle which were unsuccessful . he was treated with sotalol for the supraventricular tachycardia . on 9/2/98 he was admitted to cay memorial hospital of with palpitations and was found to have an irregular wide complex tachycardia thought to be due to atrial fibrillation and conduction down his accessory pathway . he had mild congestive heart failure and was treated with an increased dose of lasix . an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 50% and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation . he was discharged home but returned on 9/13/98 with worsening palpitations on and off . he was again found to be in a wide complex tachycardia and was treated with magnesium . he denied any associated chest pain or dyspnea and he ruled out for a myocardial infarction . he continued to have intermittent runs of the wide complex tachycardia and was therefore transferred to ph university of medical center for further evaluation and management . prior to transfer he did have one episode of chest pain during the

heart failure and chest pain a cardiac catheterization was indicated prior to proceeding to an electrophysiology study . his initial cardiac catheterization had to be postponed given the possibility of an allergy to prednisone . he was seen by nnoatal hospital center who felt that he could be safely treated with solumedrol rather than prednisone together with benadryl and the use of low ionic contrast medium . accordingly the patient underwent uneventful cardiac catheterization on 9/17/98 which revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25 and a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 20 . his right coronary artery was occluded and filled distally via left to right collaterals . he had a 50% proximal left anterior descending stenosis and only minor disease to the left circumflex . his left ventriculogram showed preserved systolic function and mild mitral regurgitation . the patient then underwent an electrophysiology study on 9/20/98 . there was no inducible supraventricular tachycardia but he did have evidence of a left lateral bypass tract . mapping of the mitral anulus confirmed the location of the bypass tract . radiofrequency ablation was applied there and resulted in the elimination of the preoperatively-excitation . there were no complications . following the procedure there was no further evidence of wide complex tachycardia . he still did have occasional short runs of atrial tachycardia but there were no associated palpitations . in following up his ablation he underwent a holter monitor which showed normal sinus rhythm at rates of 40 to 80 . there were 15 atrial runs the longest of which was 13 beats at a rate of 100 . he also underwent a post-procedural echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 61% with mild mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement at 45mm . following the procedure his qt interval was noted to be prolonged to approximately .55 seconds . his sotalol was therefore decreased to 120 mg bid and his qt and qtc intervals decreased to .45-.48 seconds . after the procedure he was started on heparin and loaded on coumadin for a period of the next 3-4 weeks following radiofrequency ablation . his inr was 2.3 prior to discharge and he was scheduled to follow-up with the anticoagulation clinic to follow his coumadin dose . finally , his dementia appeared to worsen following receiving medications for agitation during his ep study . accordingly he was seen by neurology who felt that there was no evidence of a secondary process . he did have a head ct which showed no evidence of a bleed or stroke . finally , his blood pressure had trended up during his hospitalization particularly with the decreased dose of sotalol . given his occasional sinus bradycardia his atenolol was not advanced but instead his zestril dose was increased from 10-20 mg bid and his blood pressure responded appropriately . condition on discharge : he was discharged in stable condition on 9/23/98 . he will have a visiting nurse to see him on iat . follow-up : he will follow-up with dr. taarnna service at ph university of medical center as well as dr. lupevickette folk and dr. dwainco rallsversgach

{"id": 59, "label": "non-smoker", "text": "principal diagnoses : 1 ) thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura . 2 ) bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia . 3 ) renal failure requiring chronic dialysis . history of present illness : the patient is a 63 year-old woman transferred from pre health on june 19 , 1998 to the verg medical center intensive care unit for evaluation of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia . on may 12 , 1998 , the patient presented to pre health with fever , cough , dyspnea and a chest x-ray revealing a patchy infiltrate in the right lung . she was treated with clindamycin and erythromycin which were changed to trovan and then transferred to a hospital . on may 27 , 1998 , the patient desaturated to 40% with a temperature of 100.5 degrees . her oxygen saturations improved to only 92% on 100% face mask and she was admitted to pre health intensive care unit . chest x-ray there revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with increasing pleural effusion . a vq scan was high probability , but no pulmonary angiogram was done and an echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricle with no wall motion abnormality and an ejection fraction of 75% . on may 24 , 1998 , the patient had a ct scan of the chest which revealed diffuse alveolar infiltrates at the right base , mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions . at this point , a diagnosis of lupus was considered and her ana was 1:640 and her rheumatoid factor and anca were negative . she was started on a steroid trial at that point . her pleural fluid was tapped and it was negative for malignancy . on june 11 , 1998 , the patient had a video assisted thoracoscopic study of the right lung which revealed chronic interstitial pneumonitis with a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia-like reaction and a chest tube was placed . the patient was then started on 40 mg of prednisone q. day . from may 27 , 1998 through june 19 , 1998 , the patient had a decline in her platelets from 394 to 28 with a stable hematocrit of 32 to 33 and a rise in creatinine from 1.0 to 3.8 . on june 19 , 1998 , she was transferred to the verg medical center medical intensive care unit for evaluation of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura . past medical history : 1 ) cerebrovascular accident in 1995 in the pontine region secondary to hypertension . 2 ) hypertension . 3 ) status post hysterectomy . 4 ) status post appendectomy . medications on transfer : 1 ) albuterol inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d. 2 ) lasix p.r.n. 3 ) prednisone 40 mg p.o. q. day . 4 ) inderal 40 mg p.o. q.i.d. 5 ) thiamine . 6 ) lasix p.r.n. 7 ) atrovent inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d. 8 ) folic acid . 9 ) premarin 0.625 mg p.o. q. day . 10 ) omeprazole 20 mg p.o. q. day . 11 ) insulin sliding scale . allergies : the patient had no known drug allergies . social history : the patient is divorced . she has two children . she recently retired as a clerical worker . she denies any tobacco . she has only social alcohol use . family history : father died at age 56 of coronary artery disease . mother died at age 68 of pancreatic carcinoma . brother has coronary artery disease . there is no family history of hematologic problems . laboratory : laboratory studies on admission were notable for a sodium of 131 , potassium 6.2 , bun 111 , creatinine 3.9 , white blood cell count 23 , hematocrit 27 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on the smear , platelet count 92 and ldh 496 . hospital course : 1 ) bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia : the video assisted thoracoscopic study at the outside hospital was consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia . the patient was continued on steroids throughout the course of her stay . this was changed to solu-medrol part way through the course due to her hematologic problems , see below . by discharge , she was returned to 40 mg of prednisone q. day times one month to be followed by a slow taper . the patient 's bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia appeared to improve slowly throughout her hospital course , however on july 12 , 1998 , after starting dialysis ( see below ) , the patient desaturated and required supplemental oxygen . repeat chest x-rays and chest ct scans appeared consistent with pulmonary edema from volume overload given her renal failure and eventually , the patient 's pulmonary status did improve after significant volume removal with dialysis for several weeks . at the time of her discharge , the patient was still requiring two liters of supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations in the mid 90% . 2 ) thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura : the patient was initially admitted with platelet count of 28 , hematocrit of 32 , ldh of 496 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on her smear . this was felt to be consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and on june 20 , 1998 , she was started on daily plasma exchange which continued through july 27 , 1999 . she was also changed to intravenous solu-medrol 50 mg q. day which was changed back to 40 mg of prednisone prior to discharge . her platelet count initially rose to a maximum of 159 on july 3 , 1998 , then they steadily fell to a low of 60 on july 20 , 1999 . her ldh which peaked at 1255 decreased to the mid 200s , but remained elevated . she continued to have a few schistocytes on her smear , but it was much decreased . the patient also required red blood cell transfusions , approximately two units every seven to ten days to maintain her hematocrit . eventually , her plasma exchange was tapered to a smaller and smaller dose each day and then discontinued altogether after july 27 , 1999 . after this , the patient 's platelet count rose to a maximum of 177 on discharge . it is felt that the patient 's thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has resolved . she will continue on her prednisone for one month as above for the bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia with a very slow taper . 3 ) renal : the patient presented in acute renal failure with a bun of 101 and a creatinine of 3.7 . throughout the month of june , she had a rising potassium phosphate and increasing volume overload with decreasing response to diuretics and she was finally initiated on dialysis with ultrafiltration on july 12 , 1998 . the opinion of the renal consult was that this was permanent and non-reversible renal failure since it did not improve with dialysis and the patient will continue on dialysis three times per week . she required approximately five liters of ultrafiltration fluid removal at each dialysis session due to her significant volume overload . during the course of her dialysis , she had a great improvement in her lower extremity edema and her oxygen saturation . 4 ) infectious disease : the patient had multiple line infections during her admission including a confirmed coag. negative staphylococcus line infection with positive blood cultures on june 23 , 1998 , july 4 , 1998 , july 8 , 1998 and july 9 , 1998 . the patient eventually had a left subclavian tesio catheter placed and a right brachial picc line placed on july 10 , 1998 which remained patent and uninfected . she received a full three week course of vancomycin and also received a three week course of ceftazidime . in addition , she had a fungal urinary tract infection treated with amphojel bladder irrigation , which was followed by a klebsiella urinary tract infection for which she received levofloxacin times fourteen days . she also received a fourteen day course of acyclovir which was begun on june 21 , 1998 for perianal lesions consistent with herpes simplex virus . she was also on fluconazole for some oral thrush which was inadvertently continued for a total of thirty days . the patient was also started on bactrim one double strength tablet q.o.d. as prophylaxis for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while on her high dose steroids . 5 ) rheumatology : the patient was admitted with a question of lupus given her ana of 1:640 although her rheumatoid factor and anca were negative . unfortunately throughout her admission , we were unable to test any more titers since she was receiving daily plasma exchange . a repeat ana , rheumatoid factor and anca may be repeated as an outpatient . follow-up : 1 ) the patient will follow-up with her primary care physician , dr. tamarg study , in arvus after she is discharged from rehabilitation . 2 ) the patient is being discharged to a hospital where she will receive onsite hemodialysis three times per week on monday , wednesday and friday . the nephrologist who will follow her there is dr. study . 3 ) the patient will continue to have her cbc , ldh , bilirubin , chem-7 and magnesium and calcium checked with each dialysis and the results will be faxed to dr. ian zineisfreierm , the hematology attending at fax number 751-329-8840 . 4 ) the patient will eventually need a permanent dialysis fistula . the left subclavian tesio which she has in place will last for several months in the mean time . she would like to arrange to have her fistula placed at pre health and the vascular surgeons there should be contacted regarding this . 5 ) the patient will need packed red blood cell transfusions with dialysis when her hematocrit falls below 26 . 6 ) the patient will continue her prednisone at 40 mg p.o. q. day times one month ( this was started on july 27 , 1999 ) and then she will begin a slow taper as guided by pulmonary . 7 ) the patient
