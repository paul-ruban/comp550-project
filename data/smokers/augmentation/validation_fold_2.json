interposition and jejunostomy . multiple bronchoscopies , chest tube insertion . history of present illness : the patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula . the patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 . she did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe . this may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present . bronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable . she underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in march through may of 1993 . she had been doing reasonably well until december of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids . a bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe . she has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then . a barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina . past

low collar incision without adenopathy or bruit . the lungs showed mild inspiratory wheeze and moderate expiratory wheezes . breath sounds are present bilaterally . cardiovascular exam : regular rate and rhythm . the abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended . extremities : no clubbing , cyanosis or edema . the rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool . hospital course : the patient was admitted on february 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian . the patient was brought to the operating room on february 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy . findings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus . esophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea . her steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the operating room on february 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy . she then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy . the pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration . she remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the respiratory intensive care unit . the patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included vancomycin , ceftazidime and gentamicin . on postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing . the patient was seen in consultation by the neurology service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking . an endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis . she received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet . the patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator . a repeat echocardiogram on february 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on february 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion . a pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on february 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess . she remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics . her chest x-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome . she suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity . her steroids were weaned . because of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on february 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed . she remained in a coma . the blood cultures on february 26 , 1994 grew out staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia . her sputum grew out pseudomonas aeruginosa as well . the urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin . on march 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections . there was a large left pleural effusion however . this was drained with a left chest tube . her sputum then grew out klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem . she developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed . on march 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness . she was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands . on march 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed . attempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and fentanyl . this was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean . she continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's . she also fell into a coma once again . on march 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes . on april 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation . discussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery . she had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of jose pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones . decision was made in conjunction with the family and dr. caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support . the patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a t-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics . her respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on april 2 , 1994 . disposition / plan on discharge : the family will return the body to sa for burial . they have declined a post-mortem examination . ca shuff , m.d. dictating for : riemind caslighlourdes , m.d. tr : yu / bmot dd : 4-2-94

may 1998 with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , hypothyroidism and iron deficiency anemia . in late may of 1998 , she fell in the bath tub and had a small avulsion fracture of the left elbow . one month later she presented to an outside hospital complaining of pain in her right hip . a ct scan performed there demonstrated gas in the subcutaneous soft tissues . she was begun on cefazolin and flagyl . a surgical consultation was obtained and she was taken to the operating room for a wide debridement of the right hip distally through the right knee on the lateral and anterior aspects of the right thigh . on july 13 , 1998 , she was transferred from his outside hospital post debridement to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital for further care and management of her wound . past medical

left lung with scattered nodules in the right upper lung . these nodules are confirmed by chest ct and demonstrated to be smaller than 3 millimeter peripheral nodules appearing in both lung apices . the ct also demonstrated questionable right hepatic hemangioma and multiple tubular hypodensities were hepatic veins should be . hospital course and treatment : because of the extensiveness of ms. abreun 's hospital course it will be organized by system : 1. neurological : on admission the patient was intubated and sedated . her sedation was gradually weaned during her first month in the intensive care unit and she was noted to have an underlying depression and history of obsessive compulsive disorder as listed from the patient and her family . a psychiatric evaluation was obtained and she was placed on paxil at 5 milligrams which was gradually increased to a total of 20 milligrams po q day at the time of her admission . on august 29th , ms. abreun again required sedation when she found apneic and hypotensive . she spent several days in the intensive care unit at that time , during which her sedation was gradually weaned back to off . 2. pulmonary : ms. abreun was admitted , sedated and on a respirator , requiring minimal settings with a pressure support of 10 and a pep of 5 . after two weeks of intubation on july 25th the patient went to the operating room for a tracheostomy which she tolerated without issue . over the next several weeks , the ventilatory support was gradually weaned to off . by august 9th she was tolerating trach mask trials and was on the verge of tracheostomy removal by august 29th . at this time , she had a sudden episode of respiratory distress accompanied by hypotension and unresponsiveness . she was bag masked and taken immediately to the intensive care unit where she was placed on respiratory support with simv settings which were gradually weaned over the course of her ten days in the intensive care unit . after her wean from the respiratory , she was transferred back to the floor and over the next several days tolerated trach mask trials admirably and had her tracheostomy removed on september 16th , 1998 . at the time of her discharge , she had no acute respiratory issues . 3. cardiovascular : ms. abreun was admitted on cardiac support requiring 30 of neo-synephrine . she was placed on a swan gans catheter monitor and gradually weaned off the neo-synephrine by the 22nd of july . she required no further support and had no further issues until august 29th when she had her respiratory crisis and was transferred to the unit . at this time her dramatic pressure drop required dopamine support at levels of 500 micrograms per minute . a swan gans catheter floated at this time demonstrated an svr of 500 . she was supported with dopamine and with fluid and was slow to come off the dopamine requiring approximately 8 to 10 days for full weaning . after the wean she required no further cardiac medication and had no further issues . 4. renal : ms. abreun 's fluid management was an important contributor to her hospital course . she presented with massive ascites and anasarca for which she received large volume diuresis with regular lasix dosing daily . renal parameters were normal until the time of her respiratory cardiovascular crisis on august 29th . at this time , it was noted that her bun jumped to levels of approximately 80 , while her creatinine stayed at levels of .6 to .7 . an elevation by dr. freiermthalskush of renal medicine at first suspected a subclinical congestive heart failure as being responsible for a prerenal azotemia , however on further elucidation of the patient 's course , it is evident that a broad sepsis caused by her pneumonia was responsible for her decreased svr and eventual renal hypoperfusion . her azotemia responded readily to pressor support and fluid resuscitation . at the end of her second intensive care unit admission , her bun and creatinine had resolved to normal values . 5. gastrointestinal : ms. abreun was admitted nothing by mouth , intubated on intravenous fluids alone . she was immediately begun on total parenteral nutrition therapy for what would be a prolonged course without po intake . on july 25th a g tube was placed and feeds were begun gradually . these g tube feeds were gradually increased with a total parenteral nutrition wean , however at the time of her re-admission to the intensive care unit on august 29th aspiration was suspected and all tube feeds were held . she was maintained on total parenteral nutrition for the course of her time in the intensive care unit . at the end of this time , she was begun gradually on g tube feeding , however she was able to tolerate only very small volumes and produce large aspirates . this problem had remained and been ongoing for the remainder of her hospital at fairm of ijordcompmac hospital . she is currently being supported on tube feeds of vivonex at a rate of approximately 20 and hour with aspirates being measured q 4 hours and measuring from 30 to 250 regularly . she has also been supplemented with glutamine 10 grams b.i.d. via the g tube in hopes of reviving what most certainly be her gut atrophy from prolonged disuse . ms. abreun , from the onset of her stay at fairm of ijordcompmac hospital demonstrated elevated alkaline phosphatase levels in isolation from her other liver function tests . these values ranging as high as 2300 were evaluated by gastrointestinal consult who came and performed and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which demonstrated a normal biliary system with diameters on the large end of normal . stone was demonstrated in the gallbladder , but there was no evidence of obstruction and the study was ready as normal . 5 'nucleotidase values have also been elevated ranging from 150 to 180 . to date there has been no satisfactory explanation for these elevations in alkaline phosphatase and 5 'nucleotidase and all associated studies have been negative . further evaluation of this during her later hospital stay or as an outpatient . 6. infectious disease : ms. abreun underwent a work up for tuberculosis at the beginning of her hospital course . she ruled out by ppd . the initial management of her necrotizing fascitis was empiric with imipenem , flagyl and vancomycin . because of the extent of her wound , she was also treated with hyperbaric oxygen which was of some benefit in resolving her infection . the course of flagyl , imipenem and vancomycin was continued for fourteen days . at this time imipenem were discontinued and vancomycin was maintained alone for additional several days . she then went without antibiotic therapy for a period of several weeks until her crisis of august 29th . on admission to the unit , she was begun on triple antibiotic therapy with levo / vanc/flagyl . shortly thereafter gentamicin was added to the regimen which was maintained for a period of one week until cultures came back and her therapy could be stream lined to vancomycin , levofloxacin alone . after a ten day course of levofloxacin it was discontinued , vancomycin was maintained for five additional days , after which time , it was discontinued as well and she was without antibiotics . on discharge , she was currently taking no antibiotics . ms. abreun entered the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital having taking only oral hypoglycemic agents for control of her diabetes . because of the stress of her infection and intensive care unit admission she was requiring sliding scale insulin for the full course of her hospital stay . her total parenteral nutrition was also supplemented with insulin nph for better control . her total parenteral nutrition is currently supplemented with 30 units nph q day and she is on a sliding scale to control the remainder of her sugars . ms. abreun 's hypothyroidism diagnosed shortly before her admission was an important aspect of her therapy during her course at fairm of ijordcompmac hospital . her thyroid necessity was poorly controlled with a synthroid dose of 0.125 milligrams for the majority of her stay . at the time of her admission to the intensive care unit on august 29th it was noted that she had a thyroid stimulating hormone that was dramatically raised to a value of 26.83 . more active supplementation was performed increasing her dose to .3 milligrams q day , which caused a rapid resolution of her thyroid studies and an improvement in her physiology almost immediately . she has since been maintained on a dose of 0.2 milligrams iv q d . however , she has had a gradual rise in her thyroid stimulating hormone to a value of 6.68 . her discharge medication will include synthroid dose of 0.3 milligrams po q day with recommendation that this parameter be followed closely . in summary : ms. abreun is a fifty nine-year-old female who presented with necrotizing fascitis of the right hip , status post debridement , severely debilitated by the extent of her infection . over the course of 2 months this infection was cleared , the wound was cleaned and split thickness skin grafting was successful in covering over the wound . her course , however was complicated by an methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was resistant to therapy and which produced a profound sepsis which caused a hypotensive ana apneic episode which required intensive care unit support for a period of a week . her course was also complicated by her hypoactive thyroid function which went unrecognized for some period , but has since resolved with aggressive synthroid therapy . currently , her most issues are the advancement of her tube feeds and the restarting of her po intake which was planned to begin for the next several days before her transfer was initiated . her wound also requires further care as smaller areas of non-take in the graft are being management with sterile saline wet to dry dressings . condition on discharge : stable with issues resolving . medications on discharge : heparin 5,000 units sub q b.i.d. prilosec 20 milligrams per g tube q day . paxil 10 milligrams per g tube q.h.s. milk of magnesia 30 ccs per g tube q.h.s. lotrimin cream b.i.d. to effected areas . nystatin powder b.i.d. to effected areas . lasix 20 milligrams intravenous q day . synthroid 0.3 milligrams per g tube q day . reglan 10 milligrams per g tube t.i.d. peri-colace 15 ccs per g tube q.h.s. glutamine 10 grams diluted as necessary per g tube t.i.d. ativan 0.5 milligrams to 1 milligrams per g tube or sublingual q 6 hours whenever necessary . insulin sliding scale as follows ; 0 to 70 call house officer , 70 to 200 no insulin , 201 to 250 2 units of insulin , 251 to 300 4 units of insulin , 301 to 350 6 units of insulin , 351 to 400 8 units of insulin , 401 or above 10 units of insulin and call house officer . the patient is also receiving total parenteral nutrition as designed by the nutritional services at fairm of ijordcompmac hospital . instructions : dressing changes with sterile saline wet to dry guaze bandages on areas of breakdown on the graft . the patient is currently nothing by mouth and will require a modified barium swallow before beginning po feeds . physical therapy and occupational therapy to work with patient daily in improving activity and working toward ambulation . disposition : follow up with primary care physician dr. vontha elkszuk , phone number ( 644 ) 075-7150 . sta bodejove , m.d. dictating for : rey caffefalmyoretland , m.d. tr : ug dd :

(1) pneumonia . he was admitted for a pneumonia unresponsive to antibiotics for five days . the pneumonia was found to be multilobar , and accompanied by significant hypoxia . he was started on broad spectrum coverage , including ceftriaxone , clindamycin , and ciprofloxacin . the ration off for the utilization of the ciprofloxacin , was that because of his allergy to erythromycin , an alternative regimen was needed to cover for legionella , which was probably the leading diagnosis at the time of admission , because of his hyponatremia accompanied by liver function abnormalities . however , he was isolated , and three afb smears were obtained , in order to rule out tuberculosis . in addition , sputum induction was performed for pneumocystis , which was negative . his urinary legionella antigen subsequently came back negative . however , this test is only 85-95% sensitive for legionella pneumophila , type i , which is the subtype that causes some 80% of legionnaires disease . however , the legionella antigen is neither sensitive , nor specific , for other legionella species that may be involved in legionella pneumonia . therefore , the ciprofloxacin was continued . in addition , his sputum cultures were all negative , as of the day of admission . after admission , with the initiation of antibiotic therapy , mr. cliffestreukote remained quite hypoxic . however , within one to two days after admission , he defervesced with a significant decrease in his cough during the week , post admission . because of persistent hypoxemia on room air , as well as nasal cannula , some concern was raised about the possibility of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , versus some other lesion that may predispose him for persistent hypoxemia , ( i.e. malignancy ) . therefore , an evaluation by the pulmonary team of the tonwe hospital , as well as a sputum cytology and chest ct scan , were all obtained . the chest ct scan revealed evidence for emphysematous changes of his lungs , as well as the previously noted right pneumonia , with several pseudo abscesses noted in infected bullae . his sputum cytology is pending at the time of discharge . the pulmonary team felt that the patient exhibited significant physical findings , laboratory values , and radiologic features , all consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . therefore , his persistent hypoxemia may be secondary to that underlying disease . despite being afebrile , with significant decrease in his cough , mr. cliffestreukote will be maintained , after discharge , on eleven more days of antibiotic therapy , to complete a full course . it should be noted , that clindamycin was discontinued , approximately three days after admission , because of the development of diarrhea . additionally , when switched to oral medication , mr. cliffestreukote was switched to augmentin 500 mg. p.o. t.i.d. , as well as continuing on his ciprofloxacin 150 mg. p.o. b.i.d. (2) hypertension . while in the hospital , mr. cliffestreukote was maintained on hydrochlorothiazide , and verapamil sr , and required no additional medication . (3) hyponatremia . while in the hospital , persistent type of natremia was noted on the patient 's profile 7 labs . it was felt that this was due largely to his pulmonary disease , and would resolve with the resolution of his intrapneumonic process . while in the hospital , there were no complications . discharge medications : augmentin 500 mg. p.o. t.i.d. for eleven more days , ciprofloxacin 750 mg. p.o. b.i.d. for eleven days , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. p.o. q. day , verapamil sr 240 mg. p.o. q. day , and atrovent meter dose inhaler two puffs four times a day . disposition : his condition on discharge was stable . he was discharged to home . he has a followup appointment with dr. naaan jesc , in the tonwe hospital pulmonary clinic on 2-18-95 , at 9:45 a.m. , as well as with his primary care physician , dr. rybam selcjescpint . his estimated disability is mild . we are still awaiting the results of his hiv testing . dictated by : nasa linkeweertsjescleask , m.d. co23 attending : rybam t. selcjescpint , m.d. on57 rp221/7499 batch : 9144 index no. wgrd2l3hee d : 10/27/94 t : 10/27/94 cc : 1. rybam t. selcjescpint , m.d. 2. nasa linkeweertsjescleask , m.d.

{"id": 7, "label": 0, "text": "principal diagnosis : (1) stage iiic ovarian carcinoma . secondary diagnoses : (1) right lower lobe pneumonia . (2) failure to thrive ; (3) obstructive uropathy . identifying data and chief complaint : mrs. saujule t. neathe is a 73 year old gravida 6 para 4 abortions 2 with a background history of stage iiic papillary serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary who presents on 5/30/94 for failure to thrive , right lower lobe pneumonia and obstructive uropathy . history of present illness : the patient was diagnosed with ovarian carcinoma in the summer of 1992 when she presented with abdominal distention . at that time she was taken to the operating room and an ileostomy and colectomy performed . the admission was complicated by the development of a right calf deep venous thrombosis on postoperative day four . the patient was referred then to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital where she underwent thrombectomy . one month later the patient was readmitted to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital for definitive debulking including total abdominal hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy , omentectomy , splenectomy and ileostomy take-down by dr. slaineaee chabechird . thereafter she underwent line 1 chemotherapy with cis platinum , vp16 which she received six cycles and which was completed in march of 1993 . this course of chemotherapy was complicated only by persistent diarrhea and some nausea and vomiting . on 4/28/94 the patient developed a left femoral deep venous thrombosis requiring admission for anticoagulation . an abdominopelvic computerized tomography scan during that admission showed recurrent disease in the pelvis with bilateral hydronephrosis . bilateral ureteric stents were placed prior to discharge . two days following discharge , however , the patient was admitted to sephsandpot center because of a decreased urinary output and persistent nausea and vomiting and anorexia . she was maintained on intravenous fluids and received a transfusion of prilosec which helped her urinary obstruction . on this regimen she showed good improvement and was discharge home . she was then seen on 5/30/94 at fairm of ijordcompmac hospital for a routine chemotherapy but complained of decreased urinary output , nausea and vomiting and poor appetite and was therefore admitted . past medical history : is as detailed above . past surgical history : she is also status post appendectomy in 1944 and dilation and curettage in 1945 . allergies : she is allergic to shellfish . drug allergies : she has no known drug allergies . medications on admission : include coumadin 2.5 mg. p.o. q.h.s. , omeprazole 20 mg. p.o. q.d. , m.v.i. one tablet p.o. q.d. , ferrous sulfate 325 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , ativan .5 mg. p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. for sleep and tylenol no. 3 one to two tablets p.o. 4 hourly for pain . physical examination : ( on admission ) showed the patient to be low-grade febrile with temperature of 99.6 , vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 104/68 and a pulse of 92 , respiratory rate 16 . she was noted to be a thin , cachectic woman in no apparent distress . head and neck examination remarkable only for extreme dry mucous membranes consistent with dehydration . she had slightly icteric sclera , no adenopathy or thyromegaly . lungs examination was unremarkable with no focal pathology , breasts were within normal limits . heart : regular rate and rhythm , no evidence of evidence , cardiac failure or endocarditis . abdomen : showed well healed midline scar , non-distended , non-tender , bowel sounds were good , multiple small nodules were palpated subcutaneously in the upper abdomen which was non-tender , there was no costovertebral angle tenderness . pelvic and rectal examinations confirmed recurrence of tumor mass in the pelvis . the patient was occult blood negative . extremities : showed no evidence of acute deep venous thrombosis . however , left leg had two plus pitting edema to the knee whereas the right leg had minimal edema . laboratory data : ( on admission ) showed sodium 119 , potassium 9.8 ( the specimen was hemolyzed ) bun and creatinine of 26 and 2.3 respectively , glucose 104 , alt was 13 , total bilirubin .5 , alkaline phosphatase 62 , white blood cell count was 17.7 , hematocrit 26.7 , platelet count 223,000 , prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were 22.1 and 37 respectively . i and r was 5.2. urinalysis showed no white blood cells and few bacteria . chest x-ray from 5/18/94 was within normal limits . in summary : the patient was assessed as a 72 year old woman with a background of stage iiic ovarian carcinoma and documented local recurrence who presents for line 2 of cycle 1 chemotherapy with adriamycin , ifex and mesna . she also has a low-grade fever of unknown etiology , has a background history of deep venous thrombosis and is therefore currently on anticoagulation and she shows evidence of dehydration and failure to thrive . it was decided at that time to hold off with the chemotherapy . hospital course : the patient was therefore admitted to the gyn / oncology service under the care of dr. chabechird . laboratory tests were repeated in view of some of the above abnormalities and was remarkable for sodium 138 , potassium 4.0 , bun and creatinine remained elevated at 36 and 2.8 respectively . urinalysis showed 10-20 white blood cells . in view of the nausea and vomiting a nasogastric tube was placed to which the patient some relief . repeat chest x-ray showed evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia . renal ultrasound was performed which showed moderate right and severe left hydronephrosis , bilateral ureteric stents were visualized . dr. ryna r. jescdrig from the urology service was consulted in view of the above findings . he requested a lasix renal nuclear medicine scan which showed high-grade obstruction of both kidneys , left greater than right and minimal clearance with lasix . neither kidney appeared to be completely obstructed . in view of these results with the elevated white blood count , elevated creatinine , dr. jescdrig felt that the patient was inadequately stented . as a result she was taken back to the operating room on 6/2/94 and under cystoscopy the old stents were removed and new larger stents were placed . the patient was started on ampicillin and gentamicin for urinary tract infection which ultimately grew out escherichia coli sensitive to the above antibiotics and for right lower lobe pneumonia on x-ray . she was started on nebulizers around-the-clock and chest physical therapy . sputum culture was sent but failed to identify an infective organism . on the above regimen the patient showed marked improvement . her urinary output remained good at 80-100 ccs. per hour . however , her bun and creatinine remained elevated . on 6/5/94 they were 21 and 2.2 respectively . her coumadin anticoagulation was adjusted to give a prothrombin time between 16 and 18 and an i and r of 2.5-3 . on june 5 , 1994 it was decided that mrs. neathe was not stable enough with a line 2 cycle i chemotherapy with ifex , adriamycin and mesna . she was therefore well hydrated and was started on her chemotherapy . in view of her kidney damage it was suggested to change her intravenous antibiotics from ancef and gentamicin to ancef and ciprofloxacin which she tolerated well . on 6/7/94 the patient was found to be mildly confused with persistent nausea and malaise . urinary electrolytes were noted to be within normal limits but her confusion persisted . a neuro-oncology consult was sought which felt this was probably secondary to ifex intoxication and her chemotherapy was stopped . an electroencephalogram was requested and was negative . no computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging study of the head was performed . she continued to have persistent nausea and vomiting with large amount of drainage through the nasogastric tube between 1200 and 1500 ccs. for 24 hours . off her ifex the patient 's sensorium slowly cleared but the nausea and vomiting persisted . for this reason a barium study was performed on 6/12/94 which showed a fixed stricture at the anastomosis of the descending colon with the rectum . the mucosa appeared to be preserved . in addition there was some narrowing in the mid portion of the descending colon . the patient 's white blood count which had been followed carefully began to drop precipitously on 6/11/94 and nadired down to 0.7 on 6/12/94 . the patient was placed on neutropenic precautions , her intravenous antibiotics were continued . her sensorium had cleared . because of persistent nausea and vomiting on june 13 , 1994 a kub and upright was requested which showed large amounts of retained barium confirming a rectosigmoid stricture approximately one centimeter in diameter . the patient 's white blood count persisted in the region of .5 to .6 with an anc of 60 for the next two to three days . in addition her platelets began to drop and reach a level on 6/13/94 . she was maintained on intravenous antibiotics and gcsf therapy was started because of the profound neutropenia . despite the low platelets the patient showed no evidence of active bleeding and was not transfused . a gastrograffin upper gastrointestinal was attempted on 6/14/94 but was unsuccessful due to nausea and vomiting . on conservative therapy the patient 's nausea and vomiting has slowly subsided . a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( peg ) tube was placed on june 18 , 1994 which has helped to decompress the stomach and prevent nausea and vomiting . on 6/17/94 in view of a drop in hematocrit to 25 , the patient was transfused three units of packed red blood cells , white count however had increased to 8.5 and her platelets were on their way up , count was 74,000 . and she was not given platelets in addition . throughout this period the patient 's pain remained well controlled on patient controlled analgesia . after much discussion with the family and social services it was decided to transfer the patient home once stable . on august 21 , 1994 a picc line was placed to facilitate home patient controlled analgesia ( pca ) and on 6/23/94 this was found to be correctly positioned on chest x-ray . on june 23 , 1994 the patient was found to be mobilizing relatively well with few episodes of nausea and vomiting . the peg tube was found to be draining well . she was discharged home in a stable condition into the care of her family . in addition she will be followed by sephsandpot center and dwardsc center who will arrange for home pca ( patient controlled analgesia ) . the patient 's prognosis is guarded . her current code status is do not resuscitate ( dnr ) . medications on discharge : include omeprazole 20 mg. p.o. q.d. , timoptic eye drops .5 percent one drop ou b.i.d. she will receive intravenous fluids d5 1/2 normal saline plus 20 of potassium at 110 ccs / hour at home and is going to be placed on a subcutaneous morphine pump as arranged by sephsandpot center . the patient may have liquids as tolerated but no solid foods . in addition she will be followed by santea gehawhi general hospital for peg tube care and flushing and to assess her pain control . follow-up : the patient will follow up with dr. chabechird on an out-patient basis . longkend sapshuff , m.d. dictating for : slaineaee s. niet chabechird , m.d. tr : suh / bmot dd :

anterior descending artery disease and diffuse left circumflex disease . an echocardiogram had revealed an ejection fraction of 41% with apicalakinesis . he had undergone electrophysiology study and his incessant ventricular tachycardia was interrupted by transcatheter radio frequency ablation . after the ablation procedure , programmed stimulation had initiated another ventricular tachycardia with distinct surface qrs configuration but since there was no spontaneous ventricular tachycardia , the other forms were not pursued vigorously . the patient was discharged while on procainamide and coumadin . on march 8 , he developed palpitations with shortness of breath and chest pain . the patient was admitted to an outside hospital in xingwa moineswest where a wide complex tachycardia with a

episodes of sustained and nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia . intravenous procainamide was started , which reduced the frequency and the duration of the ventricular tachycardia . on march 11 , the patient underwent an electrophysiology study . during the study , ventricular tachycardia with a cycle length of 510 milliseconds was reproducibly induced by extra stimuli delivered from the right ventricular apex . pace mapping studies had demonstrated that the origin of the tachycardia to be in the inferior , lateral and apical left ventricle . after mapping of the tachycardia , radio frequency ablation was carried out with four current applications , terminating the ventricular tachycardia in three of the four times . after radio frequency ablation , no sustained ventricular tachycardias occurred . however , there were periods of supraventricular tachycardias with a rate of 160-180 beats per minute and the patient was placed on sotalol . since the patient was known to have multiple different ventricular tachycardias , automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy was also offered to the patient . the patient agreed to proceed with automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy . on march 17 , the patient was taken to the pacemaker laboratory and a transvenous lead for the automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator ( cpi endotak c

was less than or equal to 20 joules on several consecutive attempts . the patient 's postoperative course was uneventful . on march 19 , the patient was taken back to the electrophysiology laboratory where noninvasive programmed stimulation and automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator testing were performed . under brief propafol anesthesia , rapid ventricular tachycardia was induced by ramp pacing . this was properly detected and converted to normal sinus rhythm with a single 34 joule countershock . three zones were programmed in the cardiac defibrillator . for tachycardias with heart rate between 110 and 140 beats per minute , no therapy was programmed . for tachycardias with heart rates between 140 and 175 , anti-tachycardia pacing followed by cardioversion is programmed . for

adverse drug reactions : none . clinical infections : none . history of present illness : mr. warm is an 83 year old man with chronic congestive heart failure , mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis who was admitted for diagnostic cardiac catheterization . over the last four to five months , mr. warm has noted a marked decline in functional capacity with nearly daily pnd and orthopnea . he has not experienced recent syncope but did have a syncopal episode in 1 resulting in implantation of a defibrillator . although in the past , he has been somewhat ambivalent with respect to cardiac surgery , given the decline in his functional capacity , he agreed to undergo repeat cardiac catheterization with a view towards defining his candidacy for cardiac surgery . the patient lives independently with his wife in connecticut and continues to be less and less active unfortunately . he has nearly curtailed his trips to a gymnasium for cardiopulmonary exercising . he does not drink alcohol and does not smoke cigarettes . physical examination on admission : on examination , the patient was an extraordinarily pleasant man who appeared his stated age . his blood pressure was 110/70 . heart was 82 and regular . respiratory rate was 16 . his jugular venous pressure was not elevated and his carotids were 2+ . lungs were notable for adequate air movement with no rales . the first and second heart sounds were physiologically split and the cardiac impulse was rather diffuse and inferiorly displaced . there was an s3 gallop at the apex and a 2/6 murmur of mitral regurgitation at the apex which radiated to the axilla . the abdomen was soft and nontender . there was no organomegaly but modest hepatojugular reflex . the extremities were without edema and were warm and well perfused . the posterior tibialis pulses were intact . laboratory data : sodium 140 , potassium 5.0 , bun 45 , creatinine 1.9 , glucose 90 . albumin 3.6 , hematocrit 41 , white count 8.6 , platelets 388 and pt 12.6 seconds . the chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly and no significant congestion . the ecg was paced . an outpatient echocardiogram revealed a left atrium of 45 mms. , an lv of 60 mms. , ejection fraction of 26% , moderate to severe mitral regurgitation by color and spectral doppler , aortic stenosis with a valve area of .8 cms. squared with a peak gradient of 50 , a mean gradient of 30 , an ejection fraction of 26% with diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis and more severe inferior hypokinesis . there was mild tricuspid insufficiency , an estimated rv peak systolic pressure of 55 and a mild diffuse hypokinesis of the right ventricle . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the hospital following uncomplicated cardiac catheterization that revealed a right atrial pressure of 5 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 23 , pulmonary artery pressure of 56/22 with a mean of 36 , a cardiac output of 6.1 liters per minute with a cardiac index of 3.8 liters per minute per meter squared . the aortic valve gradient was approximately 32 mms of mercury peak with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 cms. squared . coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the dominant right coronary artery in the proximal segment with distal reconstitution via left to right collaterals . left ventriculography revealed a dilated , diffusely and severe hypokinetic left ventricle with the anterior basilar wall best perfused and an ejection fraction of 18% . there was 3+ mitral regurgitation and reflux into the pulmonary veins in the ------ views . in addition , there was a 60% lesion in the left circumflex artery and only minimal irregularities in the left anterior descending itself . the patient tolerated the procedure well apart from a small rise in his creatinine to 2.3 which returned to his baseline value of approximately 1.7 to 1.9 at the time of discharge after holding his diuretics and his vasodilator medications . the patient was seen in consultation by dr. win shufffyfe of the cardiac surgery service and after a long discussion with the patient , dr. shufffyfe and the patient 's family , it was decided to defer cardiac surgery likely indefinitely and probably permanently given the patient 's age , co-morbidities , lack of probable benefit with relief of his mitral regurgitation , modest aortic stenosis and relatively modest coronary artery disease . while in hospital , the patient was seen by lenni breutzoln who felt that the incremental benefit from biventricular pacing was likely to be modest . the patient also underwent a sleep study which revealed evidence for fairly advanced and severe obstructive sleep apnea with multiple hypopneas and apneas , mean duration of which was approximately 30 seconds with one episodes of 68 seconds with a desaturation to 71% . the patient was fitted with a cpap apparatus with titration of 8-12 cms. of water as tolerated as an outpatient . in addition , the patient had oxygen therapy given his prominent desaturation at night . at the time of discharge , the patient 's vasodilator regimen had been winnowed appreciably and he was discharged with a goal weight of 125 lbs . he will be followed both by

at 53 with a normal axis , first degree atrioventricular block , biphasic t-waves in v1 to v3 without any acute changes . a chest x-ray shows left lower lobe consolidation . the head ct scan revealed a large right occipital infarct without midline shift , but positive mass effect on the temporal horn , on the right ventricle and some effacement of the sulci in the right parietal area . hospital course : the patient was admitted to a telemetry bed and started on heparin . around 4:00 am the next day , an acute decompensation in respiratory status was noted . lung examination at that point showed good air entry , no wheezing , coarse breath sounds throughout . neurologically , the patient was not following commands . eyes were closed . he was moving the right arm and leg spontaneously , though less than before . withdrawal to pain was still present . both plantars were upgoing . a blood gas at this point showed a ph of 7.49 , po2 61 , pco2 of 33 on 100% non-rebreather mask . ekg showed sinus tachycardia . the patient 's temperature was 102 degrees . a repeat cat scan of the head was performed . this showed continued evolution of the right posterior cerebral artery infarction now extending into the right cerebellar hemisphere . there was also a high density adjacent to the right cerebellar infarction suggesting the presence of hemorrhage . at this point , the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit . an mri and mra of the head was arranged to evaluate the extent of his stroke and the posterior circulation . the mri showed infarct of the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally , the right occipital lobe , the right thalamus and bilateral pons . the mra of the intracranial circulation demonstrated gross patency of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally and the basilar arteries . the left vertebral artery was not visualized . there was a dominant right vertebral artery . there was mildly reduced flow in the branches of the right middle cerebral artery compared to the left . there was visualization of flow within both posterior cerebral arteries . clinically , the patient continued to deteriorate . neurosurgery was consulted , however the neurosurgeons felt that there was no surgical option , since even in the case of cerebellar swelling , there would be no improvement from decompensation . the patient was therefore treated conservatively with fluid restriction and blood pressure management . heparin was discontinued because of the risk of intercerebral hemorrhage . the aspiration pneumonia was treated with cefotaxime and metronidazole . the patient 's family was involved and they decided to opt for dnr / dni in view of the poor prognosis . the patient passed away at 6:45 am on june 12 , 1998 . condition on

last stress test on 1/17/2005 showed that he could exercise for 9 minutes and then reached a peak heart rate of 99 on medication and a blood pressure of 150/100 , but he had shortness of breath and a posterolateral defect with some filling . he therefore was referred for cardiac catheterization . past medical history : his past medical history includes hypertension , elevated cholesterol , and a herniated disc . he also has had cataract repairs . family history : he has a strong family history with a father and an uncle having had coronary disease at a young age . social history : his social history is that he lives in lotyvall 1 , quera , minnesota with his wife second . he has four children . he is present in a capefrecam luhthousy . he does not drink and does not smoke . allergies : he is allergic to contrast dye having had hypotension and is premedicated with steroids . physical examination : on exam , he is 5 feet , 9 inches , and 160 pounds . his blood pressure is 130/75 . his pulse is 50 and regular . his neck veins are not distended . his head and neck exam is normal . his lungs are clear . his cardiac exam shows no murmurs or gallops . his abdomen is benign . his peripheral pulses are intact . his neurologic exam was nonfocal . he is fully oriented . laboratory data on admission : includes an electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with right bundle-branch block . hematocrit 43% , potassium 4.3 , and creatinine of 1.0 . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the cardiac cath laboratory . there , the native right coronary artery was occluded and the vein graft to the rv marginal and the right-sided pda was patent . the lad was occluded and the lima to the proximal lad was patent , but there was also a jump graft that went from the mid to the distal segment of the lad and that was also patent . the vein graft to the diagonal and circumflex was also patent and the ostial diagonal stent was also patent . the culprit territory was the distal left-sided pda coming off the circumflex and this had an 85% stenosis . this was a very small vessel and this was a tortuous segment and a long lesion . it was felt that this single lesion given the open distal right territory was not worth stenting and it was felt that he should be managed medically . left ventriculography showed inferior hypokinesis and anterolateral hypokinesis with preserved left ventricular function . he tolerated the procedure well . he was monitored for the day . he ambulated without difficulty . he was discharged home and will be followed closely by his physicians at sko gerb timp valley health and at middso memorial hospital 's . he will remain on beta blockers , ace inhibitors , statins , aspirin and plavix indefinitely . electronically signed iard tibelledie

his electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation . there were nonspecific st and t wave changes . hospital course : the patient was admitted to hellworthston hospital . there , he stabilized , and was seen in consultation by cardiology and anesthesiology . there was concern over his sleep apnea , but he appeared to have primarily cardiac disease and therefore because of the left main stenosis , it was reasonable to proceed . on june 24 , 1993 , dr. lenni breutzoln performed triple coronary bypass surgery . he placed a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , single saphenous vein to the posterior descending artery with 170 cc. per minute flow and a single saphenous vein to the circumflex with 140 cc. per minute flow . he weaned easily off cardiopulmonary bypass . he had no hemodynamic difficulties . he was able to wean from the ventilator , but he did have marginal oxygenation throughout . he did revert back to atrial fibrillation . he was extubated within forty eight hours . he was transferred out of the surgical intensive care unit on june 26 . he reverted back to atrial fibrillation that required digoxin , and verapamil to control . he could not be converted back to normal sinus rhythm even with a trial of quinaglute . he also had anemia and he was seen in consultation by the nutrition service . he was advised to have an ideal body weight of 178 pounds , and clearly a 2300 calorie diet was appropriate for him . weight reduction would be important in the long term management of his coronary disease . he was treated with digoxin and diuretics along with ace inhibitors because of his depressed left ventricular function . he was able to ambulate although somewhat slowly because of his rapid atrial fibrillation . it was considered to obtain a pulmonary consultation on a formal basis , but it was then felt that he would do better by healing fully from his surgery , because he really had little in the way of pulmonary complications , despite the history of sleep apnea of an obstructive basis . primary in his long term management is cardiac rehabilitation with weight reduction . he will be followed closely in 23 hwy , hamp by dr. laymie

spasticity , occasional difficulty swallowing and abdominal pain . she was originally admitted to the verg medical center in january , 1998 , because of a one year history of left sided weakness and spasticity . she was found to have intermedullary lesion at c1-2 level which on biopsy showed abnormal vasculature , hemosiderin deposit , leading in turn to the discovery of a dural arteriovenous malformation at that level which was surgically corrected . the postoperative period was complicated by transient swallowing difficulty , increasing left sided weakness and urinary retention . she was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation where she made significant progress toward recovery . as of the beginning of september , 1999 , she was able to swallow without difficulty , urinate without difficulty ( although bowel movements have been problematic ) . functionally , she was at the level of pre-gait training and able to stand and take several steps with upper body support . over the past 4-5 weeks her functional level has progressively deteriorated . she is now unable to stand and needs assistance to sit up . her left arm has developed a flexure contraction and she reports intermitttent pain in the left arm and leg which occurs both spontaneously and is also triggered by contact . she has developed some new swallowing difficulty and since her transfer to a long term inpatient care facility , she has lost ten pounds . she denies dysuria or excessive urinary frequency . over the past several weeks she has also developed severe intermittent abdominal pain , localized to the suprapubic area , left greater than right , occurring intermittently . the patient feels this is secondary to her hemorrhoids , although it does not clearly localize to the rectum . this pain often follows bowel movement but does occur spontaneously . past medical history : significant for insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , atrial fibrillation , hypothyroidism , hypertension ,

, heart is regular rate and rhythm without murmur . lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . abdomen is soft , with marked suprapubic tenderness and reduced bowel sounds . anal tone is reduced . rectal examination is nontender and stool is guaiac negative . neurologically , the patient is alert and oriented times three with normal speech , language and repetition . cranial nerves : pupils are 4-6 mm bilaterally , extraocular movements were full without nystagmus . eye closure and smile are symmetric . tongue is midline . facial sensation is sensation . strength : the tone is markedly increased in bot legs with left greater than right . left arm shows a flexor contracture and markedly increased tone . the right arm shows moderate increased tone . power : the left upper extremity shows reduction in motor power ranging from 2/5 in the triceps , 4/5 in the biceps , and 3-4/5 in the wrists and hand intrinsics . the right upper extremity shows generalized reduction in strength , 4/5 in all joints . in the lower extremities on the left hip flexor is 1/5 , knee flexion and extension is 3/5 and 4/5 respectively and plantar and dorsiflexion is 4/5 . the right lower extremity shows a 3/5 on hip flexion , 4/5 at knee flexion and extension and full power on dorsi and plantar flexion . reflexes : upper extremities are very brisk bilaterally and symmetrical 3+. there is positive tremor reflex on the left and absent on the right . lower extremities show patellar reflexes 3+ left , 4+ right , no cross deductor reflexes and absent ankle jerks . there is no clonus on the right but sustained clonus ( 10-12 beats ) on the left . plantar responses : toes are upgoing on the left , down going on the right . sensory : the patient has diminished vibration and propioception

and 1-2 mm reciprocal st depression in ii , iii , and f. on physical examination at that time he had bright red blood per rectum and therefore lysis was deferred and he was taken directly to the cardiac catheterization lab . the cardiac catheterization results at that time revealed a right atrial pressure of 7 , pulmonary artery pressure of 29/16 , rv 33/8 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 . he had a 95% proximal left anterior descending lesion which was ptca 'd to a residual of 30% and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed . he also had some mild to moderate disease at the om1 noted at that time . the patient was transferred to the cardiac care unit where he had a peak cpk of 5,042 and 26.7% mb's . his intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned without problems . he had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started . on day six , an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 44% with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis . on day nine , he had a low level exercise tolerance test with thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in ii , iii , and avf , and 1.5 mm downsloping st depressions in v5 and v6 , as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on thallium . therefore , he went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal pda lesion and a circumflex lesion after the om . the patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with dr. shuffburle of gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with dr. amesin of cardiology and dr. shuffpasc of dingclearf alllirefaith memorial hospital . however , he did not keep any of these appointments . he went home and did not take any of his medications and smoked and drank heavily throughout the several months . on the a.m. of 10-24-93 , the patient developed crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath . he came to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital emergency ward where he was noted to be ashen and diaphoretic . he was treated with oxygen , aspirin , five sublingual nitroglycerins , heparin , and was eventually made pain free with that regimen . cardiac risk factors : his cardiac risk factors included hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , cigarette smoking , and a positive family history . past medical history : his past medical history included hypertension and non-insulin diabetes mellitus which is diet controlled . past surgical history : his past surgical history had included gastric ulcer surgery and appendectomy . medications on admission : on admission , he was on isordil 10 tid and enteric coated aspirin , but he was not taking either of these medications . habits : the patient smokes one pack per day and has a history of heavy alcohol use . physical examination : the physical examination on admission revealed a blood pressure of 110/70 , a heart rate of 66 , respirations of 24 , temperature of 98 . the heent exam revealed the extra ocular movements intact . the pupils equal , round , reactive to light . the oropharynx was clear and the fundi were normal . there were no hypertensive or diabetic changes . the neck was suppled , with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention . the carotids were 1+ without bruits . the heart was regular rate and rhythm , s4 , s1 , s2 , with a i / vi systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border . the lungs were clear , except for a few dry crackles bibasilarly . the abdomen revealed a midline scar and a right lower quadrant scar , and it was soft and nontender wit positive bowel sounds . the liver edge was 2 cm below the right costal margin , but smooth and nontender . there was no splenomegaly . the femoral pulses were diminished . he had bilateral intertrigo in his femoral region as well as his axillae . the extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema . the pulses were 1+ bilaterally . the skin exam revealed changes consistent with vitiligo . the rectal examination was guaiac negative . laboratory data : the laboratory data revealed normal electrolytes , bun and creatinine , normal liver function tests , a first cpk of 140 , and a hematocrit of 43.1 . the portable chest x-ray showed clear lungs , slight enlarged heart , and a mildly elevated hemidiaphragm . the electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 81 , with normal intervals and normal axis , had poor r-wave progression consistent with an old anterior myocardial infarction , had flipped t-waves in v1 through v5 , which were of no significant change since his last ekg on 5-25-93 . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the step down unit for a rule out mi protocol . he was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin . no beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110/70 . the patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak cpk of 219 and 20.9% mb fraction . this was a non-q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes . on 10-27-93 , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been ptca 'd , a lesion in the first om , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the om3 . the left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle . given the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the ptca , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient . he was ambulated progressively on the floor . a beta blocker was started with metoprolol initially at 25 mg po bid and eventually increased to 50 mg po bid . the patient ambulated extensively on the fih 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath . on 11-2-93 , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with thallium imaging . this treadmill test was done on medications , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment . the patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified bruce protocol , however , he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade . there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm st depression in ii , iii , and avf . the study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain . thallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle . there was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test . these images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous thallium images in may 1993 . after extensive discussion between myself , dr. amesin , and dr. scgach , it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management . the patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although he understands that this may become necessary in the future . dr. amesin had a long discussion with the patient 's daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient 's compliance . previously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments . the importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient . she will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with dr. amesin as well as dr. lfsquarc on the outside . the patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization . despite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done . he will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future . caghala uinteele , m.d. tr : yf / bmot dd : 11-3-93 td : 11/04/93 cc : dr. telshey swatlleebtik dr. eri lfsquarc "}

from oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital on 03/06/99 and was then transferred to linghs county medical center from which he was discharged on 03/20/99 . the patient was doing relatively at home until one day prior to admission he complained discomfort over a suprapubic catheter area . the patient had missed his usual monthly change of his suprapubic catheter and felt discomfort and noticed some blood at the site of the catheter . the patient was brought to the emergency room one day prior to admission where he was evaluated by urology and had his catheter changed . the patient at that time noted slight shortness of breath but was sent home anyway . on the day of admission the patient noticed increasing shortness of breath . the patient was noted to be confused and to be disoriented toward the end of the day after complaining of shortness of breath for most of the day . the patient denies any recent upper respiratory infections , no fevers , no chills , no change in cough , sputum . he also denies any chest pain . no orthopnea . no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea . the patient had been taking his usual medications and using his nasal oxygen at home . by the time the patient arrived at the oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital emergency room he was in moderate respiratory distress . his initial blood gases on 40% 02 was p02 102 , pc02 115 , ph 7.11 . the patient was given respiratory therapy in the way of nebulizer treatments in the oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital emergency room because of a longstanding desire by patient and family to refrain from intubation to be considered do not resuscitate . the patient was not intubated . however he was transferred to the medical intensive care unit where he received continuous respiratory therapy in theway of albuterol nebulizers as well as nasal oxygen , intravenous steroids and intravenous antibiotics . a chest x-ray in the oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital emergency room showed new changes on his chest x-ray on top of his usual severe bilateral emphysema_____ with scarring in both lungs . there were new air space opacifications in the left apex and the right lower lobe . these were thought to be consistent either with pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema . past medical history : associated medical problems include : 1. atonic bladder with a suprapubic tube . 2. anxiety . 3. coronary artery disease with a history of angina in the distant past . 4. history of colon cancer with a colectomy in the past . medications on admission : 1. ativan 1 mg po twice a day . 2. trusopt 1 gtt left eye three times a day . 3.

electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 123 beats per minute compared to previous electrocardiogram of 1/29 there were no significant changes . hospital course : the patient was stabilized in the medical intensive care unit . he stayed in the unit for about one day . during that period of time he received nebulizer treatments with albuterol . he was also started on intravenous ticarcillin for possible gram negative pneumonia . he was diuresed with intravenous lasix to which he responded with at lease a 2l urine output on the first day and 1.5l the second day . after one day in the medical intensive care unit the patient was stable enough to go to the floor where he continued the rest of his treatment . this consisted of continued nebulizer treatments as well as intravenous antibiotics and intravenous solu-medrol . as the patient 's diuresis continued his respiratory status improved . a chest x-ray showed clearing of the opacities in the chest x-ray that were consistent with pulmonary edema because he continued to have some abnormality in the right lower lobe . the patient was continued on antibiotics for possible pneumonia . the antibiotic chosen was levaquin 500 mg 1 tab per day . this was started on 4/2/99 and should be continued for ten days . the ticarcillin was stopped after two days when it was felt that he did not have a serious pneumonia . the patient 's respiratory status continued to improve but towards the last 2-3 days of his hospitalization the amount of improvement was minimal . it was felt that his respiratory status has been maximally treated by then . the patient 's major improvement came after the first two days with brisk diuresis with lasix . while in the oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital the patient on 4/4/99 complained of mild epigastric discomfort because he was put in cimetidine while in the intensive care unit for prophylaxis against peptic ulcer disease . the patient was upgraded to prilosec 20 mg per day for possible treatment of gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease . the patient did have any nausea , vomiting or evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding . the patient 's abdominal pain should be followed over the next week or so in case it does not respond to prilosec . while in oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital the patient was never able to get out of bed and walk independently . it is

{"id": 79, "label": 4, "text": "history of present illness : this is a 64 year old patient initially admitted to dr. riode area status post an aorto bifemoral bypass in 01/98 with an end to end proximal and to the common femoral bilaterally . the patient has had recurrent claudication for the last five months and has developed lesions on the first toe which is apparently similar to aparonychia . he had an angiogram which shows a severe stenosis in the right distal area with a thrombosing right limb of an aorto femoral graft . he also has an irregular lesion at the profunda femoris origin and with the superficial femoral occluded bilaterally . he was therefore admitted to the hospital for an ileofemoral bypass . the patient unfortunately continues to smoke and has greater than a 50 pack year history of smoking and by notes of dr. area 's office , this has been discussed at length with him and the implications of the smoking . he has a history of a deep vein thrombosis and a question of a pulmonary embolism with what is thought to be a non fully documented hypercoagulable state . he had a left superficial femoral artery interposition graft around 1990 which is non functioning at the present time , most of which was done at the alconspore woocawo medical center . allergies : the patient has no known drug allergies . medications on admission : his medications on admission include coumadin and levofloxacin . his coumadin has been held for two days . his claudication is equal bilaterally . physical examination : on physical examination was remarkable for no carotid bruits , a ventral hernia without any masses which was reasonably reducible . his rectal exam was refused at the time of surgery since apparently it was negative at the tocon hospital the previous week . he has a first and fourth toe which had some purulent discharge around the toes with ischemic modeled toes and on the left side there were no lesions in the feet . his pulse exam was a femoral pulse bilaterally , but none distally . laboratory data : his bun and creatinine were within normal limits at 16 and 1.3 and his hematocrit was 44 with a white blood count of 10,000 and 139,000 platelet count . he has ankle brachial indices of .36 bilaterally but with his right toes appearing ischemic with lesions he would most likely not heal these lesions . hospital course : dr. area had asked me to see the patient and after discussing with the patient it was agreed that i would proceed with revascularization of his right leg since he had a angiogram which demonstrated a failing limb of his aortofemoral graft and a tight profundus stenosis . after discussing with the patient , getting his prothrombin time closer to range , he was brought to the operating room where a ileo profunda bypass was performed with an 8 mm . ep to fe under general endotracheal anesthesia . there was copious thrombus in the distal right limb of the aortofemoral graft which also had a thromboendarterectomy performed and excellent inflow was achieved . superficial femoral artery was divided since it was also chronically occluded . there was a significant amount of thrombus at the anastomosis as well which had developed a small aneurysmaltype of dilatation , although there was no dehiscence of the anastomosis . the profunda had been opened beyond the origin stenosis and the bypass was then performed providing and excellent flow to the calf and excellent pulsevolume recordings were obtained with strong upstrokes . it was therefore elected not to proceed with a distal bypass graft to the popliteal arteries which would have been required should this not have worked . the patient postoperatively did quite well . he had continued good post volume recordings and there was no question that with this improved circulation and silvadene dressings to his toes that they actually started to heal in his postoperative course with improved perfusion and capillary refill . his groin incision was healing nicely and he was on heparin , being converted to coumadin . because of the issue relating to his hypercoagulable state , and the need for getting him in range , he was keptin the hospital and not discharged . the orders of his wounds and wound care were clarified and he was transferred to frontera 34 to ensure that this would be performed properly . no cellulitis was present , and the patient had indicated his desire to be discharged . despite loading him on coumadin , his prothrombin time and inr increased slowly and he left the hospital
