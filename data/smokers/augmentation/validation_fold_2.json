in rapid atrial fibrillation . he denied any angina . he had a gaited cardiac blood pool scan that showed an ejection fraction of 31% . his pulmonary function tests showed fev1 of 2.1 , and he was found to have intermittent obstructive sleep apnea . an echocardiogram showed a dilated left atrium with mitral anular calcification . he was discharged home but readmitted on may 21 with recurrent congestive heart failure . a thallium stress test showed equivocal st segment changes with fixed apical and inferior defects . his coronary risk factors include cigarette smoking , obesity , a family history of coronary disease , and elevated serum cholesterol . he also has a history of atrial fibrillation with sinus pauses during sleep apnea . on june 4 , 1993 , he underwent cardiac catheterization . he was found to have an occluded right coronary artery , 70% distal left main lesion , 80% proximal ramus lesion , and his left ventricular ejection shows preserved function except for akinesis of the inferior wall . his ejection fraction was 50% , a carotid duplex study showed plaqueing but no critical lesions . past medical history : as above . social history : he has a wife pandeprob and lives in ashing . he did smoke up to three pack per day . he has three children . he is retired . physical examination : six foot , 250 pounds . he is a well appearing male , in no

his electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation . there were nonspecific st and t wave changes . hospital course : the patient was admitted to hellworthston hospital . there , he stabilized , and was seen in consultation by cardiology and anesthesiology . there was concern over his sleep apnea , but he appeared to have primarily cardiac disease and therefore because of the left main stenosis , it was reasonable to proceed . on june 24 , 1993 , dr. lenni breutzoln performed triple coronary bypass surgery . he placed a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , single saphenous vein to the posterior descending artery with 170 cc. per minute flow and a single saphenous vein to the circumflex with 140 cc. per minute flow . he weaned easily off cardiopulmonary bypass . he had no hemodynamic difficulties . he was able to wean from the ventilator , but he did have marginal oxygenation throughout . he did revert back to atrial fibrillation . he was extubated within forty eight hours . he was transferred out of the surgical intensive care unit on june 26 . he reverted back to atrial fibrillation that required digoxin , and verapamil to control . he could not be converted back to normal sinus rhythm even with a trial of quinaglute . he also had anemia and he was seen in consultation by the nutrition service . he was advised to have an ideal body weight of 178 pounds , and clearly a 2300 calorie diet was appropriate for him . weight reduction would be important in the long term management of his coronary disease . he was treated with digoxin and diuretics along with ace inhibitors because of his depressed left ventricular function . he was able to ambulate although somewhat slowly because of his rapid atrial fibrillation . it was considered to obtain a pulmonary consultation on a formal basis , but it was then felt that he would do better by healing fully from his surgery , because he really had little in the way of pulmonary complications , despite the history of sleep apnea of an obstructive basis . primary in his long term management is cardiac rehabilitation with weight reduction . he will be followed closely in 23 hwy , hamp by dr. laymie

coronary artery bypass graft surgery by dr. elks at feargunwake otacaa community hospital and did well until 1988 when she had exertional angina and a positive stress test and found that three or four grafts were occluded . in october , 1989 , dr. no re-did her bypass operation . she had a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 2 . in 1993 she had a ddd pacemaker for complete heart block . she had exertional angina at that time . in november , 1997 she had a small myocardial infarction as was transferred to ona hospital where a cardiac catheterization showed a tight left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending stenosis , high grade saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 stenosis and patent obtuse marginal 2 graft . she had normal left ventricular function with apical tip akinesis . since that time she has continued to have exertional left chest burning , radiating to the left neck and arm , relieved by nitroglycerin . she was turned down for re-do surgery at that time and did not have a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty . because these symptoms have been increasing , particularly at cardiac rehabilitation , she was referred here . in may , 1998 she had an exercise tolerance test in which her heart rate went to 112 and her blood pressure fell to 95 systolic . she had diffuse ischemic st segment changes and increased lung uptake and a reversible anterior and lateral defect . she has had no syncope . her cardiac risk factors are hypertension and elevated cholesterol . she has a very strong family history of coronary artery disease with a mother , sister and brother dying of myocardial infarction . she is a remote

105 , carbon dioxide 30 , bun 24 , creatinine 1.0 . hospital course and treatment : the patient was admitted to the cardiac catheterization laboratory . there , her pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure 44/17 . her left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with dyskinesis of the apex . she had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction . her native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was an obtuse marginal branch . the saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded . the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded . the saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with no significant stenosis , but there was an outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery . this was considered her culprit lesion . this was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft . in addition , it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs . her left internal mammary artery was also unused . it was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead . she would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing . this was intermittent . the p wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed . the patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker . it was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure . her pacemaker was set to a vvi mode which sensed appropriately . she was in sinus rhythm with most of the time . when her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker , she had significant angina . carotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable . the situation was reviewed with dr. niste graft . he felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction . for this reason , it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates . the situation was reviewed with dr. no of the pacemaker service . on august 20 , under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a cpi unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .15 mm. , which permitted appropriate atrial sensing . there was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads . it just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode . she tolerated this well . her medications were resumed . she ambulated without difficulty and was discharged to home to be followed medically for her coronary artery disease following two

echocardiogram 3/27/93 . doctors discharge orders : lasix 40 mg qd ; digoxin 0.25 mg qd ; aspirin 325 mg qd ; isordil 10 mg tid . history of present illness : mr. breun underwent a six vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure in march , 1990 , following a complicated inferior posterior myocardial infarction . he had a very stormy course , dominated by post infarction angina pectoris , high grade atrial ventricular block , gastrointestinal bleeding , pneumonia , and no noliguric renal failure . an intra-aortic balloon pump was required for stabilization . he also had moderately severe aortic stenosis at that time with a peak aortic valve gradient of 30 , and a calculated valve area of 1.2 cm squared . despite the magnitude of these problems , he made a remarkable recovery over the course of several months , and was able to return to work on a part-time basis , after joining a program of cardiac rehabilitation . postoperatively , we measured a left ventricle ejection fraction of 40% , by gated cardiac blood pool scanning . over these past 3 years , he has remained stable , on a very simple program of aspirin , and atenolol . he returned for routine office evaluation on 3/25/93 , complaining of 2 months of progressive exertional dyspnea , with occasional chest discomfort , and , more recently , orthopnea , cough , peripheral edema , and weight gain . physical examination : weight 197 lbs , up 6 lbs , blood pressure 128/88 , heart rate 70 and regular . the venous pressure was markedly elevated to 15 cm . the carotids were of low volume , and sluggish bilaterally , with transmission of a basal heart murmur . there was dullness at both bases , with rales 1/3 way upon the right , and at the base on the left . the right ventricle , and left ventricle impulses were diffuse . there was a grade i-ii murmur of aortic stenosis , with additional murmurs of tricuspid , and mitral regurgitation , and an obvious s3 . the liver was enlarged 2 finger breadths below the right costal margin , and there was 1-2+ peripheral edema . his chest x-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly , with bilateral pleural effusions , right greater than left , and pulmonary vascular re-distribution . the electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with first degree av block , an old inferior myocardial infarction , and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction , and non-specific st-t wave abnormalities , that were unchanged compared to june , 1992 . later , an echocardiogram on 3/27/93 , demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with calcification of the annulus , and incomplete closure of the valve , consistent with papillary muscle dysfunction . the left atrium was dilated to 52 mm . the aortic valve was thickened , with restrictive motion , and there were indistinct mobile echo densities on the leaflets . there was evidence of trace aortic regurgitation , however , due to technical difficulties , accurate gradients could not be estimated . the left ventricle was dilated , with concentric hypertrophy , and multi segmental wall motion abnormalities , with a reduced ejection fraction of 24% . there was also doppler evidence of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary insufficiency . a persantine thallium scan on 3/31/93 , showed increased lung uptake , cavity dilatation and a large inferior , apical scar , without evidence of active ischemia . laboratory data : potassium 4.4 , bun and creatinine 33/1.7 , albumen 3.6 , total bilirubin 1.8 , direct bilirubin 0.5 , ck 162 , with 11.1 mb for a relative index of 6.9% . this was of uncertain significance . the hematocrit 43.2 , whiteblood count 9.2 , prothrombin time 10.4 , partial thromboplastin time 34.2 , urinalysis had 1+ albumen and 0-2 white blood cells , per high power field , with a culture that demonstrated rare enterococcus . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the medical service , and placed at bed rest , and given intravenous furosemide . over the course of the next few days , we succeeded in having his weight decrease from its value of 189 lbs , to as low as 177 1/2 lbs . coincident with this , his clinical condition improved markedly , and he became fully ambulatory . given the difficulties in trying to assess the exact mechanism by which his heart failure had occurred , we proceeded to cardiac catheterization on 4/1/93 . at the time of this study , the right atrial pressure was 1 , the pa pressure 32/10 , and the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 10 . there was a 40-50 mm peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve , a mean gradient of 40 , and a calculated valve area of 0.5 cm squared , using a cardiac output of 3.4 liters per minute . left ventriculography demonstrated marked left ventricle dilatation . there was mild mitral regurgitation , a posterior basil aneurysm , and akinesis of the apex , septum , and inferior walls . the anterior lateral wall was severely hypokinetic , and the posterior lateral wall moderately kinetic . the aortic valve was calcified with reduced excursion consistent with his aortic stenosis . a dominant right coronary artery had an 80% proximal stenosis , and was then occluded at the acute margin . a large right ventricular marginal branch did fill the saphenous vein graft in a retrograde fashion . the posterior descending artery had an 80% stenosis proximal to the insertion of the graft . the left anterior descending was proximally occluded , and the left circumflex had a 90% stenosis in the first marginal branch , and 90% stenosis distally in other branches . the saphenous vein graft to the right ventricular acute marginal and posterior descending artery was patent with good runoff . the saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending had a minor plaque at the distal anastomosis . the saphenous vein graft to three distal marginal branches was patent with good flow . certainly , the cardiac catheterization was consistent with severe aortic stenosis in the presence of profound left ventricular systolic dysfunction . these findings were reviewed with dr. patella and together we decided that conservative therapy would be the appropriate first choice in mr. breun 's management . his advanced age , prior cardiac surgery and advanced left ventricular dysfunction , together with his chronic renal insufficiency , would certainly complicate to an enormous degree any undertaking as risky as redo surgery for aortic valve replacement . percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty , on the other hand , would only be a temporary procedure and did not seem necessary even for transient symptomatic relief given his marked improvement following a rather conventional course of intravenous diuretics . it is very unlikely that we will offer mr. breun aortic valve replacement surgery in the future . he seems to agree with this particular approach as the quality of life has become very important and appropriate issue for him . he is looking forward to returning home and going back to work on a part time basis at the local pharmacy . we will see how far we can get with medical therapy although mr. wierst and his family clearly understand the long term implications of his aortic stenosis . ethelan kotefyfechird , m.d. tr : go / bmot dd : 4/4/93 td : 04/06/93 cc : "}

twenty years who presented to the gemenadentoolpai medical center with a revolving anterolateral wall myocardial infarction on 08-01-93 . she has been under the care of dr. aalv manual and was referred here for further therapy . she had no prior significant cardiac history and presented to her local medical doctor 's office with an episode of severe retrosternal chest pain . her electrocardiogram showed a new right bundle branch block and left anterior hemiblock . the patient was transferred to the gemenadentoolpai medical center and was admitted . her hospital course was remarkable for ruling in for a myocardial infarction with a peak cpk of 9,379 units with a 5.9% mb fraction . in addition , on telemetry she developed complete heart block and hypotension requiring temporary pacing wire and then a permanent pacemaker implantation on 08-03-93 . she developed congestive heart failure and required pressor support . she underwent cardiac catheterization on 8-15-93 and was found to have a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 28 millimeters of mercury . she had a dominant right coronary artery with minor disease . the main left coronary artery had a 20% stenosis . the left anterior descending had a severe 80% proximal stenosis with a filling defect consistent with intraluminal thrombus . the circumflex artery had a minor 40% stenosis . cine left ventriculogram revealed a dilated left ventricle with an area of anterolateral , apical , and septal akinesis . the left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to 38% . the patient was transferred to the heaonboburg linpack grant medical center for consideration of coronary angioplasty . cardiac risk factors : her risk factors for coronary artery disease included a positive family history and an elevated cholesterol level . past medical history : her past medical history is remarkable for a history of parkinson 's disease . physical examination : her physical examination at the time of admission revealed a pleasant lady in no acute distress . the blood pressure was 120/70 millimeters of mercury . her pulse was regular at 80 beats per minute . the jugular venous pressure was elevated at 6 cm above the sternal angle . the carotids were normal . the chest was clear . the cardiac examination revealed anapical impulse in the fifth left intercostal space , left to mid clavicular line . the first sound was normal . the second sound was normally split . she had no murmurs and no gallops . the examination the abdomen was benign . the examination of the extremities showed no edema . she had good pulses bilaterally . laboratory data : her electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm , left atrial enlargement , left axis deviation , poor r-wave progression in v1 through v4 , consistent with marked clockwise rotation , cannot rule out an old anteroseptal wall myocardial infarction . there were prominent q-waves in avl , consistent with lateral myocardial infarction . there were non-specific st-t wave abnormalities . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the medical service . the patient was seen in consultation by the neurology department because of the history of parkinson 's disease . the patient was maintained on intravenous heparin . on 8-17-93 , she was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where she underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the proximal left anterior descending . following balloon angioplasty , there was a local dissection with evidence of intraluminal thrombus , with a greater than 10% loss in the initial gain following coronary angioplasty . therefore , directional coronary atherectomy was performed with an excellent angiographic outcome , and a less than 10% residual narrowing . the patient tolerated the procedure well . she was maintained on intravenous heparin and was brought back to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on 08-18-93 for a relook coronary angiography . coronary angiography demonstrated ongoing benefit of the initial coronary atherectomy . specifically , there was no decrease in the initial gain that she achieved after directional atherectomy . the patient remained stable during the rest of the hospitalization . she was transferred in stable condition to the pasi for further rehabilitation therapy . renlan fyfezeis

kotereef is a 93-year-old woman who was transferred from daleglo medical center with renal insufficiency . the patient was in her usual state of health until 7/10/98 when she was admitted to the daleglo medical center with a chief complaint of falling and mental status changes . she was initially treated for heart failure and pneumonia and , on the night of admission , she experienced a fever to 104 , acute respiratory distress and required intubation for two days . the patient was noted to have a cpk of 150 with 11.8 percent mb but no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes . she was treated for congestive heart failure and was diuresed and extubated . she was transferred to the floor where initially she did very well but subsequently developed an elevated bun and creatinine and failure to eat . the patient 's granddaughter requested that she be transferred to the ph university of medical center where she had been cared for in the past for her myocardial infarction as well as cerebrovascular disease . past medical history : her past medical history is notable for congestive heart failure with a last ejection fraction noted to be 28 percent in april of 1997 . she also has a history of urinary tract infection . she has a history of diverticulosis with lower gi bleeds . in 01/95 she was admitted with a cerebral vascular accident notable for right facial droop and left-sided weakness . there was marked improvement in these symptoms thereafter , and the patient was discharged on coumadin which was subsequently discontinued . the patient also has a history of myocardial infarction in 1977 and 1987 and underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting x4 in 1987 . she also has a history of polymyalgia rheumatica with a bilateral temporal artery being biopsied and being negative for temporal arteritis . she also has a history of right proximal femur fracture and internal fixation in 1995 . on arrival to the ph university of medical center the patient stated that she had not had a bowel movement for many days and that she had no appetite . however , she denied any chest pain , dyspnea or syncope . physical examination : on physical examination her pulse was 55 . her systolic blood pressure was 110 . she appeared to be very dry with very dry mucosa . her lungs had few rhonchi , no rales . her cardiac exam was irregular but her heart sounds were distant . her abdomen showed active bowel sounds , was nontender and she had no pedal edema . laboratory data : laboratory data was notable for hematocrit of 33.5 , white count of 14.7 , platelet count of 270 . bun 112 , creatinine 2.3 , sodium 142 , potassium 4.2 , co2 23.4 , and chloride 104 . a chest x-ray revealed clear lungs on a portable chest x-ray without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema . a kub showed a large loop of dilated bowel but no free air and a tortuous calcified aorta . an electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of an old inferior myocardial infarction and right bundle branch block . hospital course and treatment : the patient was admitted to goman 25 where she was hydrated for the presumed diagnosis of pre-renal azotemia . a urinalysis was notable for pyuria with 50 to 100 white cells , and the patient was begun on levofloxacin for presumed polymicrobial urinary tract infection . a head ct scan was performed which showed multiple old ischemic infarcts in the right frontal and cerebellar lobes . there was diffuse atrophy and no evidence of recent bleed . the patient was evaluated by the rheumatology service who noted that the patient 's diagnosis was most consistent with rheumatoid arthritis and possibly pmr . the patient had been followed by dr. friednantflirt of the ph university of medical center . at that time she was noted to have undergone bilateral temporal artery biopsies , both of which were negative for temporal arteritis . the recommendation from the rheumatology service was to attempt to decrease her prednisone to 5 mg po q.day with an eye on a change in the severity of her shoulder arthritis symptoms . on the third hospital day the patient developed a sudden change in her mental status while taking pills . she was noted to be arousable and responsive and minimally conversation . however , she was unable to move her right arm or leg . her eyes were deviated to the left and she had a right facial droop . the patient was taken to the emergent cat scan which revealed no acute bleeding and was felt to be a cerebral vascular occlusion . the patient was evaluated by the stroke service , which recommended a lumbar puncture which was performed and did not reveal evidence of meningitis . a cardiac ultrasound was performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 50 percent with wall motion abnormalities in the inferior septal and inferior walls involving the apex . there was trace mitral regurgitation . multiple aortic valve leaflets were thickened without stenosis . there was no evidence of an intraventricular thrombus . the patient was initially treated by increasing her aspirin from 81 mg to 325 mg . she was also continued to be hydrated . her blood pressure medications were held to allow increased cerebral perfusion . after careful discussion with the neurology service , it was felt that the patient was at too great a risk to be started and maintained on anticoagulant therapy and therefore she was treated conservatively . the patient was subsequently evaluated by the speech pathology service , the physical therapy service and the occupational therapy service for evaluation for her recovery from her stroke . her bun and creatinine continued to decrease with hydration and zestril was re-initiated and , as her blood pressure allowed , her isordil was re-initiated and then her zestril was increased to 10 mg po q.day . digoxin was discontinued because of her improved left ventricular ejection fraction . the patient did have a steady decrease in her hematocrit to a minimum of 26.2 and received one unit of packed red blood cells with restoration of her hematocrit over 30 . her ferritin was 83 and there was no evidence of guaiac positive stools . it was elected to defer further evaluation of her anemia at this time . however , if she became more evidently guaiac positive it would be appropriate to evaluate the source of bleeding in her colon and potentially in her esophagus and stomach . nevertheless , the patient was switched from aspirin to plavix 75 mg po q.day in view of her history of lower gi bleeding . major consideration toward the end of the patient 's hospitalization was whether or not she would be able to take adequate po intake to maintain her volume status . initially it was felt that the patient would require gastroscopy . however , with the assistance of the patient 's granddaughter , the patient was able to increase her po intake with a lot of assistance . the patient 's granddaughter felt that it was likely that her po intake would improve when she returned home to the nursing home . i discussed this with the granddaughter and told her that if her po intake was inadequate , that gastrostomy tube would be reasonable in the future and that we would be available to assist in this as it became necessary . the patient was evaluated by the gi service who thought that a peg would be quite feasible and that they would be delighted to do this if it was necessary and the patient and family agreed . nevertheless , we have decided to postpone this issue for now and to see how she does when she returns to the nursing home . the patient will be transferred tomorrow to naplesvillechaelty . i will get in touch with dr. areas and please do not hesitate to contact me if i can provide any

1) gi - the patient was admitted to the floor and underwent extraction of the piece of chicken from his esophagus later that afternoon . extraction was successful and foreign body was removed piecemeal . egd was performed . subsequently at the site where the chicken was stuck there was no notable trauma or lesion distal to the chicken . there was some gastritis and duodenitis but no frank ulcers . the patient was sent to the floor and gi wise was doing well until approximately 9/22/93 when he developed an ileus one day status post teeth extraction and general anesthesia . the patient also had a gi bleed at that time and an ng tube was placed with removal of 2500 cc of dark brown bilious guaiac positive fluid . the patient was stabilized with fluid and improved quickly from this status over the weekend and hct has been stable since that time . other gi issues include the patient 's hypopharyngeal cancer which will be discussed below . 2) oncology - the patient was diagnosed prior to this admission with hypopharyngeal cancer for which he was going to undergo external radiation therapy for . because of the multiple complications and lack of nutrition and inability of the patient to swallow without aspirating it was felt that this should be delayed until he is under better nutritional status . 3) feeding and nutrition - the patient was unable to eat any food or drink by mouth given that he demonstrated frank aspiration each time he attempted this including with soft solids and puree foods . a swallowing study was performed which clearly demonstrated frank aspiration and poor swallowing mechanism by the patient . several ng tubes were placed and the patient kept pulling the ng tubes out because his mental status was not completely cleared . the patient was sustained on iv fluids with d10 and multivitamins , thiamine , and folate . he was kept npo given his history of aspiration and further attempts were made to fee the patient and finally as the patient 's mental status cleared he was responsive to having an ng feeding tube placed with jevity feeds started . other options were considered including a peg placement as well as surgical placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it was felt that less aggressive measures with an ng tube would be prudent at this juncture given the patient 's poor prognosis for the future . the family was involved in making decisions regarding the patient 's nutritional status and originally felt that iv fluids alone should be used , however , finally decided that some sort of feeding should be undertaken and the ng tube was the initial thought . it is felt that if the ng tube does not work out the patient may need to be reassessed for potential placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it is felt by all parties involved that the aggressive end may also present significant risk to this patient given that an operative procedure may be dangerous and patient has shown significant desaturation and uncooperativeness with his first egd on admission . 4) pulmonary - the patient had a clear chest x-ray other than a right lower lobe opacity consistent with scarring vs. fat pad which has been chronic on admission . the patient was saturating well throughout the initial part of the stay until he had the upper gi bleed on 9/22/93 at which time he also had significant aspiration of vomitus and was considered to have a probable aspiration pneumonia but with vague findings on chest x-ray . the chest x-ray cleared rather rapidly and on the third day post aspiration was consistent with the original admission x-ray . however , after aspiration given that the patient had a white count bump from under 10,000 to 16,000 it was felt that he should be started on antibiotics and he was started on ceftriaxone and clindamycin for a total 10 day course for presumptive aspiration pneumonia . the patient was afebrile throughout this period and tolerated antibiotics well and pneumonia appeared to resolve . no organism was ever cultured out of the sputum . 5) gu - the patient was not entirely responsive to using urinal or the bathroom and at times was incontinent . it was thought that a foley catheter would be most appropriate and he seemed to tolerate this well . he had at one point the possibility of uti but he was asymptomatic and on rechecking the urine there was no sign of urinary tract infection . the patient continued to be asymptomatic . 6) neurological - the patient originally was almost completely non-responsive at least to verbal command but as his hospital course progressed he became somewhat more alert and towards the end of his hospital course was much more alert and oriented usually only times two and was difficult . the patient was much more cooperative towards the end of his stay and much more appropriate , however , he did not seem to fully comprehend the fact that he had cancer and that he would not be able to swallow things by mouth . these issues were explained to him repeatedly , however , he did not appear to comprehend them from day to day . psychiatry evaluated the patient and felt that he was not competent to decide his own affairs . 7) social issues - the wife had obtained health proxy prior to this admission and it was felt that since the patient was not competent to make decisions on his own the wife would make decisions regarding the health status and treatment of the patient . it was decided the patient 's code status would not be dnr , dni . 8) dental - the patient was noted to have very few teeth and it was noted that none appeared viable and it was felt that since he would be undergoing xrt in the future that his teeth should be removed to avoid radiation necrosis in the future when he received his xrt . he underwent extraction of all his teeth on 9/21/93 tolerating the procedure well initially but then developed the ileus as noted above and subsequently a gi bleed . laboratory data on discharge revealed sma 7 with sodium 134 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 , co2 24 , bun 5 , and creatinine 0.9 which has been stable at 0.9 to 1.0 with glucose 96 . cbc revealed hct 30.7 which has been ranging from high of 29 to 31 over the last week . the white count was 7.5 , platelets 196 . the last pt and ptt on 09/26/93 were 13.4 and 27.3 with inr of 1.2 . the last ua and sedimentation revealed rare white blood cells but was otherwise negative and the culture revealed no growth on 09/27/93 . the patient had a chest x-ray which showed a few right upper lobe and one left upper lobe nodule and a follow-up chest x-ray on 09/27/93 showed resolution of these previous nodular shadows . a faint nodule remained in the left upper lobe and it was felt that this is probably not any metastatic disease and not of concern , however , it was suggested that follow-up chest x-ray may be taken to insure that these densities resolve . operative procedures : extraction of all remaining teeth under general anesthesia on 9/21/93 . complications : 1) aspiration pneumonia . 2) gi bleed . 3) ileus secondary to general anesthesia for above operation . disposition : condition on discharge : the patient is stable on discharge . the patient is to be transferred to paw.ryfear medical center for further care including physical therapy , occupational therapy , and further nutritional support . discharge medications : pepcid 20 mg po iv b.i.d. for history of gastritis and gi bleed , heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d.

however , no ischemia was seen . an echocardiogram was done . the echocardiogram showed terrible left ventricular function , with left ventricular aneurysm . the right ventricle appeared to be acceptable . the percutaneous drainage catheter continued to have high output . the fluid was sent for amylase , which came back 53,230 . on 4/28/95 , the patient had new onset of abdominal pain . his white count had bumped from 8.3 on admission to 18.5 , on 4/27 . a computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed . approximately 100 cc.'s of thick brownish material was aspirated through the indwelling catheter . the computerized tomography scan showed the catheter tip in good position . because of the patient 's deteriorating state , the patient was brought to the operating room on 4/28/95 . an exploratory laparotomy was performed . the splenic flexure had a purulent exudative process along the antimesenteric surface . thus , the splenic flexure and a portion of the descending colon were resected . the patient underwent a left colectomy with end transverse colostomy , and oversewing of the descending colon . drainage of the pancreatic necrosis was also done . the patient tolerated the procedure fairly well , and was transferred to the intensive care unit . in the intensive care unit , the patient had a prolonged course . the patient was then extubated on postoperative day #2 , but remained pressor-dependent . he remained on imipenem , and vancomycin was also started . thereafter , the patient had a long and complicated postoperative course . he was eventually transferred to the floor , where he remained meta-stable . he had repeated episodes of hypotension to 80-90 systolic/40-50 diastolic . these resolved without incident . he also had repeated temperature spikes . after repeated work ups , it was felt that these were probably due to remaining infection in the peripancreatic area . his drainage tube from the peripancreatic area was gradually advanced , and eventually discontinued . mr. mass was placed on multiple courses of antibiotics . most recently , he was on a 28 day course of vancomycin , ofloxacin , and flagyl , for blood cultures that were positive for gram positive cocci and enteric and non-enteric gram negative rods . this 28 day course was completed on 07/15/95 . the patient was also treated initially with amphotericin-b and then with fluconazole for a computerized tomography guided aspirate of a small fluid collection around his pancreas , which grew candida albicans . the patient also had several episodes of fungal cystitis with torulopsis glabrata , going from his urine . he was treated with amphotericin-b bladder washes for this . mr. mass was initially anticoagulated for his left ventricular aneurysm . he remained stable from a cardiac fashion . he did have problems with po intake . he had repeated bouts of small-volume emesis that may have been secondary to reflux . he was treated with a variety of anti-emetics , most recently granisetron , with only mild success . he remained total parenteral nutrition-dependent throughout his hospital course . by the end of june , it became clear that mr. mass would require aggressive surgical intervention in order to eradicate his intra-abdominal bursts of intermittent sepsis ; however , long discussions with the patient and his wife , who was his health-care proxy , revealed that they felt that no further aggressive intervention be attempted . the patient had been made a do not resuscitate do not intubate patient earlier in his hospital stay . multiple discussions were held between dr. mass , the rest of the surgical team , and the patient 's wife , with this same result . after discussion with the patient 's primary doctor , dr. douet at vassdiysey medical center , it was felt that the patient and his family would be best served if the patient were transferred to vassdiysey medical center . of note , given the patient 's do not resuscitate status and the risk for bleeding , the patient 's coumadin was stopped without incident several weeks before transfer . doctors discharge instructions : medications : 1. heparin , 5,000 units , sc. , b.i.d. 2. lisinopril , 20 mg. , po , qd . 3. isordil , 10 mg. , po , t.i.d. 4. nitropaste , 1 inch to chest wall , q8h. 5. carafate , one gram , po or per nasogastric tube , q.i.d. , cardizem , 30 mg. , po , q6h , digoxin , 0.25 mg. , po or intravenously , qd , fluconazole , 200 mg. , qd , for five more days , after transfer , for a total of a 14 day course , total parenteral nutrition to meet the patient 's nutritional needs . the patient has an ostomy appliance around the former site of his pancreatic fistula drain . this area has continued to drain and it is felt that it could be best managed by an ostomy appliance and stoma care . the patient is also treated with shots of morphine for intermittent pain . i drain , m.d. dictating for : liasun l. mass , m.d. tr : aet / bmot dd : 07/16/95 td : 07/15/95 cc : stat discharge summary . copies to dr. liasun mass , dr. tomedankell new of cardiology , and dr. scosthuang of vassdiysey medical center . please have a copy in the chart ;

history of parkinson 's disease x 's 18 years , prostate cancer , urinary incontinence and recent subdurals after fall . he reports lower abdominal pain x's 2 days . of note , he is a very poor historian given his difficulty speaking and inability to write from his parkinson 's disease . his wife noted him to be restless on the day of admission , felt warm , temperature to 102.5 . they went to a local hospital where he was found to have a temperature of 102.4 and blood cultures were done and he was transferred to ph university of medical center for admission . he was recently started on a texas catheter for urinary incontinence at home . he has no symptoms of shortness of breath , cough , diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , choking on food , no new medications . past medical history : as above . medications ; on admission were eldepryl , artane , prilodol , sinemet and opuputine . allergies : he had no known drug allergies . hospital course and treatment : the patient was admitted and started on ampingent intravenously . there was a question of aspiration pneumonia so he was switched from ampicillin pen-g to aspiration pneumonia . he was continued on his parkinson 's medications . a head ct was scheduled to rule out interval increase in subdurals . head ct results show full bilateral acute hemorrhage in his subdural hematomas , now with slight midline shift . dr. factor agreed he would review the cts and follow the patient while in house . he was seen by urology , who suggested to leave the catheter in for now in the setting of doubt ms . he was seen by neuro , who felt that the subdural hemorrhages should be followed and treated conservatively as well as precautions for fall and no further intervention was warranted given risk of re-bleed which is quite high with his atrophic changes . the patient 's mental status improved greatly after the onset of intravenous antibiotics , doing much better , was much more awake and alert and the plan was to possibly send him home on po antibiotics and full arnsperni health services . bedside swallow test was done which showed him to have some aspiration . he did have some recurrent fevers and his intravenous antibiotic were continued . thus , he was considered ready for discharge . he again became much more somnolent , there was a question whether he had re-aspirated . he again was becoming increasing febrile and somnolent while the patient was awaiting a chest x-ray and further evaluation . he was switched over the clinda and gentamicin for his aspiration pneumonia and again his mental status improved . on 8/10/97 , the patient became unresponsive and apneic . brachial consult was obtained and the patient was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit . he was found to be profoundly hypoxic with sats down to 60% on 100% facemask . he was hypotensive into the 80s . an electrocardiogram showed evolving inferior q wave with increased st segment and left anterior st depressions . rv leads were negative for st elevation . a chest x-ray showed marked congestive heart failure with increased heart size . a portable echo showed no pericardial effusion and his left ventricle was severely diffusely hypokinetic with septal dyskinesis . anterior and inferior akinesis , apical akinesis to the posterior lateral wall moved slightly . he had about 20% mild mitral regurgitation . the right ventricle was markedly dilated with a kinetic free wall and very decreased function in a marked incomplete closure of the tricuspid valve with wide open tricuspid regurgitation . he was transferred to the intensive care unit for his acute myocardial infarction with very likely multi-vessel disease with concominent left anterior descending severe stenosis or likely left anterior descending with collateral circulation from that occluded right coronary artery . the patient was also evaluated by neurosurgery , given the difficult situation , the patient was not a candidate for streptokinase or tpa given his chronic subdurals with a recent new bleed . he was evaluated by neurosurgery , who felt that if heparin could be avoided , that would be best . he was treated conservatively with intubation , control of heart rate and on dobutamine for pressure support . he was diuresed with lasix and diuril and was oxygenating fairly well while intubated . he surprisingly made it through the next 24 hours . he was dynamically stable on his dobutamine with improved oxygenation . the patient continued fairly stable while intubated . two days after the myocardial infarction he continued with stable blood pressure on a very small amount of dobutamine . he had diuresed very well with good oxygenation . his neurostatus was indeterminate given his sedation on the ventilatory . discussions with the family were ongoing regarding do not resuscitate and long term plan given his comorbidities . they were waiting appropriately for some information from the repeat echo after his myocardial infarction . an echo showed that there was not much improvement in cardiac function , both right or left ventriculus . they did at that time decide to make him do not resuscitate , but were interested in continuing supportive care to see how much he would bounce back . the repeat echo showed no improvement in left ventricle or right ventricle function with marked akinesis of many walls . the lack of meaningful recovery was much less likely . discussions were had with the family regarding withdrawal of ventilator support , which they very appropriately decided on given the low possibility of any meaningful recovery . he was extubated successfully and was breathing comfortably on his own . the patient was transferred back to the medical floor in stable , but very guarded condition . no further blood draws were done . the patient was made comfortable on a low dose of intravenous morphine with sectioning to prevent further aspiration . comfort measures continued until the day 8/19/97 , where mr. koteleebdils was found to be pulseless , without respirations . he was declared dead at 7:15 a.m. on 8/19/97 . the family and the attending

diagnosed in 1997 and treated with surgery , radiation , and hormonal treatment . she had actually completed her five years of tomaxifin , but was continuing to be plagued by menopausal symptoms and finally in the summery of 2004 understanding the obvious potential risks , she began an estrogen patch . not long afterwards she began to develop some bone pains which progressed over the late summer and fall requiring escalation of opiates and restaging confirmed the presence of metastases throughout her spine and in the base of her skull , ribs , arms , etc ... but no visceral involvement . she ultimately was admitted to the hospital because of delirium and difficulty controlling the pain . she had no fevers , chills , headaches , or neck stiffness . there had been no focal neurologic changes . up until this admission she had been relatively independent and was very dismayed to discover the extensive relapse of her disease . on admission to the hospital her temperature was 99 , heart rate 99 , blood pressure 151/87 , o2 saturation on room air was 92% . she did look mildly dyspneic . her lungs were clear . she had good range of motion throughout except for severe local tenderness and swelling on the mid third of her right clavicle which impaired right shoulder movement . she was oriented to place and name and this waxed and waned over the next couple of days . the rest of her neurologic exam was essentially intact . laboratory data : sodium of 137 , bun of 25 , creatinine of 0.9 , glucose of 77 , calcium slightly high at 10.9 with an albumin of 3.7 . bilirubin normal . her alt 11 , her ast slightly up at 59 . her alk phos slightly up at 174 . wbc 10.8 with normal differential . hemoglobin 12.2 , hematocrit 36.6 , mcv 89 , platelets 345,0000 . a urinalysis showed cloudy urine with 10-20 red cells and 20-50 white cells . a ca 153 was significantly elevated at 66.5 ( normal 0-30 ) . the patient was brought to the floor , hydrated gently , given another dose of zomaten to help with her calcium and over the next few days remained relatively lethargic while we held some of her long acting opiates . she gradually began to improve and was able to tell if the worst pain was in the right clavicle . this was assessed promptly by an x-ray that confirmed pathologic fracture of that site . she also went on to have cervical , thoracic , and lumbosacral mris to confirm the wide spread bony metastases in the vertebral bodies and old degenerative changes perhaps with some indentation of the thecal sac but with no radiologic evidence for cord compression . she had had some urinary hesitancy and difficulty moving her legs in the first few days that had lead to the concern to _________ quinine syndrome but as soon as the opiates were tapered down she was able to void spontaneously and soon began to ambulate with the help of physical therapy . a single fraction to the collar bone seemed to help with pain . her bowels required fairly heavy duty osmotic laxatives to keep them open . the sudden plunge in such a dependent state left her quite depressed and ultimately a small dose of dexedrine was started partly to overcome the sedation of the opiates and perhaps improve her mood since more traditional antidepressants would take four to six weeks . plan : escalate the doses of the dexedrine perhaps up to a maximum of 10 mg at 8 o'clock in the morning and another 10 mg around noon and see if she can get reasonable sleep at night on this schedule , adding on remeron at night time for sleep as an antidepressant would be a possibility or to go right to a conventional ssri overlap until it seems to show more affect . she lives with her elderly husband and he was appropriately overwhelmed by the prospect of caring for her single-handedly , hence the transfer to a skilled nursing facility for a week or two of rehab . the patient and husband clearly expressed during this visit that she would not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation and ventilator support in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest . she was begun on letrazole as an ____________ inhibitor for her breast cancer and discussions were begun to consider a possible course or two of xeloda perhaps at a dose reduced scheduled if she continues to make progress in rehab and can return to dr. first 's office to have further discussions of this later approach

peritubal and periovarian adhesions . the patient now presents with a three to four week history of shortness of breath and a dry non-productive cough . she was evaluated by dr. mielke , a pulmonologist , who found her to be wheezing and performed pulmonary function tests which showed an fev1 of 1.1 and an fvc of 1.8 . she was admitted to weekscook university medical center with a

and possible ectopic p . hospital course : the patient was admitted for a new pericardial effusion which was felt most likely to be secondary to metastatic cervical cancer . there was no evidence of tamponade . an echocardiogram was scheduled and cardiology was consulted . echocardiogram showed moderate anterior pericardial effusion of approximately 600 cc with diastolic indications of the right ventricle and low velocity paradox . cardiology did not feel that tamponade at this time was a concern and that a tap need not be performed . she continued to have pulmonary wheezing , unknown origin , without history of asthma . her steroids were tapered and pulmonary was consulted who recommended a ct scan of the chest to evaluate the lung parenchyma , induce sputum for cbc , arterial blood gas , continuing of the beta agonist inhalers , and trial of steroid inhalers . they felt it was most likely a malignant lymphangitic spread with pericardial involvement versus infectious , other cardiovascular causes , or viral bronchiolitis . she had pulmonary function tests repeated which showed an fev1 of 36% of predicted and fvc of 56% of predicted . room air arterial blood gas showed a ph of 7.45 , po2 of 63 , a pco2 of 41 , and fairly significant aa gradient . she was continued on two liters of oxygen awaiting her ct scan on 06/14 and she developed a new junctional rhythm with a question of a new rub versus murmur on examination . cardiology felt she had a rub and her pulsus was still 10 . ekg showed an ectopic low atrial p and they thought she was still stable without evidence of tamponade . she should have a follow-up echocardiogram . echocardiogram showed left ventricle at the upper limits of normal for size , low normal function , moderate to mild effusion with pericardial pressures exceeding right atrial pressures , and right ventricular pressures at various points of patient 's cycle without any change in the effusion from 06/11 . thoracic surgery was also consulted and they felt that there was no need for a pericardial window at the time . she should be continued with pulmonary oximetry testing . she underwent her ct scan . this showed lymphangitic spread of cancer in the chest , question of pulmonary nodules in the chest , pericardial effusion , multiple liver metastases , decreased function of the left kidney , dilated left intrarenal collecting system and proximal ureter , and periaortic lymphadenopathy . pulmonary felt this was consistent also with lymphangitic spread and they did not feel that a bronchoscopy would be of any assistance at this time . chemotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer was discussed with the patient and she was started on 5-fu 800 mg per meter squared days 06/18 , 06/19 , and 06/20 . she also received cisplatin 35 per meter squared on 06/19 and ifex and mesna on 06/18 . she was noted , on 06/16 , to have numerous erythematous maculopapules on her back and chest . dermatology was consulted and they felt that this was most likely steroid acne . they therefore felt a rapid steroid taper was indicated and topical erythromycin if desired by the patient . the patient 's shortness of breath and wheezing continued but without change . her cardiac examination remained the same and there continued to be no evidence of tamponade . cardiology felt that follow-up echo was indicated on 06/18 as she had another echocardiogram which showed no change or evidence of tamponade . they therefore felt that she could be continued to be followed by examination . she had some mental status changes with confusion and hallucinations on 06/18 originating from narcotics versus decreased po2 . the ifex was held as it was felt that it could have precipitated the mental status changes and that she was to receive no further ifex . she had no further hallucinations since stopping the ifex . psychiatry was also consulted to help her with the changes she was feeling since her new diagnosis . she was hooked up with support services in collot ln , dugo , indiana 68961 for further counselling and given xanax for symptoms of anxiety . she continued to have no change in her shortness of breath or

then , dr. thorebreutz took him to the operating room , where he had quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting . he had a left internal mammary artery graft of the lad , a single saphenous vein to the right coronary artery with 280 cc per minute flow , and a saphenous vein snake graft to the diagonal and circumflex with 150 cc per minute flow . a paraphimosis was noted and treated by dr. ryna jescdrig . after surgery he had a ongoing sinus tachycardia . he was able to be rapidly weaned and extubated . he had good hemodynamics . he had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats . his intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the surgical intensive care unit . he was seen in consultation by the nutrition service , who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus . on 08/05 it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous heparin and indeed , when heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal . therefore , he does have a thrombocytopenic reaction to heparin . he remained in normal sinus rhythm . he did have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , which were clinically stable . he had a right bundle branch block . he is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction , but he is clinically stable on ace inhibitors , digoxin , coumadin , and aspirin . therefore he was able to be discharged home . he understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin times and his arrhythmias ;

diabetes . history of present illness : the patient is a 72 year old white male who was transferred from cay memorial hospital of for cardiac catheterization and electrophysiology studies . his cardiac risk factors include : hypercholesterolemia , hypertension and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus . he has a history of chest pain and in january 1993 underwent a cardiac catheterization at ph university of medical center which revealed an occluded right coronary artery with distal filling via left to right collaterals , a large left anterior descending with a 40-50% proximal stenosis and a co-dominant left circumflex with mild disease . he subsequently had an echocardiogram in december 1994 which showed normal left ventricular size and systolic function . he subsequently had an adenosine sestamibi in february 1997 which was negative for ischemia or infarction . in december 1994 he had a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia presenting with palpitations . he was diagnosed with wolfe parkinson white syndrome . he underwent an electrophysiology study which identified an accessory pathway with multiple attempts at ablation by dr. slusslashgodle which were unsuccessful . he was treated with sotalol for the supraventricular tachycardia . on 9/2/98 he was admitted to cay memorial hospital of with palpitations and was found to have an irregular wide complex tachycardia thought to be due to atrial fibrillation and conduction down his accessory pathway . he had mild congestive heart failure and was treated with an increased dose of lasix . an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 50% and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation . he was discharged home but returned on 9/13/98 with worsening palpitations on and off . he was again found to be in a wide complex tachycardia and was treated with magnesium . he denied any associated chest pain or dyspnea and he ruled out for a myocardial infarction . he continued to have intermittent runs of the wide complex tachycardia and was therefore transferred to ph university of medical center for further evaluation and management . prior to transfer he did have one episode of chest pain during the night without electrocardiogram changes . past medical history : hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus , depression , prostate cancer status post surgery . medications on admission : sotalol 160 mg bid . atenolol 25 mg bid . prilosec 20 mg qd . propulsid 10 mg qd . nph and czi insulin . resulin 400 mg qd . lisinopril 10 mg bid . aspirin . lasix 60 mg qd . allergies : he reports an allergy to both codeine and iodine . there was also a question of an allergy to prednisone which he said causes eye swelling . however , the details of this are quite uncertain and it is not clear if this was a true allergy . physical exam : he was comfortable with a blood pressure of 156/78 , pulse 56 and respirations of 16 . his lungs were clear throughout . his apical impulse was nondisplaced with a regular rate and rhythm , normal s1 and s2 but not s3 or s4 . there was a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border radiating to the apex . carotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally and there was no jugular venous distention . his abdomen was benign . femoral pulses were 2+ bilaterally without bruits and he had pedal edema bilaterally . laboratory data : bun 18 , creatinine 1.8 , magnesium 1.5 , cholesterol 154 with an hdl 41 , ldl 100 . his creatinine phosphokinase was 42 . his hematocrit was 49.3 . his electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with a delta wave and an intraventricular conduction delay consistent with wolf parkinson white syndrome . there were also nonspecific st-t wave abnormalities . hospital course and treatment : the patient clearly was suffering from atrial arrhythmias conducting down his bypass tract which were difficult to manage and causing symptomatic palpitations . given his known coronary artery disease and his recent heart failure and chest pain a cardiac catheterization was indicated prior to proceeding to an electrophysiology study . his initial cardiac catheterization had to be postponed given the possibility of an allergy to prednisone . he was seen by nnoatal hospital center who felt that he could be safely treated with solumedrol rather than prednisone together with benadryl and the use of low ionic contrast medium . accordingly the patient underwent uneventful cardiac catheterization on 9/17/98 which revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25 and a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 20 . his right coronary artery was occluded and filled distally via left to right collaterals . he had a 50% proximal left anterior descending stenosis and only minor disease to the left circumflex . his left ventriculogram showed preserved systolic function and mild mitral regurgitation . the patient then underwent an electrophysiology study on 9/20/98 . there was no inducible supraventricular tachycardia but he did have evidence of a left lateral bypass tract . mapping of the mitral anulus confirmed the location of the bypass tract . radiofrequency ablation was applied there and resulted in the elimination of the preoperatively-excitation . there were no complications . following the procedure there was no further evidence of wide complex tachycardia . he still did have occasional short runs of atrial tachycardia but there were no associated palpitations . in following up his ablation he underwent a holter monitor which showed normal sinus rhythm at rates of 40 to 80 . there were 15 atrial runs the longest of which was 13 beats at a rate of 100 . he also underwent a post-procedural echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 61% with mild mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement at 45mm . following the procedure his qt interval was noted to be prolonged to approximately .55 seconds . his sotalol was therefore decreased to 120 mg bid and his qt and qtc intervals decreased to .45-.48 seconds . after the procedure he was started on heparin and loaded on coumadin for a period of the next 3-4 weeks following radiofrequency ablation . his inr was 2.3 prior to discharge and he was scheduled to follow-up with the anticoagulation clinic to follow his coumadin dose . finally , his dementia appeared to worsen following receiving medications for agitation during his ep study . accordingly he was seen by neurology who felt that there was no evidence of a secondary process . he did have a head ct which showed no evidence of a

urine cultures with only positive culture a blood culture on november 20 , with one of two bottles positive for coagulase negative staphylococcus . a repeat cmv hypercapture , negative for presence of cmv . a repeat cat scan of the sinuses with finding of progressive thickening of the left maxillary sinus and both sets of ethmoid air cells since prior study of november 9 , indicating progressive infection of acanthamoeba and any possible superinfection with bacterial sinusitis . in the days following admission , there was clear evidence for progression of erythematous nodules over both arms and right thigh at foci of acanthamoeba infection , suggesting progressive skin involvement with acanthamoeba . infectious disease consult was obtained and recommendation was to switch from voriconazole to itraconazole , on which there was more existing data on treatment of acanthamoeba infection . pentamidine intravenous and nasal washings were continued . clinical progression of skin and sinus infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy continued , with emergence on november 20 of a new right-sided ptosis in association with a left homonymous hemianopsia , and fleeting confusion while febrile , prompting head mri which revealed a large 5 x 2 x 4.3 cm region in the right occipital lobe of hemorrhage and edema , with dural and , likely , leptomeningeal enhancement in association with small foci in the right cerebellum and pons , concerning for early lesions of similar type . idiosyncratic reaction to cyclosporine was considered as cause for cerebritis , and cyclosporine was discontinued . however , much more likely explanation is progressive infection of acanthamoeba with new neurologic involvement . most likely source of fevers was judged to be progressive acanthamoeba infection , even on maximal antimicrobial therapy . a single blood culture positive for coagulase negative staphylococcus was treated with a course of vancomycin in the setting of a picc line and a chest x-ray on november 20 indicating possible developing pneumonia , resulted in a course of levofloxacin , for both possible pneumonia , as well as treatment of any bacterial superinfection of acanthamoeba sinusitis . patient experienced steady decline , with persistent fevers despite all above measures , progressive areas of skin infection , more frequent episodes of confusion , and decreasing oxygen saturation in the setting of bilateral effusion , in the setting of fluid surge spacing . on november 30 , a family meeting with patient 's daughter and spouse , along with primary oncologist , dr. tomedankell bile , attending physician , dr. mellerny close , and house staff , was held to discuss patient 's critical condition and inability to prevent progression of skin , sinus and neurological acanthamoeba infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy . decision was made to withdraw aggressive measures of care , with priority on patient 's comfort . pentamidine , itraconazole , levaquin , acyclovir and gcsf were discontinued , along with other medications nonessential to patient 's comfort . dnr / dni status initially established early during hospital stay remained in effect . the patient was made comfortable with morphine for pain and for air hunger , and sinus suctioning was continued to relieve congestion , in conjunction with continuation of nasal sprays . tylenol was continued to control fevers and prednisone was continued to control inflammation and prevent precipitation of adrenal insufficiency . such measures have been continued through december 3 , and patient remains comfortable through this time . this interim dictation to be followed by an addendum detailing end of hospital course . dictated by : shaa kacholera
