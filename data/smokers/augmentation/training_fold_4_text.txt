factors include hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , tobacco use and a positive family history . he was a previously healthy male who reports a pattern of intermittent chest pain during the week prior to admission . on the night prior to admission he was awakened from sleep with severe substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm , accompanied by back pain at about 9:30 p.m. he was taken to the pre health emergency room and at about 2:45 a.m. on 7/30 an electrocardiogram demonstrated 3 to 4 mm st elevations in leads v1 to v4 and 2 mm st elevations in lead v5 . he was treated with nitroglycerin , antacids and intravenous morphine . he was transferred to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital hemodynamically stable . he arrived in the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital emergency room with a blood pressure of 120/80 , heart rate 90 . an electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 with premature ventricular contractions . it was notable for 4 to 7 mm st elevations throughout the precordium with qs in leads v1 and v2 , with 2 mm st elevations in avl and 1 to 2 mm reciprocal st depressions in leads ii , iii and avf . the initial physical examination was notable for bright red blood per rectum . he was treated with intravenous nitroglycerin , intravenous morphine , aspirin , ativan and a lidocaine drip . because of the noted bright red blood per rectum , thrombolysis was deferred and the patient was taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory . past medical history : notable only for surgical repair of an ulcer and a remote appendectomy . medications on admission : none allergies : penicillin , which gives him a rash . social history : his habits include smoking one pack per day for many years and moderate to heavy alcohol use . physical examination : the patient was an elderly appearing male in no significant distress . his pulse was 84 and regular , blood pressure 114/70 . the head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable . the neck was supple . the carotids were of normal amplitude without bruits . on cardiac examination he had a nonpalpable left ventricular impulse , a quiet s1 and s2 , no murmurs . he had an audible s3 and a jugular venous pressure of 8 . on lung examination he had rales one third up bilaterally . his abdomen was soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly , no guarding and no rebound . on rectal examination he had bright red blood in the vault without any stool . his extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis or edema . laboratory data : the hematocrit was 44.9 , white blood count 14.3 , platelet count 301,000 , sodium 138 , potassium 3.7 , chloride 102 , co2 27.4 , bun 12 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 147 . the electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 , left atrial enlargement , st elevations in v4 through v6 , i and avl , consistent with acute anterolateral myocardial infarction with q waves in v1 to v3 and reciprocal st depressions in leads ii , iii and afv . the chest x-ray showed a normal cardiac and mediastinal silhouette , mild pulmonary edema and an elevated left hemidiaphragm . hospital course : the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where hemodynamic measurements included a right atrial pressure of 7 , a right ventricular pressure of 33/8 , pulmonary artery pressure 29/16 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 16 . he had a proximal 95% left anterior descending lesion and mild to moderate disease in the first obtuse marginal . the left anterior descending lesion was angioplastied to a 30% residual stenosis . an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in the left groin prophylactically . the patient was hemodynamically stable throughout and was transferred to the micu . on hospital day 2 the intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned . the patient was intermittently agitated while on the intra-aortic balloon pump and was treated presumptively for alcohol withdrawal with serax . the lidocaine drip was rapidly weaned as well . on the third hospital day the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed . the intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin were weaned off . after removal of the intra-aortic balloon pump the patient was noticeably less agitated . on the fourth hospital day an attempt was made to transfer the patient to the floor . however , after a single dose of 25 mg of po metoprolol , the patient 's blood pressure dropped to the 60/40 range and he was therefore kept in the micu . the peak cpk level was on the second hospital day and was 5,042 with 26.7% mb fraction . on the fifth hospital day the patient was considered stable for transfer to the floor . once on the floor the patient had no recurrent chest pain . an echocardiogram was performed on the sixth hospital day which demonstrated an ejection fraction of 44% . on transfer to the medical floor the patient was noted to have guaiac negative stool . he was evaluated by the gi service who felt that , given the patient 's course , he could undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy electively at some point in the future . the patient underwent exercise stress testing with thallium on the ninth hospital day . he exercised for 7 minutes and 30 seconds , achieving 80% of the maximal heart rate on the modified bruce protocol . he did not have chest pain . there were st and t wave abnormalities with 2.5 mm horizontal depressions at the beginning of 3 minutes of exercise , which persisted into recovery . the thallium images showed fixed anterior and septal wall defects without any definite evidence of redistribution . based on this data , on the tenth hospital day the patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization which demonstrated a patent left anterior descending site , a circumflex lesion after the third obtuse marginal , and a distal posterior descending artery lesion with a tight stenosis and a small vessel . these findings were considered not to be hemodynamically significant and the patient was therefore to be discharged on medical therapy including nitrates and aspirin . because of his persistently marginal blood pressure at 100/70 , an ace inhibitor which was tried briefly and a beta blockers were elected not to be continued . the patient was discharged in stable condition on the eleventh hospital day . discharge diagnoses : 1. acute myocardial infarction . 2. lower

toxicity , as well as gvhd and recent cmv infection , readmitted for new fever , increasing creatinine , hepatomegaly and fluid surge spacing , in the setting of hyponatremia . patient initially presented in 1991 with cervical lymphadenopathy , was treated with mace / cytabom , and did well until 1997 , when he received six cycles of fludarabine for progressive disease . in november , 2001 , he progressed to leukemic phase , received rituxan and cvp . started campath in july , 2001 , complicated by lymphopenia / neutropenia and cmv infection , and underwent mud stem cell transplant in december , 2002 . the patient had bone marrow biopsy , august , 2003 , for persistent pancytopenia , revealing mild hypercelluarity with 80% leukemic cells . he was again treated with campath , had recurrent fever in association with sinus symptoms , with ct scan showing left maxillary sinusitis in association with new skin nodules on right elbow and buttocks . patient was hospitalized september 26 to november 11 for what was diagnosed by skin biopsy and sinus washings as acanthamoeba infection of skin and sinuses , without any progression to neurologic infection ( as assessed by head ct and mri ) . id consult was obtained and he was initially treated with azithromycin , itraconazole , and pentamidine , with progression of skin infection . subsequent discontinuance of azithromycin , trial of 5-fc , with increasing neutropenia requiring discontinuance , change if itraconazole to voriconazole , given continued neutropenia , and trial of sulfadiazine , discontinued for increasing ars . patient was maintained on p.o. voriconazole and iv pentamidine , with pentamidine nasal washings , with re-ct of sinuses near end of stay showing no change in disease burden . he has had recurrent cmb infection in the setting of campath therapy , requiring iv foscarnet therapy during stay , with inability to tolerate valganciclovir maintenance suppression subsequently due to increasing ars . hypercapture near end of stay was negative . patient experienced acute renal failure on chronic renal insufficiency , with previous baseline creatinine 1.6 , felt to be due to medication toxicity , requiring kayexalate and phoslo to manage electrolytes , but never any need for hemodialysis , with mild improvement of creatinine by discharge , with peak creatinine 3.4 , discharge creatinine 2.6 . patient struggled with gvhd , with extensive skin involvement , taking cellcept , prednisone and cyclosporine at time of last admission . cellcept was discontinued in the setting of infection , but attempts to decrease prednisone or cyclosporine were unsuccessful . patient returns from rehabilitation after discharge on november 11 , with new fever up to 102.0 in dsci clinic , increasing hepatomegaly as assessed by examination in clinic , and increasing creatinine . patient reports no significant changes in how he feels over the past week . denies cough , shortness of breath , chest

1.1 , albumin 2.6 , white blood cell count 2.0 , hematocrit 30.5 , platelets 60 . hospital course : patient was admitted for diagnosis and treatment of new fever . workup on admission included a chest x-ray negative for pneumonia , an mri of the liver to investigate for focal lesion , with no evidence for abscess or focal lesion on report . blood and urine cultures with only positive culture a blood culture on november 20 , with one of two bottles positive for coagulase negative staphylococcus . a repeat cmv hypercapture , negative for presence of cmv . a repeat cat scan of the sinuses with finding of progressive thickening of the left maxillary sinus and both sets of ethmoid air cells since prior study of november 9 , indicating progressive infection of acanthamoeba and any possible superinfection with bacterial sinusitis . in the days following admission , there was clear evidence for progression of erythematous nodules over both arms and right thigh at foci of acanthamoeba infection , suggesting progressive skin involvement with acanthamoeba . infectious disease consult was obtained and recommendation was to switch from voriconazole to itraconazole , on which there was more existing data on treatment of acanthamoeba infection . pentamidine intravenous and nasal washings were continued . clinical progression of skin and sinus infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy continued , with emergence on november 20 of a new right-sided ptosis in association with a left homonymous hemianopsia , and fleeting confusion while febrile , prompting head mri which revealed a large 5 x 2 x 4.3 cm region in the right occipital lobe of hemorrhage and edema , with dural and , likely , leptomeningeal enhancement in association with small foci in the right cerebellum and pons , concerning for early lesions of similar type . idiosyncratic reaction to cyclosporine was considered as cause for cerebritis , and cyclosporine was discontinued . however , much more likely explanation is progressive infection of acanthamoeba with new neurologic involvement . most likely source of fevers was judged to be progressive acanthamoeba infection , even on maximal antimicrobial therapy . a single blood culture positive for coagulase negative staphylococcus was treated with a course of vancomycin in the setting of a picc line and a chest x-ray on november 20 indicating possible developing pneumonia , resulted in a course of levofloxacin , for both possible pneumonia , as well as treatment of any bacterial superinfection of acanthamoeba sinusitis . patient experienced steady decline , with persistent fevers despite all above measures , progressive areas of skin infection , more frequent episodes of confusion , and decreasing oxygen saturation in the setting of bilateral effusion , in the setting of fluid surge spacing . on november 30 , a family meeting with patient 's daughter and spouse , along with primary oncologist , dr. tomedankell bile , attending physician , dr. mellerny close , and house staff , was held to discuss patient 's critical condition and inability to prevent progression of skin , sinus and neurological acanthamoeba infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy . decision was made to withdraw aggressive measures of care , with priority on patient 's comfort . pentamidine , itraconazole , levaquin , acyclovir and gcsf were discontinued , along with other medications nonessential to patient 's comfort . dnr / dni status initially established early during hospital stay remained in effect . the patient was made comfortable with morphine for pain and for air hunger , and sinus suctioning was continued to relieve congestion , in conjunction with continuation of nasal sprays . tylenol was continued to control fevers and prednisone was continued to control inflammation and prevent precipitation of adrenal insufficiency . such measures have been continued through december 3 , and patient remains comfortable through this time . this interim dictation to be followed by an addendum detailing end of hospital course . dictated by : shaa kacholera stonge , m.d. ln00 attending : la k. ski , m.d. of1

normocephalic / atraumatic , extraocular movements are intact , pupils equal , round and reactive to light and accommodation . chest had diffuse crackles bilaterally halfway up . coronary - irregular pvcs , s1 , s2 normal , positive systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border radiating throughout . abdomen was distended , tympanitic , mildly tender epigastrium and right lower quadrant . no rebound or guarding . extremities had 2+ bilateral lower extremity edema to knees . no clubbing or cyanosis . neurologic examination - alert and oriented x 3 , slurred and slow speech , distractable . cranial nerves ii through xii are intact . sensory is intact to soft touch throughout . strength is 5/5 throughout . laboratory data : white blood count 4.36 , hematocrit 26.1 with platelets of 107,000 , mcv 81 . sodium 137 , potassium 4.5 , chloride97 , bicarb 24 , bun 124 , creatinine 4.1 , glucose 144 , ast 49 , alt33 , alkaline phosphatase 253 , total bili 1.6 , calcium 9.2 , magnesium 2.3 , albumin 3.4 . hospital course : 1. gastrointestinal . the patient had an elevated bilirubin on admission with decreased output of biliary drain . the drain was replaced over the wire , 8-10 by ir , when it was accidentally removed . increased flow again . the patient had signs and symptoms develop of sbp , also with an elevated white count . he was treated broadly with amp , levo and flagyl . cultures were negative and onlyon one gram stain did it show rare gram negative rods . the patient 's abdominal fluid cell counts showed 2400 white blood cells , 500 red cells with 82 polyps , 11 lymphs , 7 monos . clinically , this was consistent with sbp , although unfortunately , fluid was never sent for cytology and a lot of those white cells are most likely due to his cancer . he underwent abdominal paracentesis approximately two times a week for therapeutic . this had to be performed by ir because the pocket was too deep to access from the bedside . he received a two week course of broad spectrum antibiotics and will be maintained on levofloxacin iv for prophylaxis against sbp . 2. pulmonary . from a pulmonary standpoint , he continued to complain of shortness of breath . his apical pneumothorax from the outside hospital had resolved . chest xray was consistent with pleurodesis . however , with persistent abdomen distention , there is likely restrictive deficit and , in addition , after each tap , he at times became hypotensive and with some mild fluid resuscitation decompensated with pulmonary edema , requiring both albumin and lasix to try to mobilize third space fluids . on the day of discharge , he is stating approximately 91 to 92% on three to four liters . chest xray is still consistent with volume overload . the plan will be to continue to try to alternate albumin and lasix to mobilize his fluid . 3. cardiovascular . he had episodes of bradycardia without subsequent fall in blood pressure at the beginning of his admission . he was ruled out for a myocardial infarction . echocardiogram showed 50% ejection fraction with mild mitral regurgitation . he did not show any episodes of bradycardia throughout the remainder of his hospital course . 4. endocrine . diabetes . his avandia was discontinued secondary to the side effect profile . he is being maintained on glipizide and sliding scale insulin . 5. heme . from a heme standpoint , he presented anemic and with an elevated pt inr . he required a few transfusions during his hospital course . he also required ffp initially to reverse his coagulopathy . however , this resolved on its own over the hospital course . his inr normalized , however , unfortunately , he developed bilateral deep venous thromboses during his hospital course and will be maintained on lovenox . 6. renal . he had a creatinine of 4.0 on admission and this decreased down to the mid ones with fluid , currently at 1.7 on discharge . from his urinalysis , he has mostly a prerenal state . however , he does require diuresis to prevent increased volume overload in his lungs from his hypoalbunemic state . at the time , nutrition was following , initially with a low fat , low cholesterol , low sugar diet . his appetite is decreasing somewhat as his disease process progresses , therefore , we have liberalized his diet for him to take what he wishes . 7. id . please see gi . he was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for a 14 day course for clinical sbp . he will be maintained on levofloxacin for prophylaxis against sbp . given that he will need continued taps, 8. oncology . the patient initially came for workup of pancreatic cancer with a questions of palliative chemotherapy . however , given his rapid clinical decline , this was deferred and i do not suspect that he will be a candidate for this , as the degree of his decline bodes a poor prognosis for him . his pain here has been controlled , initially on oxycontin with morphine for breakthrough pain . as he becomes progressively more somnolent , this will likely need to be switched to iv pain medications only . discussion , at that point in time , should occur with the family about comfort measures and about weaning him from his medications to make him more comfortable . code status - the patient is a dnr / dni . this is an unfortunate case but mr. po does have an incredibly supportive family who have been here consistently to visit him and that offers him an important source of comfort . discharge medications : tylenol , 650 mg p.o. q 4 prn ; allopurinol , 100 mg p.o. q.d. ; peridex mouthwash , 10 ml b.i.d.; cholysteramineresin , 4 grams p.o. q.d. ; clotrimazole , one troche p.o. q.i.d. ; fentanyl patch , 100 mcg per hour topical q 72 hours ; glipizide , 10 mg p.o. q.d.; atarax , 25 operating table 50 mg p.o. q 6 to 8 hours prn itching ; regular sliding scale insulin ; kbl mouthwash , 15 ccp .o. q.d. prn mouth discomfort ; lactulose , 30 ml p.o. q.i.d. that was started on january 30 , for no bowel movements with instructions to continue until bowel movement and then decrease to b.i.d. or q.d. ; lidocaine , 2% , 10 ml ur q 3 to 4 hours prn for pain around foley site ; ativan , 0.25 to 0.5 mg iv q 4 to 6 hours prn anxiety with instructions to use caution . the patient gets very somnolent with ativan . maalox plus , extra strength , 15 cc p.o. q 6 hours prn indigestion ; magnesium sulfate ; sliding scale iv and potassium chloride , sliding scale iv . he is also on reglan , 10 mg p.o. q h ; miracle topical cream to affected area ; also sarna , topical cream , b.i.d. he has nystatin suspension mouthwash , 10 cc swish and swallow q.i.d. he gets serax , 15 to 30 mg p.o. q h.s. prni nsomnia . ocean spray q.i.d. to nares prn nasal dryness . multivitamin , one tab q.d. morphine immediate release , msir , 15 to 30 mg p.o. q 2 to 3 hours prn pain . he is also on a fentanyl patch , 100 mcg q 72 hours . the morphine is for breakthrough pain . hydrocortisone , 1% topical cream q 6 to 8 hours prn itching . levofloxacin , 250 mg p.o. q.d. ; albuterol and atrovent nebs q 4 to6 hours as needed prn wheeze . plan for followup : follow up will be with dr. a flow from stromware st. , balt who is the patient 's primary oncologist there . dictated by : jimcharl b. vergeflow , m.d. xx14 attending : lupevickette flow , m.d. ya80 qo567/192247 batch : 8798 index no. qfqyrb7 agg d : 01/30/01 t : 01/30/01

principal diagnosis : dilated cardiomyopathy . associated diagnosis : interstitial lung disease , mitral regurgitation , systolic hypertension , status post myocardial infarction , transurethral resection of prostate , inguinal hernia repair , shingles , cataracts , ulcer disease , gout , mediastinal mass , thymoma . principal procedure : right heart catheterization . adverse drug reactions : none . clinical infections : none . history of present illness : mr. nertland is an 84-year-old man who was admitted with decompensated heart failure . the patient has a long standing history of significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis . he was recently hospitalized at the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital for repeat cardiac catheterization . after a comprehensive assessment , drs. sieh and shufffyfe did not recommend operative repair of severe mitral regurgitation or aortic stenosis . he was thus discharged with plans for continued medical therapy of his coronary artery disease . unfortunately , the patient continued to deteriorate and was readmitted for an attempt at hemodynamic tailoring and possible inotropic support . past medical history : is notable for above . for long standing dilated cardiomyopathy , severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 by previous catheterization . the patient had limited coronary artery disease with an occluded right coronary artery collateralized from the left system . physical examination : the patient was a well appearing pleasant man who was dyspneic on the examining table . initial blood pressure was 95/65 , heart rate 80 and regular . respiratory rate was 14 . jugular venous pressure was 7 with modest hepatojugular reflex . the carotids were 2+ and the lungs were notable for diminished breath sounds with inspiratory rhonchi . the point of maximum impulse was displaced and the first and second heart sounds were unremarkable with a 2/6 murmur of mitral regurgitation . there was no s3 gallop . abdomen was soft and non-tender and the rest of the examination was notable only for a slightly diminished pulses and poor perfusion . laboratory data : notable for a sodium of 144 , potassium 3.7 , bun 43 , creatinine 1.8 , albumin 3.0 , hematocrit 36 , white count 9.5 , platelet count 254 and a negative urinalysis . a chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with modest edema and the electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation , previous inferior apical infarct and right bundle branch block . hospital course and treatment : the patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent right heart catheterization which revealed a right atrial pressure of 11 , pulmonary artery pressure of 55/25 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 26 and a cardiac output of 2.7 liters per minute . the pa line was kept in place while the patient was admitted to the coronary care unit where he underwent an attempt at hemodynamic tailoring . initially nipride was begun with some augmentation of the cardiac index but eventually a fall of the cardiac index to 1.8 . the patient was then begun on milrinone to a dose of .4 mcg. per kg. per minute with improvement in his cardiac index to approximately 2.0 and a corresponding fall in his filling pressures . because of the increased ectopy that appeared to be temporally associated with this infusion , the patient was switched to dobutamine and titrated to a dose of 250 mcg. per minute . on dobutamine the cardiac index was 2.4-2.7 and at the end of his hemodynamic tailoring which included vigorous diuresis and the addition of isordil and captopril back to his chronic medical program , the patient 's right atrial pressure was 6 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 9 and the cardiac index was 2.7 . systemic vascular resistance was 900 . the patient was then decannulated and sent to the floor with improvement in his central hemodynamics . over the subsequent days of his hospitalization , the patient had adjustment of his diuretic program . at discharge his goal weight will be 120 pounds and he will be maintained on a chronic dobutamine infusion at 250 mcg. per minute . should he tachy phylax to this which is inevitable , he will be begun on a home milrinone infusion per previous protocol . the patient on the dose of dobutamine noted , had little in the way of resting symptoms and was without paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and orthopnea and able to ambulate approximately 100-150 feet without dyspnea . medications on discharge : lasix 20 mg. q.day . isordil 10 mg. t.i.d. aldactone 25 mg. q.d. digoxin .125 mg. q.d. plavix 75 mg. q.d. allopurinol 100 mg. q.d. serevent and flovent

isocoric cataract bilaterally . mouth : mucous membranes slightly dry . no oral ulcers . neck : supple . jugular vein not engorged . carotid pulses bounding very strongly . no thyromegaly . chest examination showed some basilar crackles at the right lung base . heart initially tachycardia , grade ii / vi systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border . abdomen : soft . liver and spleen were not palpable . bowel sounds normoactive . extremities : traced pitting edema . no cyanosis and no clubbing . peripheral pulses were very strong and bounding . no calf tenderness . homan 's sign

scan showed a cavitary lung lesion in the right lower lobe compatible with metastatic or septic embolus . ekg showed atrial fibrillation , left axis deviation , lvh , nonspecific st-t changes either due to digitalis affect . ck enzymes 146 . repeated three times and remained flat . troponin i on the second day of admission was 1.18 . hospital course : after admission , urology , nephrology as well as interventional radiology was consulted about the management of this patient . the specialist concluded that because the patient 's hematuria seemed to be stable and hematocrit to maintain at about 29-30 , there is no urgent need to do an arteriogram which may cause further damage to the patient 's kidney . urology consultation thinks that cystoscopy would not add any benefit to the management and only would consider a right nephrostomy if renal function failed to improve . after admission , the patient was treated conservatively to correct his electrolyte and metabolic acidosis . he was given blood transfusion , two units when his hematocrit dropped to 29.4 . after transfusion , the patient 's hematocrit rose to 37.7 on the day of discharge . the patient was also given sodium bicarbonate to correct his metabolic acidosis . he continued to pass about 1500-2000 cc of urine a day and his renal function improved slowly with creatinine decreased to 4.2 on the day of discharge . during this admission , the patient also developed atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of about 70-80 . cpk was tracked , but was totally normal . no beta blockers were given . a long discussion amongst the specialist , nephrology , urology , interventional radiology , primary oncology as well with the family lead to the conclusion that conservative management may give the patient more comfort than crisis treatment in this well advanced prostate ca . dr. lucreamull discussed the patient 's clinical status and overall situation with the patient 's family and the family decided that mr. prehekote could return home with hospice . the patient 's primary care physician , dr. tomedankell flowayles will manage the hospice issues . the patient was discharged to home for

he is a former professor at montana . tobacco ; he has some distant history of some very minimal use . alcohol ; he has no recent use . he was a previous drinker of one " old fashioned " every night . family history : he has a father who had dementia . there was no history of strokes or bleeding disorders in the family . physical examination : vital signs in the emergency room were 210/100 for blood pressure , heart rate 70 and irregular . he was afebrile . in general he was an intubated elderly frail appearing white male with blood about his face . head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination ; abrasions about his forehead , there was some minimal swelling associated . his neck was rigid ; 1+ carotids without bruits . oropharynx was intubated with blood as well . lungs ; clear to auscultation bilaterally . cardiovascular examination ; regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops . abdominal examination ; soft , non-tender , non-distended , normal active bowel sounds . extremities : no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema . neurologically ; he opens his eyes to voice . he does not regard the examiner . he had no blink to threat . his pupils were three down to two on the right and five down to four on the left . according to the family this iansicoria was old . he had intact corneals bilaterally and intact horizontal dull movements bilaterally . he had left greater than right nasal stimulation to grimace . he had no gag to tube manipulation . motor examination he had a weak withdrawal to nail bed pressure in both hands . he triple flexed his bilateral lower extremities to pain . his deep tendon reflexes were 2+ at the right brachial radialis and right patella ; everywhere else his reflexes were 1 . his toes were down going . summary of laboratory and radiological examinations : sodium 141 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 107 , bicarbonates 23.8 , bun 23 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 165 , po2 377 , pco2 32 , ph 7.50 , asomus 298 , toxic screen negative , white blood cell count 11.1 , hematocrit 39.6 , platelet count 137 , prothrombin time 25.2 , inr 4.3 , partial thromboplastin time 34.7 , urinalysis 1+ albumin, 0-5 high link caths , cervical spine negative , pelvis negative , lumbar spine ; negative , thoracic spine negative . chest x-ray clear . electrocardiogram showed 2 mm of st depressions in v4-6 . head ct scan showed a 2 x 2 x 2 left anterior temporal hemorrhage with minimal surrounding edema . there was also evidence of an old right frontal infarction . hospital course and treatment : 1) neurology : the patient was admitted to the neurology intensive care unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition . he had an electroencephalogram performed on his initial admittance to the intensive care unit which did not show any evidence of seizure activity . it did , however , show diffuse slowing . he was given 1.5 grams of dilantin in the emergency room as well as 2 mgs of intravenous ativan which did little to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination . his hypertension ; his high blood pressure was controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine in the early going and then he was switched to an oral regimen for better control after he was removed from the intensive care unit . he continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his ability to move . he did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right , but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission . his diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was placed under question on further examination of his eye movement since he was able to have excellent superior gaze especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy . it was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process , but this was not clarified during this admission . it was not felt likely to be due to parkinson 's disease , as he had no significant response to eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of tremor , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic . he had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on october 18 , 1996 . this showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct , but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy . in addition , he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage , so tumor was felt to be unlikely . however , this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage . the etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out . 2) cardiovascular : his electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia . he was on intravenous tng and was supratherapeutic on his anti-coagulation . he did have a slight elevation of his tpk with an additional value of 198 with a mb fraction of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2.9 . that was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent ckmbs and was felt that he had a very small " leaflet " . he remained chest pain free throughout his admission . 3) pulmonary : after his initial intubation he remained quite stable . he was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex . however , he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission . 4) hematology : he had his prothrombin time reversed with vitamin k 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room . his anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation , but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed . it was decided that his goal inr was to be 2.0 . he did drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period , but his discharge inr was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time . it was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems . 5) gastrointestinal : he was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the ph university of medical center and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision . thus , his nasogastric tube was discontinued on october 19 , 1996 and he tolerated feeding quite well . in discussions with the family , given his age and number of medical problems , it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have a terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions . however , he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be a short term procedure . the family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good , but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary , short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest . disposition / plan on discharge : stable . doctor 's discharge orders : the patient was to be discharged to a rehabilitation hospital , the location of which was undetermined at this time of this discharge summary . the patient is to follow up with dr. ria in clinic on one month time and the family is to call me if there were any questions in the interim . medications on

principal diagnosis : adult respiratory distress syndrome . associated diagnosis : urinary tract infection , tracheostomy status , diabetes mellitus . history of present illness : mr. stain was transferred from the oreiewlefell merkane i penaltbridgesgreat university medical center for progressive respiratory failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome superimposed on a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , perhaps asthma , and ulcerative colitis . his only positive result was a sputum culture for pseudomonas and this came after he had already been on antibiotics . physical examination : the physical examination on transfer showed an alert male with temperature 100 degrees , blood pressure 120/64 , heart rate 80 . he was intubated with pressor support of 25 , and peep of 12.5 with 70% fio2 . tracheostomy tube was in good position . there was an audible air leak . his chest showed bilateral rhonchi . the abdomen was distended with active bowel sounds . the rectal examination was unremarkable . extremities showed trace pulmonary edema . laboratory data : a chest x-ray showed diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates , greater in the lower lung fields than in the upper . the ekg showed normal sinus rhythm at 83 , with an 11 degree axis , non-specific st-t wave changes . the sputum gram stain showed a few polys and no organisms . the blood gas showed a po2 of 56 , pco2 of 48 and ph of 7.47 . hospital course : the patient was seen in consultation by dr. wire who felt that manipulation of the tracheal tube was the best approach to the air leak since it was a new trach and he was requiring such high ventilator support that it was risky to change it . he also felt that lung biopsy at this time was rather risky . the patient was therefore completely cultured again and begun on antibiotic coverage which would take care of the pseudomonas he was known to have . the steroids were tapered . he was also begun on anti-candida regimen for his urinary tract infection with yeast being seen . because of the story of hemoptysis , he also underwent an exotic bleeding work up for such things as wegner 's and goodpasture 's . these results were all negative . he continued to require very high fio2 . he was found to have a dvt by ultrasound . he underwent a trial of tpa followed by heparin . this produced substantially further hemoptysis and the need for transfusion . he stabilized from this , but on the fifth while continuing to have extremely ventilator requirement . in consultation with his family , it was decided that enough support had been done . at that time , therefore , ventilator support was withdrawn under the comfort measures of morphine . stain j. a , m.d. tr : sj / bmot dd : 6-4-93 td : 06/05/93 cc :

identifying data : ms. qinbreun is a 74-year-old woman with severe multiple myeloma admitted for her second cycle of vincristine , adriamycin , and dexamethasone . she is currently dependent on dialysis . history of present illness : the patient was in good state of health until june of 1988 , at which time she began to experience back pain . she was initially treated with nsaids , however , with one week she began to feel quite ill and decreased p.o. intake . she was also noted to have increased nausea without any vomiting . she went to a local hospital , where she was found to be in acute renal failure with elevated calcium and very poor performance status . she was transferred to acoa cogville dibreswisser health , at which her creatinine was noted to be 10 with calcium 12 . she was started on dialysis and with good response . her renal ultrasound at the time revealed normal sized kidneys . further work up included an spep which revealed a monoclonal gammopathy . the total protein was noted to be 10.6 with a glybumin fraction of 6.9 . they did skeletal surveys there , as well , which revealed numerous small , fairly well defined lucencies within the skull , as well as within the pelvis . there were no fractures or lytic lesions noted . the doctors in orwood performed a bone marrow aspirate and the biopsy confirmed the diagnosis . the patient was noted to have greater than 90% of the marrow comprised of plasma cells and she was subsequently transferred to verg medical center . the patient was begun on a regimen of vincristine , adriamycin and dexamethasone . she tolerated the first cycle without any complications noted . the patient transferred her care to santusli hospital at pointexasp region general hospital where her renal needs were tended to by dr. pascuph . this hospitalization represents her second cycle of vad . past medical history : unremarkable . allergies : penicillin , which produces a rash . social history : she denies any tobacco . family history : she has a sister with alzheimer 's , and she has a daughter with breast cancer . medications : included iron , multivitamins , calcium , compazine , ativan , fentanyl patch , percocet . hospital course : the patient was admitted to pointexasp region general hospital for further management of her multiple myeloma and the renal failure . 1. multiple myeloma . the patient was started on a regimen of vincristine 0.4 mg a day times four days of continuous infusion , adriamycin 9 mg / m2 per day for four days of continuous infusion and dexamethasone 40 mg p.o. q day x four days . the patient was also dialyzed according to a tuesday , thursday , saturday regimen . the chemotherapy was well tolerated , and the patient was noted to be in good spirits throughout . the patient was also taking hemodialysis with no complications noted . the patient on day 5 of admission , after completing her second cycle of chemotherapy , was to be transferred to didelb hospital for further rehabilitation and care . on the day of discharge , the following was the patient 's physical exam . the patient was known to be a 74 year old woman in no acute distress , appearing about her stated age . she has diffuse alopecia secondary to chemotherapy . pupils equal , round , reactive to light . there was no scleral icterus . the nose and throat were clear . the neck revealed no adenopathy . there were no bruits , and there was no elevated jvp . heart examination revealed an s1 , s2 with no rubs , murmurs or gallops . the abdomen was benign . the extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema . the lungs were generally clear to auscultation bilaterally . on the day of discharge , the patient 's laboratory values are as follows . sodium 133 , potassium 3.8 , chloride 99 , bicarbonate 23 , bun 48 , creatinine 6.1 , glucose 102 . those are predialysis labs . the white blood cells are 12 , hemoglobin 8.8 , hematocrit 28 , mcv 83 , rdw 18.5 and platelets 274 . once again , those are pre-dialysis labs . assessment and plan : the patient is to follow up with dr. quown at santusli hospital on the 21st of october 1999 at 10:00 a.m. , and she is to continue her medications . discharge medications : calcium acetate 667 mg p.o. t.i.d. , peridex 10 ml b.i.d. , clotrimazole troche 1 troche p.o. q.i.d. , nystatin suspension 10 ml swish and swallow q.i.d. , prilosec 20 mg p.o. q day , oxycodone 5 to 10 mg p.o. q 6 hours , compazine 10 mg p.o. q 6 hours prn nausea , bactrim ds 1 tablet p.o. q monday , wednesday , friday , niferex tablets 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , nephrocaps tablets one tab p.o. q day . dictated by : ma meed , m.d. uv64 attending : telshey k. swatlleebtik , m.d. lu61 yi383/6739 batch : 3184 index no. x1sjan2vmd d : 10/02/98 t : 10/02/98 
principal diagnosis : congestive heart failure . associated diagnosis : aortic stenosis ; coronary artery disease , status post multi vessel coronary artery bypass graft surgery , severe left ventricular dysfunction , chronic renal insufficiency . allergies : sulfonamides . principal procedure : cardiac catheterization - 4/1/93 - two dimensional echocardiogram 3/27/93 . doctors discharge orders : lasix 40 mg qd ; digoxin 0.25 mg qd ; aspirin 325 mg qd ; isordil 10 mg tid . history of present illness : mr. breun underwent a six vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure in march , 1990 , following a complicated inferior posterior myocardial infarction . he had a very stormy course , dominated by post infarction angina pectoris , high grade atrial ventricular block , gastrointestinal bleeding , pneumonia , and no noliguric renal failure . an intra-aortic balloon pump was required for stabilization . he also had moderately severe aortic stenosis at that time with a peak aortic valve gradient of 30 , and a calculated valve area of 1.2 cm squared . despite the magnitude of these problems , he made a remarkable recovery over the course of several months , and was able to return to work on a part-time basis , after joining a program of cardiac rehabilitation . postoperatively , we measured a left ventricle ejection fraction of 40% , by gated cardiac blood pool scanning . over these past 3 years , he has remained stable , on a very simple program of aspirin , and atenolol . he returned for routine office evaluation on 3/25/93 , complaining of 2 months of progressive exertional dyspnea , with occasional chest discomfort , and , more recently , orthopnea , cough , peripheral edema , and weight gain . physical examination : weight 197 lbs , up 6 lbs , blood pressure 128/88 , heart rate 70 and regular . the venous pressure was markedly elevated to 15 cm . the carotids were of low volume , and sluggish bilaterally , with transmission of a basal heart murmur . there was dullness at both bases , with rales 1/3 way upon the right , and at the base on the left . the right ventricle , and left ventricle impulses were diffuse . there was a grade i-ii murmur of aortic stenosis , with additional murmurs of tricuspid , and mitral regurgitation , and an obvious s3 . the liver was enlarged 2 finger breadths below the right costal margin , and there was 1-2+ peripheral edema . his chest x-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly , with bilateral pleural effusions , right greater than left , and pulmonary vascular re-distribution . the electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with first degree av block , an old inferior myocardial infarction , and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction , and non-specific st-t wave abnormalities , that were unchanged compared to june , 1992 . later , an echocardiogram on 3/27/93 , demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with calcification of the annulus , and incomplete closure of the valve , consistent with papillary muscle dysfunction . the left atrium was dilated to 52 mm . the aortic valve was thickened , with restrictive motion , and there were indistinct mobile echo densities on the leaflets . there was evidence of trace aortic regurgitation , however , due to technical difficulties , accurate gradients could not be estimated . the left ventricle was dilated , with concentric hypertrophy , and multi segmental wall motion abnormalities , with a reduced ejection fraction of 24% . there was also doppler evidence of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary insufficiency . a persantine thallium scan on 3/31/93 , showed increased lung uptake , cavity dilatation and a large inferior , apical scar , without evidence of active ischemia . laboratory data : potassium 4.4 , bun and creatinine 33/1.7 , albumen 3.6 , total bilirubin 1.8 , direct bilirubin 0.5 , ck 162 , with 11.1 mb for a relative index of 6.9% . this was of uncertain significance . the hematocrit 43.2 , whiteblood count 9.2 , prothrombin time 10.4 , partial thromboplastin time 34.2 , urinalysis had 1+ albumen and 0-2 white blood cells , per high power field , with a culture that demonstrated rare enterococcus . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the medical service , and placed at bed rest , and given intravenous furosemide . over the course of the next few days , we succeeded in having his weight decrease from its value of 189 lbs , to as low as 177 1/2 lbs . coincident with this , his clinical condition improved markedly , and he became fully ambulatory . given the difficulties in trying to assess the exact mechanism by which his heart failure had occurred , we proceeded to cardiac catheterization on 4/1/93 . at the time of this study , the right atrial pressure was 1 , the pa pressure 32/10 , and the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 10 . there was a 40-50 mm peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve , a mean gradient of 40 , and a calculated valve area of 0.5 cm squared , using a cardiac output of 3.4 liters per minute . left ventriculography demonstrated marked left ventricle dilatation . there was mild mitral regurgitation , a posterior basil aneurysm , and akinesis of the apex , septum , and inferior walls . the anterior lateral wall was severely hypokinetic , and the posterior lateral wall moderately kinetic . the aortic valve was calcified with reduced excursion consistent with his aortic stenosis . a dominant right coronary artery had an 80% proximal stenosis , and was then occluded at the acute margin . a large right ventricular marginal branch did fill the saphenous vein graft in a retrograde fashion . the posterior descending artery had an 80% stenosis proximal to the insertion of the graft . the left anterior descending was proximally occluded , and the left circumflex had a 90% stenosis in the first marginal branch , and 90% stenosis distally in other branches . the saphenous vein graft to the right ventricular acute marginal and posterior descending artery was patent with good runoff . the saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending had a minor plaque at the distal anastomosis . the saphenous vein graft to three distal marginal branches was patent with good flow . certainly , the cardiac catheterization was consistent with severe aortic stenosis in the presence of profound left ventricular systolic dysfunction . these findings were reviewed with dr. patella and together we decided that conservative therapy would be the appropriate first choice in mr. breun 's management . his advanced age , prior cardiac surgery and advanced left ventricular dysfunction , together with his chronic renal insufficiency , would certainly complicate to an enormous degree any undertaking as risky as redo surgery for aortic valve replacement . percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty , on the other hand , would only be a temporary procedure and did not seem necessary even for transient symptomatic relief given his marked improvement following a rather conventional course of intravenous diuretics . it is very unlikely that we will offer mr. breun aortic valve replacement surgery in the future . he seems to agree with this particular approach as the quality of life has become very important and appropriate issue for him . he is looking forward to returning home and going back to work on a part time basis at the local pharmacy . we will see how far we can get with medical therapy although mr. wierst and his family clearly understand the long term implications of his aortic stenosis . ethelan kotefyfechird ,

mellitus , coronary artery disease or peptic ulcer disease . interestingly , she reports that both her mother and father died of stomach carcinoma . she is a former smoker , and drinks alcohol occasionally . physical examination : on physical examination she is an elderly but spry white female in no acute distress . her sclera were nonicteric . her oropharynx was clear . her neck was supple without masses or bruits noted . her lungs were clear to auscultation . her cardiac examination was unremarkable . examination of her abdomen revealed a flat nontender abdomen without palpable masses . there were multiple well healed surgical scars . she was guaiac negative . there was no cva tenderness or spinal tenderness noted . her pulses were intact throughout . laboratory data : sodium 139 , potassium 3.7 and bun of 19 . her hematocrit was 37.2 with a white blood count of 6.6 . her bilirubin direct and total were 0.1 and 0.3 respectively . her alkaline phosphatase was 134 . her electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm without acute ischemic changes . chest x-ray was unremarkable . the assessment at the time of admission was that of an 86 year old female with poorly

where she underwent a neart total gastrectomy with a retrocolic bill-roth ii gastrojejunostomy reconstruction . in addition a small ventral hernia was noted upon abdominal exploration within a previous surgical incision . this was repaired . a needle jejunostomy catheter was placed at the time of her operation to facilitate postoperative nutrition . with regards to the cancer , there was a large mass along the greater curvature in the body of the stomach , and several perigastric lymph nodes which were taken with the specimen . in addition , there were at least two lymph nodes within the porta hepatis which were dissected free and taken en bloc with the specimen . the remainder of her abdomen was unremarkable without evidence of metastatic spread elsewhere , including the liver . the patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in good condition . the patient 's postoperative course was for the most part unremarkable . her wounds healed well without

discharge diagnoses : 1. secondary neoplasm of bone ( extensive ) . 2. primary malignant neoplasm of the breast ( resected ) . 3. delirium ( adverse affects of opiates ) . 4. depression . 5. deconditioning . 6. anemia of chronic disease . 7. hypercalcemia . 8. history of perforated gastric ulcer treated with hemigastrectomy 03/2004 . operations and procedures : radiation therapy to the right clavicle 07/16/2004 . history of present illness : one of several puomc admissions for this 88-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer initially diagnosed in 1997 and treated with surgery , radiation , and hormonal treatment . she had actually completed her five years of tomaxifin , but was continuing to be plagued by menopausal symptoms and finally in the summery of 2004 understanding the obvious potential risks , she began an estrogen patch . not long afterwards she began to develop some bone pains which progressed over the late summer and fall requiring escalation of opiates and restaging confirmed the presence of metastases throughout her spine and in the base of her skull , ribs , arms , etc ... but no visceral involvement . she ultimately was admitted to the hospital because of delirium and difficulty controlling the pain . she had no fevers , chills , headaches , or neck stiffness . there had been no focal neurologic changes . up until this admission she had been relatively independent and was very dismayed to discover the extensive relapse of her disease . on admission to the hospital her temperature was 99 , heart rate 99 , blood pressure 151/87 , o2 saturation on room air was 92% . she did look mildly dyspneic . her lungs were clear . she had good range of motion throughout except for severe local tenderness and swelling on the mid third of her right clavicle which impaired right shoulder movement . she was oriented to place and name and this waxed and waned over the next couple of days . the rest of her neurologic exam was essentially intact . laboratory data : sodium of 137 , bun of 25 , creatinine of 0.9 , glucose of 77 , calcium slightly high at 10.9 with an albumin of 3.7 . bilirubin normal . her alt 11 , her ast slightly up at 59 . her alk phos slightly up at 174 . wbc 10.8 with normal differential . hemoglobin 12.2 , hematocrit 36.6 , mcv 89 , platelets 345,0000 . a urinalysis showed cloudy urine with 10-20 red cells and 20-50 white cells . a ca 153 was significantly elevated at 66.5 ( normal 0-30 ) . the patient was brought to the floor , hydrated gently , given another dose of zomaten to help with her calcium and over the next few days remained relatively lethargic while we held some of her long acting opiates . she gradually began to improve and was able to tell if the worst pain was in the right clavicle . this was assessed promptly by an x-ray that confirmed pathologic fracture of that site . she also went on to have cervical , thoracic , and lumbosacral mris to confirm the wide spread bony metastases in the vertebral bodies and old degenerative changes perhaps with some indentation of the thecal sac but with no radiologic evidence for cord compression . she had had some urinary hesitancy and difficulty moving her legs in the first few days that had lead to the concern to _________ quinine syndrome but as soon as the opiates were tapered down she was able to void spontaneously and soon began to ambulate with the help of physical therapy . a single fraction to the collar bone seemed to help with pain . her bowels required fairly heavy duty osmotic laxatives to keep them open . the sudden plunge in such a dependent state left her quite depressed and ultimately a small dose of dexedrine was started partly to overcome the sedation of the opiates and perhaps improve her mood since more traditional antidepressants would take four to six weeks . plan : escalate the doses of the dexedrine perhaps up to a maximum of 10 mg at 8 o'clock in the morning and another 10 mg around noon and see if she can get reasonable sleep at night on this schedule , adding on remeron at night time for sleep as an antidepressant would be a possibility or to go right to a conventional ssri overlap until it seems to show more affect . she lives with her elderly husband and he was appropriately overwhelmed by the prospect of caring for her single-handedly , hence the transfer to a skilled nursing facility for a week or two of rehab . the patient and husband clearly expressed during this visit that she would not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation and ventilator support in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest . she was begun on letrazole as an ____________ inhibitor for her breast cancer and discussions were begun to consider a possible course or two of xeloda perhaps at a dose reduced scheduled if she continues to make progress in rehab and can return to dr. first 's office to have further discussions of this later approach . discharge medications : zofran 8 mg p.o.

principal diagnosis : left lung atelectasis with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . associated diagnosis : bilateral mastectomy treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy . principal procedure : 1/13/94 - flexible bronchoscopy with biopsy , mediastinoscopy and biopsy , left pleural biopsy with excision of redundant left lower lobe emphysematous bullae ( reduction pneumoplasty ) . associated procedures : 2/14/94 - tracheostomy . history of present illness : mrs. scarv is a 70 year old female who presented with a two and a half year history of dyspnea and progressively worsening exercise tolerance . her work up included a cardiac catheterization which showed moderate disease and pulmonary function tests which showed an fev1 of .93 and a dlco of 5.12 . her x-rays and ct scans showed progressive infiltrate in the left lower lobe . she underwent bronchoscopy on 1/6/94 by the pulmonary service . she was admitted post-bronchoscopy because of dyspnea and pain . past medical history : ( 1 ) hysterectomy . ( 2 ) colonic polypectomy . ( 3 ) bilateral mastectomy treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy . medications on admission : prednisone 10 mg q.d. , atenolol 25 mg q.d. , cytotec 10 mg q.d. , zantac 150 mg b.i.d. physical examination on admission : respirations 22 , pulse 96 , systolic pressure 100 , head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination : sclerae nonicteric , perrl , mucous membranes not cyanotic , neck was supple , carotids were 2+ without bruits . the heart exam revealed a normal sl and s2 regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs . chest : decreased breath sounds at left base , crackles at both bases . the abdomen was soft and non-tender , no masses . extremities : slight cyanosis of fingers , no peripheral edema . admission laboratory data : room air blood gas 54/26/7.48 . electrolytes notable for potassium 4.2 , bun 28 , creatinine 1.0 , hematocrit 44.4 , white blood count 8.6 , chest x-ray post biopsy : tiny left apical pneumothorax without interval change . hospital course : early in through her hospitalization her electrocardiograms remained unchanged and she ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes . her oxygen saturations remained 88-93 percent on four liters of nasal prong oxygen . upon review of her computerized tomography scan there was demonstration of progressive collapse of her left lower lobe with a mass like effect adjacent to the atelectasis . there were two large mediastinal nodes and needle biopsy of the left lobe lesion was non-diagnostic . she was referred for tissue diagnosis and on 1/13/94 was brought to the operating room . she underwent flexible bronchoscopy with mediastinoscopy . these were negative for tumor and a mini left thoracotomy was performed with pleural biopsy . intraoperatively there was a large emphysematous portion of the left lung which prohibited her left lower lobe to fully expand . it was decided to perform reduction pneumoplasty . this proceeded uneventfully . she was extubated and stable with a good airway and good oxygen saturation . however , upon transferring her from the operating room bed to the stretcher she had an arrest . this appeared to be respiratory in origin . she was placed back on the operating room table and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun . pressors were given and she quickly responded with a return in blood pressure and heart rate . her blood pressure remained unstable requiring large amounts of pressors . x-rays showed no pneumothorax and there was no bleeding from her chest tubes . she was therefore transferred up to the respiratory intensive care unit . early in her postoperative course her pulmonary artery pressures were quite high , 70/30 . her wedge pressure was 20 and there were no electrocardiogram changes . she ruled out for myocardial infarction . she developed a picture consistent with right heart failure with pulmonary hypertension and require nitric oxide administration . this improved her right heart function with lower pa pressures . she developed a right pleural effusion which required chest tube placement to remove 1200 ccs of straw-colored fluid . she remained fully ventilated with marginal hemodynamic status on levophed , dobutamine and nitric oxide . ultimately she was able to be weaned off of her levophed as well as her nitric oxide . however , because of persistent episodes of right heart failure , dobutamine was started . this improved her cardiac function . she failed to wean from the ventilator and on 2/14/94 was brought to the operating room for a tracheostomy . she had a complicated course from an infectious disease standpoint with multiple positive cultures including sputum positive for pseudomonas cepacia , blood cultures which were positive for streptococcus milleri . the right pleural fluid was also positive for streptococcus milleri . she had citrobacter from her sinuses with evidence of sinusitis . she was treated with multiple courses of broad spectrum antibiotics . given her protracted postoperative course the family uniformly decided to withdraw all support and initiate comfort measures only . this was discussed with the respiratory intensive care unit staff . her support was withdrawn and she expired on 2/17/94 at 9:00 p.m. the patient 's family was notified . rielleus large , m.d. tr : siw / bmot dd : 02/17/94 td : 02/19/94

principal diagnosis : metastatic melanoma . principal procedure : wide resection of metastatic melanoma to the right shoulder with partial thickness skin graft reconstruction on 9/1/00 . history of present illness : this is a 69 year old man who was initially diagnosed with a right upper posterior extremity melanoma level 4 , 2.5 mm in depth , in 10/02/92 . subsequently in 10/92 he underwent a wide excision with axillary dissection which showed residual malignant melanoma with nine negative lymph nodes . he had a recurrence in 05/99 in a similar area which was 2.1 mm in thickness . he had this resected between 8/4 and 9/5/97 and was treated with 6000 c of radiation therapy over the right upper extremity . he has done well since that time and subsequently in 05/98 had pulmonary nodules which were noted and a computer tomogram scan in 08/98 demonstrated a 4.2 cm splenic lesion . he underwent an open splenectomy in the fall 1998 which demonstrated metastatic melanoma only to the spleen . since that time he has been treated with _______ cells in 1999 and also with allovecting injection to the right anterior axillary nodule . most recently in he has this right anterior axillary metastatic melanoma resected at brook hospital by dr. bainpruess on with local triceps myocutaneous tissue transfer . since april through july this area has increased in size where the triceps tissue transfer has been replaced with a bulky metastatic melanoma disease . surgical consultation for resection of this for local ___ control was requested . the patient has ___ dr. peakekudz and has known visceral metastases of the liver as well the lung with mediastinal adenopathy which has been stable for the past two years . the other complicating factor in his care was that he was wheelchair bound from a viral meningeal encephalomyelitis in 1966 and has relied heavily on his upper extremity for wheelchair transfer and access and transportation . in order to workup up this metastatic melanoma recurrent after local excision only two months previously it was elected to get an magnetic resonance imaging scan of the shoulder . this magnetic resonance imaging scan confirmed that there was a large mass which measured approximately 4-6cm anterior to the deltopectoral groove and unfortunately a smaller lesion 1cm was seen separately adjacent and medial to the biceps tendon near the brachial neurovascular bundle . an magnetic resonance imaging scan which was performed three months prior to admission to brook hospital for resection demonstrated that this more medial lesion was not present at that time and therefore it was suspicious for metastatic melanoma . the patient had a fine needle aspiration of this bulky tumor mass which demonstrated malignant melanoma and subsequently he was sent for a positron emission tomography scan which was performed at s nakantlakeing university hospital and medical center on 8/24/00 . the positron emission tomography scan demonstrated a known larger anterior metastatic melanoma and more medially two approximately 1cm lesions that also enhanced . these were consistent with metastatic melanoma near the brachial plexus confirmed by the magnetic resonance imaging scan . the patient now presents for surgical resection and reconstructive repair of this lesion . past medical history : viral meningeal encephalomyelitis in 1996 which left him paralyzed from waist down and wheelchair bound . he is incontinent of bowel and bladder and wears a texas catheter due to phimosis of the penis . he also suffered comminuted fractures of the right lower extremity . he has bilateral venous stasis and hypertension . past surgical history : as above including a splenectomy . medications on admission : 1. atenolol 25 mg po per day . allergies : bactrim . sulfa . intravenous pyelogram dye . social history : he works as a lawyer . he is active in general practice and is divorced with four daughter one of which is a neurologist who comes to visit him often . her name is dr. lynea moyduhe . family history : father with renal cell carcinoma and prostate cancer . mother with primary brain tumor . physical examination : afebrile , vital signs stable . his right shoulder had a large 6cm bulky mass which had grown somewhat in size over the past 2-3 weeks . the bulky mass is somewhat mobile on the medial aspect and there are subcutaneous nodules which had not been present before . the axillary area medially has two dominant nodules . hospital course : the patient underwent a wide excision of the malignant melanoma of his right shoulder and partial thickness skin grafting to his right axilla . the donor site was his right thigh . he tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications . a vac dressing was applied postoperatively and this was maintained for four days . when this was taken down the graft was noted to be healthy with good take . it was then dressed with adaptic and bacitracin ointment and covered with a dry sterile dressing per day . the harvest site was blown dry with a blow dryer . the patients pain was controlled initially with a pca and this was eventually discontinued and he was started on oxycontin . his foley was discontinued and a texas catheter was reapplied . he was tolerating a regular diet with regular bowel movements with digital rectal stimulation . he began to work with ot service . they began range of motion to his right upper extremity except for around his shoulder . this was kept to minimal activity . he remained afebrile with stable vital signs . on discharge his graft is clean , dry and intact without any evidence of discharge or erythema . his donor site is also without evidence of infection . condition on discharge : good . discharge instructions : regarding the patient 's physical activity status he is to be minimally weight baring of the right upper extremity . there is to be no range of motion to the right shoulder but active range of motion to the rest of his right upper extremity . he is not to transfer to a wheelchair using his upper arm . diet is regular . for dressings , an adaptic with bacitracin should be applied to the shoulder graft per day . this should be covered with a dry sterile dressing . medications on discharge : 1. tylenol 650 mg po q4h as needed . 2. atenolol 25 mg po per day . 3. benadryl 25-50 mg intravenous qhs as needed . 4. valium 5-10 mg po four times per day as needed . 5. oxycontin 10 mg po three times a day . 6. oxycodone 5-10 mg po q4h as needed pain . 7. senna tablets 2 tablets po

q.day , zestril 10 mg po q.day , lasix 20 mg po q.day . word disability and probably duration : the patient is disabled . history of present illness : ms. kotereef is a 93-year-old woman who was transferred from daleglo medical center with renal insufficiency . the patient was in her usual state of health until 7/10/98 when she was admitted to the daleglo medical center with a chief complaint of falling and mental status changes . she was initially treated for heart failure and pneumonia and , on the night of admission , she experienced a fever to 104 , acute respiratory distress and required intubation for two days . the patient was noted to have a cpk of 150 with 11.8 percent mb but no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes . she was treated for congestive heart failure and was diuresed and extubated . she was transferred to the floor where initially she did very well but subsequently developed an elevated bun and creatinine and failure to eat . the patient 's granddaughter requested that she be transferred to the ph university of medical center where she had been cared for in the past for her myocardial infarction as well as cerebrovascular disease . past medical history : her past medical history is notable for congestive heart failure with a last ejection fraction noted to be 28 percent in april of 1997 . she also has a history of urinary tract infection . she has a history of diverticulosis with lower gi bleeds . in 01/95 she was admitted with a cerebral vascular accident notable for right facial droop and left-sided weakness . there was marked improvement in these symptoms thereafter , and the patient was discharged on coumadin which was subsequently discontinued . the patient also has a history of myocardial infarction in 1977 and 1987 and underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting x4 in 1987 . she also has a history of polymyalgia rheumatica with a bilateral temporal artery being biopsied and being negative for temporal arteritis . she also has a history of right proximal femur fracture and internal fixation in 1995 . on arrival to the ph university of medical center the patient stated that she had not had a bowel movement for many days and that she had no appetite . however , she denied any chest pain , dyspnea or syncope . physical examination : on physical examination her pulse was 55 . her systolic blood pressure was 110 . she appeared to be very dry with very dry mucosa . her lungs had few rhonchi , no rales . her cardiac exam was irregular but her heart sounds were distant . her abdomen showed active bowel sounds , was nontender and she had no pedal edema . laboratory data : laboratory data was notable for hematocrit of 33.5 , white count of 14.7 , platelet count of 270 . bun 112 , creatinine 2.3 , sodium 142 , potassium 4.2 , co2 23.4 , and chloride 104 . a chest x-ray revealed clear lungs on a portable chest x-ray without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema . a kub showed a large loop of dilated bowel but no free air and a tortuous calcified aorta . an electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of an old inferior myocardial infarction and right bundle branch block . hospital course and treatment : the patient was admitted to goman 25 where she was hydrated for the presumed diagnosis of pre-renal azotemia . a urinalysis was notable for pyuria with 50 to 100 white cells , and the patient was begun on levofloxacin for presumed polymicrobial urinary tract infection . a head ct scan was performed which showed multiple old ischemic infarcts in the right frontal and cerebellar lobes . there was diffuse atrophy and no evidence of recent bleed . the patient was evaluated by the rheumatology service who noted that the patient 's diagnosis was most consistent with rheumatoid arthritis and possibly pmr . the patient had been followed by dr. friednantflirt of the ph university of medical center . at that time she was noted to have undergone bilateral temporal artery biopsies , both of which were negative for temporal arteritis . the recommendation from the rheumatology service was to attempt to decrease her prednisone to 5 mg po q.day with an eye on a change in the severity of her shoulder arthritis symptoms . on the third hospital day the patient developed a sudden change in her mental status while taking pills . she was noted to be arousable and responsive and minimally conversation . however , she was unable to move her right arm or leg . her eyes were deviated to the left and she had a right facial droop . the patient was taken to the emergent cat scan which revealed no acute bleeding and was felt to be a cerebral vascular occlusion . the patient was evaluated by the stroke service , which recommended a lumbar puncture which was performed and did not reveal evidence of meningitis . a cardiac ultrasound was performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 50 percent with wall motion abnormalities in the inferior septal and inferior walls involving the apex . there was trace mitral regurgitation . multiple aortic valve leaflets were thickened without stenosis . there was no evidence of an intraventricular thrombus . the patient was initially treated by increasing her aspirin from 81 mg to 325 mg . she was also continued to be hydrated . her blood pressure medications were held to allow increased cerebral perfusion . after careful discussion with the neurology service , it was felt that the patient was at too great a risk to be started and maintained on anticoagulant therapy and therefore she was treated conservatively . the patient was subsequently evaluated by the speech pathology service , the physical therapy service and the occupational therapy service for evaluation for her recovery from her stroke . her bun and creatinine continued to decrease with hydration and zestril was re-initiated and , as her blood pressure allowed , her isordil was re-initiated and then her zestril was increased to 10 mg po q.day . digoxin was discontinued because of her improved left ventricular ejection fraction . the patient did have a steady decrease in her hematocrit to a minimum of 26.2 and received one unit of packed red blood cells with restoration of her hematocrit over 30 . her ferritin was 83 and there was no evidence of guaiac positive stools . it was elected to defer further evaluation of her anemia at this time . however , if she became more evidently guaiac positive it would be appropriate to evaluate the source of bleeding in her colon and potentially in her esophagus and stomach . nevertheless , the patient was switched from aspirin to plavix 75 mg po q.day in view of her history of lower gi bleeding . major consideration toward the end of the patient 's hospitalization was whether or not she would be able to take adequate po intake to maintain her volume status . initially it was felt that the patient would require gastroscopy . however , with the assistance of the patient 's granddaughter , the patient was able to increase her po intake with a lot of assistance . the patient 's granddaughter felt that it was likely that her po intake would improve when she returned home to the nursing home . i discussed this with the granddaughter and told her that if her po intake was inadequate , that gastrostomy tube would be reasonable in the future and that we would be available to assist in this as it became necessary . the patient was evaluated by the gi service who thought that a peg would be quite feasible and that they would be delighted to do this if it was necessary and the patient and family agreed . nevertheless , we have decided to postpone this issue for now and to see how she does when she returns to the nursing home . the patient will be transferred tomorrow to naplesvillechaelty . i will get in touch with dr. areas and please do not hesitate to contact me if i can provide any additional information . my direct pager is 935-131-3314 .

february 10 , 1994 , flexible bronchoscopy , flexible esophagoscopy , rigid bronchoscopy , transhiatal esophagectomy ( partial ) , substernal gastric interposition and jejunostomy . multiple bronchoscopies , chest tube insertion . history of present illness : the patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula . the patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 . she did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe . this may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present . bronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable . she underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in march through may of 1993 . she had been doing reasonably well until december of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids . a bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe . she has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then . a barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina . past medical history : bronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident . past surgical history : the patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy , bladder suspension and a tumor removal from the right neck . medications on admission : cefuroxime 1.5 grams intravenously q8h , solu-medrol 62.5 mg intravenously q8h , ventolin metered dose inhaler ,

nondistended . extremities : no clubbing , cyanosis or edema . the rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool . hospital course : the patient was admitted on february 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian . the patient was brought to the operating room on february 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy . findings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus . esophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea . her steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the operating room on february 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy . she then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy . the pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration . she remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the respiratory intensive care unit . the patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included vancomycin , ceftazidime and gentamicin . on postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing . the patient was seen in consultation by the neurology service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking . an endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis . she received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet . the patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator . a repeat echocardiogram on february 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on february 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion . a pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on february 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess . she remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics . her chest x-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome . she suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity . her steroids were weaned . because of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on february 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed . she remained in a coma . the blood cultures on february 26 , 1994 grew out staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia . her sputum grew out pseudomonas aeruginosa as well . the urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin . on march 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections . there was a large left pleural effusion however . this was drained with a left chest tube . her sputum then grew out klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem . she developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed . on march 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness . she was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands . on march 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed . attempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and fentanyl . this was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean . she continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's . she also fell into a coma once again . on march 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes . on april 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation . discussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery . she had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of jose pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones . decision was made in conjunction with the family and dr. caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support . the patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a t-piece in her trachea

resistant staphylococcus aureus pneumonia . principal procedure : wound debridement and split thickness skin grafting on august 17 , 1998 . associated procedures : tracheostomy and gastrostomy placement , endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography . history of present illness : ms. abreun is a fifty nine-year-old white female who was recently diagnosed on may 1998 with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , hypothyroidism and iron deficiency anemia . in late may of 1998 , she fell in the bath tub and had a small avulsion fracture of the left elbow . one month later she presented to an outside hospital complaining of pain in her right hip . a ct scan performed there demonstrated gas in the subcutaneous soft tissues . she was begun on cefazolin and flagyl . a surgical consultation was obtained and she was taken to the operating room for a wide debridement of the right hip distally through the right knee on the lateral and anterior aspects of the right thigh . on july 13 , 1998 , she was transferred from his outside hospital post debridement to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital for further care and management of her wound . past medical history : 1. non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , diagnosed in may 1998 . 2. hypothyroidism , diagnosed twenty five years ago , but untreated for the past several years . 3. iron deficiency anemia . 4. candidiasis of the groin , tinea pedis . 5. diagnosis of nodular density on chest x-ray . past surgical history : hemorrhoidectomy . wound debridement , as above . allergies : no known drug allergies . medications on admission : synthroid 0.125 milligrams po q day . diabeta 7.5 milligrams po q day . iron sulfate 325 milligrams po t.i.d. unasyn 3 grams intravenously q 6 hours . insulin ss . multivitamins . folate . colace 100 milligrams po b.i.d. tylenol # 3 with codeine 1 to 2 po q 6 whenever necessary . physical examination : the patient was sedated and intubated on admission . at presentation demonstrated a woman was hypothermic to 96.1 degrees farenheit . she was intubated on a pressure support of 10 , peep of 5 and rate of 6 with an fio2 of 0.4 . she was in sinus rhythm at 95 beats per minute . head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination remarkable only for evidence malnutrition and temporal wasting . pulmonary , lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally . cardiac ; regular s1 , s2 , no murmurs , gallops or rubs . abdomen edema and anasarca is present up to the level of the umbilicus . abdomen is non-tender , bowel sounds are normal active , no masses are palpable . lower extremity , venous stasis changes are present bilaterally . there is a deep cavity status post debridement of her right lateral lower extremity extending from the greater trochanter to the knee . the wound is packed with wet to dry sterile guaze . the tissue appears healthy and bleeds easily . laboratory : bun 22 , creatinine 0.5 , total protein 3.7 , albumin 0.9 , bilirubin direct 0.4 , total 0.9 , alkaline phosphatase 158 , amylase 20 , arterial blood gases demonstrates a ph of 7.54 , pco2 of 30 , o2 128 , fio2 0.4 . white blood count 20 , hematocrit 29.2 , platelet count 279,000 , prothrombin time 15 , partial thromboplastin time 31.4 . outside chest x-ray dated july 2 , 1998 demonstrates multiple tiny dense nodules in the lateral and superior left lung with scattered nodules in the right upper lung . these nodules are confirmed by chest ct and demonstrated to be smaller than 3 millimeter peripheral nodules appearing in both lung apices . the ct also demonstrated questionable right hepatic hemangioma and multiple tubular hypodensities were hepatic veins should be . hospital course and treatment : because of the extensiveness of ms. abreun 's hospital course it will be organized by system : 1. neurological : on admission the patient was intubated and sedated . her sedation was gradually weaned during her first month in the intensive care unit and she was noted to have an underlying depression and history of obsessive compulsive disorder as listed from the patient and her family . a psychiatric evaluation was obtained and she was placed on paxil at 5 milligrams which was gradually increased to a total of 20 milligrams po q day at the time of her admission . on august 29th , ms. abreun again required sedation when she found apneic and hypotensive . she spent several days in the intensive care unit at that time , during which her sedation was gradually weaned back to off . 2. pulmonary : ms. abreun was admitted , sedated and on a respirator , requiring minimal settings with a pressure support of 10 and a pep of 5 . after two weeks of intubation on july 25th the patient went to the operating room for a tracheostomy which she tolerated without issue . over the next several weeks , the ventilatory support was gradually weaned to off . by august 9th she was tolerating trach mask trials and was on the verge of tracheostomy removal by august 29th . at this time , she had a sudden episode of respiratory distress accompanied by hypotension and unresponsiveness . she was bag masked and taken immediately to the intensive care unit where she was placed on respiratory support with simv settings which were gradually weaned over the course of her ten days in the intensive care unit . after her wean from the respiratory , she was transferred back to the floor and over the next several days tolerated trach mask trials admirably and had her tracheostomy removed on september 16th , 1998 . at the time of her discharge , she had no acute respiratory issues . 3. cardiovascular : ms. abreun was admitted on cardiac support requiring 30 of neo-synephrine . she was placed on a swan gans catheter monitor and gradually weaned off the neo-synephrine by the 22nd of july . she required no further support and had no further issues until august 29th when she had her respiratory crisis and was transferred to the unit . at this time her dramatic pressure drop required dopamine support at levels of 500 micrograms per minute . a swan gans catheter floated at this time demonstrated an svr of 500 . she was supported with dopamine and with fluid and was slow to come off the dopamine requiring approximately 8 to 10 days for full weaning . after the wean she required no further cardiac medication and had no further issues . 4. renal : ms. abreun 's fluid management was an important contributor to her hospital course . she presented with massive ascites and anasarca for which she received large volume diuresis with regular lasix dosing daily . renal parameters were normal until the time of her respiratory cardiovascular crisis on august 29th . at this time , it was noted that her bun jumped to levels of approximately 80 , while her creatinine stayed at levels of .6 to .7 . an elevation by dr. freiermthalskush of renal medicine at first suspected a subclinical congestive heart failure as being responsible for a prerenal azotemia , however on further elucidation of the patient 's course , it is evident that a broad sepsis caused by her pneumonia was responsible for her decreased svr and eventual renal hypoperfusion . her azotemia responded readily to pressor support and fluid resuscitation . at the end of her second intensive care unit admission , her bun and creatinine had resolved to normal values . 5. gastrointestinal : ms. abreun was admitted nothing by mouth , intubated on intravenous fluids alone . she was immediately begun on total parenteral nutrition therapy for what would be a prolonged course without po intake . on july 25th a g tube was placed and feeds were begun gradually . these g tube feeds were gradually increased with a total parenteral nutrition wean , however at the time of her re-admission to the intensive care unit on august 29th aspiration was suspected and all tube feeds were held . she was maintained on total parenteral nutrition for the course of her time in the intensive care unit . at the end of this time , she was begun gradually on g tube feeding , however she was able to tolerate only very small volumes and produce large aspirates . this problem had remained and been ongoing for the remainder of her hospital at fairm of ijordcompmac hospital . she is currently being supported on tube feeds of vivonex at a rate of approximately 20 and hour with aspirates being measured q 4 hours and measuring from 30 to 250 regularly . she has also been supplemented with glutamine 10 grams b.i.d. via the g tube in hopes of reviving what most certainly be her gut atrophy from prolonged disuse . ms. abreun , from the onset of her stay at fairm of ijordcompmac hospital demonstrated elevated alkaline phosphatase levels in isolation from her other liver function tests . these values ranging as high as 2300 were evaluated by gastrointestinal consult who came and performed and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which demonstrated a normal biliary system with diameters on the large end of normal . stone was demonstrated in the gallbladder , but there was no evidence of obstruction and the study was ready as normal . 5 'nucleotidase values have also been elevated ranging from 150 to 180 . to date there has been no satisfactory explanation for these elevations in alkaline phosphatase and 5 'nucleotidase and all associated studies have been negative . further evaluation of this during her later hospital stay or as an outpatient . 6. infectious disease : ms. abreun underwent a work up for tuberculosis at the beginning of her hospital course . she ruled out by ppd . the initial management of her necrotizing fascitis was empiric with imipenem , flagyl and vancomycin . because of the extent of her wound , she was also treated with hyperbaric oxygen which was of some benefit in resolving her infection . the course of flagyl , imipenem and vancomycin was continued for fourteen days . at this time imipenem were discontinued and vancomycin was maintained alone for additional several days . she then went without antibiotic therapy for a period of several weeks until her crisis of august 29th . on admission to the unit , she was begun on triple antibiotic therapy with levo / vanc/flagyl . shortly thereafter gentamicin was added to the regimen which was maintained for a period of one week until cultures came back and her therapy could be stream lined to vancomycin , levofloxacin alone . after a ten day course of levofloxacin it was discontinued , vancomycin was maintained for five additional days , after which time , it was discontinued as well and she was without antibiotics . on discharge , she was currently taking no antibiotics . ms. abreun entered the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital having taking only oral hypoglycemic agents for control of her diabetes . because of the stress of her infection and intensive care unit admission she was requiring sliding scale insulin for the full course of her hospital stay . her total parenteral nutrition was also supplemented with insulin nph for better control . her total parenteral nutrition is currently supplemented with 30 units nph q day and she is on a sliding scale to control the remainder of her sugars . ms. abreun 's hypothyroidism diagnosed shortly before her admission was an important aspect of her therapy during her course at fairm of ijordcompmac hospital . her thyroid necessity was poorly controlled with a synthroid dose of 0.125 milligrams for the majority of her stay . at the time of her admission to the intensive care unit on august 29th it was noted that she had a thyroid stimulating hormone that was dramatically raised to a value of 26.83 . more active supplementation was performed increasing her dose to .3 milligrams q day , which caused a rapid resolution of her thyroid studies and an improvement in her physiology almost immediately . she has since been maintained on a dose of 0.2 milligrams iv q d . however , she has had a gradual rise in her thyroid stimulating hormone to a value of 6.68 . her discharge medication will include synthroid dose of 0.3 milligrams po q day with recommendation that this parameter be followed closely . in summary : ms. abreun is a fifty nine-year-old female who presented with necrotizing fascitis of the right hip , status post debridement , severely debilitated by the extent of her infection . over the course of 2 months this infection was cleared , the wound was cleaned and split thickness skin grafting was successful in covering over the wound . her course , however was complicated by an methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was resistant to therapy and which produced a profound sepsis which caused a hypotensive ana apneic episode which required intensive care unit support for a period of a week . her course was also complicated by her hypoactive thyroid function which went unrecognized for some period , but has since resolved with aggressive synthroid therapy . currently , her most issues are the advancement of her tube feeds and the restarting of her po intake which was planned to begin for the next several days before her transfer was initiated . her wound also requires further care as smaller areas of non-take in the graft are being management with sterile saline wet to dry dressings . condition on discharge : stable with issues resolving . medications on discharge : heparin 5,000 units sub q b.i.d. prilosec 20 milligrams per g tube q day . paxil 10 milligrams per g tube q.h.s. milk of magnesia 30 ccs per g tube q.h.s. lotrimin cream b.i.d. to effected areas . nystatin powder b.i.d. to effected areas . lasix 20 milligrams intravenous q day . synthroid 0.3 milligrams per g tube q day . reglan 10 milligrams per g tube t.i.d. peri-colace 15 ccs per g tube q.h.s. glutamine 10 grams diluted as necessary per g tube t.i.d. ativan 0.5 milligrams to 1 milligrams per g tube or sublingual q 6 hours whenever necessary . insulin sliding scale as follows ; 0 to 70 call house officer , 70 to 200 no insulin , 201 to 250 2 units of insulin , 251 to 300 4 units of insulin , 301 to 350 6 units of insulin , 351 to 400 8 units of insulin , 401 or above 10 units of insulin and call house officer . the patient is also receiving total parenteral nutrition as designed by the nutritional services at fairm of ijordcompmac hospital . instructions : dressing changes with sterile saline wet to dry guaze bandages on areas of breakdown on the graft . the patient is currently nothing by mouth and will require a modified barium swallow before beginning po feeds . physical therapy and occupational therapy to work with patient daily in improving activity and working toward ambulation . disposition : follow up with primary care physician dr. vontha elkszuk , phone number ( 644 ) 075-7150 . sta bodejove , m.d. dictating for : rey caffefalmyoretland , m.d. tr : ug dd :

x-ray revealed a small right lower lobe infiltrate , on the 14th , with a tiny effusion on the 20th , the night of admission . the pneumonia was now noted to be much larger , with a new right middle lobe infiltrate , as well as with a diffuse reticular interstitial pattern noted at the fringes of the pneumonic infiltrate . sputums were sent off for gram stain and culture , as well as for afb smear cultures . his electrocardiogram was within normal limits . his urine sediment was basically within normal limits . hospital course : mr. cliffestreukote was admitted on the night of the 20th , for obvious right lung pneumonia . the differential diagnosis included several organisms as outlined below . (1) pneumonia . he was admitted for a pneumonia unresponsive to antibiotics for five days . the pneumonia was found to be multilobar , and accompanied by significant hypoxia . he was started on broad spectrum coverage , including ceftriaxone , clindamycin , and ciprofloxacin . the ration off for the utilization of the ciprofloxacin , was that because of his allergy to erythromycin , an alternative regimen was needed to cover for legionella , which was probably the leading diagnosis at the time of admission , because of his hyponatremia accompanied by liver function abnormalities . however , he was isolated , and three afb smears were obtained , in order to rule out tuberculosis . in addition , sputum induction was performed for pneumocystis , which was negative . his urinary legionella antigen subsequently came back negative . however , this test is only 85-95% sensitive for legionella pneumophila , type i , which is the subtype that causes some 80% of legionnaires disease . however , the legionella antigen is neither sensitive , nor specific , for other legionella species that may be involved in legionella pneumonia . therefore , the ciprofloxacin was continued . in addition , his sputum cultures were all negative , as of the day of admission . after admission , with the initiation of antibiotic therapy , mr. cliffestreukote remained quite hypoxic . however , within one to two days after admission , he defervesced with a significant decrease in his cough during the week , post admission . because of persistent hypoxemia on room air , as well as nasal cannula , some concern was raised about the possibility of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , versus some other lesion that may predispose him for persistent hypoxemia , ( i.e. malignancy ) . therefore , an evaluation by the pulmonary team of the tonwe hospital , as well as a sputum cytology and chest ct scan , were all obtained . the chest ct scan revealed evidence for emphysematous changes of his lungs , as well as the previously noted right pneumonia , with several pseudo abscesses noted in infected bullae . his sputum cytology is pending at the time of discharge . the pulmonary team felt that the patient exhibited significant physical findings , laboratory values , and radiologic features , all consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . therefore , his persistent hypoxemia may be secondary to that underlying disease . despite being afebrile , with significant decrease in his cough , mr. cliffestreukote will be maintained , after discharge , on eleven more days of antibiotic therapy , to complete a full course . it should be noted , that clindamycin was discontinued , approximately three days after admission , because of the development of diarrhea . additionally , when switched to oral medication , mr. cliffestreukote was switched to augmentin 500 mg. p.o. t.i.d. , as well as continuing on his ciprofloxacin 150 mg. p.o. b.i.d. (2) hypertension . while in the hospital , mr. cliffestreukote was maintained on hydrochlorothiazide , and verapamil sr , and required no additional medication .

principal diagnosis : (1) stage iiic ovarian carcinoma . secondary diagnoses : (1) right lower lobe pneumonia . (2) failure to thrive ; (3) obstructive uropathy . identifying data and chief complaint : mrs. saujule t. neathe is a 73 year old gravida 6 para 4 abortions 2 with a background history of stage iiic papillary serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary who presents on 5/30/94 for failure to thrive , right lower lobe pneumonia and obstructive uropathy . history of present illness : the patient was diagnosed with ovarian carcinoma in the summer of 1992 when she presented with abdominal distention . at that time she was taken to the operating room and an ileostomy and colectomy performed . the admission was complicated by the development of a right calf deep venous thrombosis on postoperative day four . the patient was referred then to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital where she underwent thrombectomy . one month later the patient was readmitted to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital for definitive debulking including total abdominal hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy , omentectomy , splenectomy and ileostomy take-down by dr. slaineaee chabechird . thereafter she underwent line 1 chemotherapy with cis platinum , vp16 which she received six cycles and which was completed in march of 1993 . this course of chemotherapy was complicated only by persistent diarrhea and some nausea and vomiting . on 4/28/94 the patient developed a left femoral deep venous thrombosis requiring admission for anticoagulation . an abdominopelvic computerized tomography scan during that admission showed recurrent disease in the pelvis with bilateral hydronephrosis . bilateral ureteric stents were placed prior to discharge . two days following discharge , however , the patient was admitted to sephsandpot center because of a decreased urinary output and persistent nausea and vomiting and anorexia . she was maintained on intravenous fluids and received a transfusion of prilosec which helped her urinary obstruction . on this regimen she showed good improvement and was discharge home . she was then seen on 5/30/94 at fairm of ijordcompmac hospital for a routine chemotherapy but complained of decreased urinary output , nausea and vomiting and poor appetite and was therefore admitted . past medical history : is as detailed above . past surgical history : she is also status post appendectomy in 1944 and dilation and curettage in 1945 . allergies : she is allergic to shellfish . drug allergies : she has no known drug allergies . medications on admission : include coumadin 2.5 mg. p.o. q.h.s. , omeprazole 20 mg. p.o. q.d. , m.v.i. one tablet p.o. q.d. , ferrous sulfate 325 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , ativan .5 mg. p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. for sleep and tylenol no. 3 one to two tablets p.o. 4 hourly for pain . physical examination : ( on admission ) showed the patient to be low-grade febrile with temperature of 99.6 , vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 104/68 and a pulse of 92 , respiratory rate 16 . she was noted to be a thin , cachectic woman in no apparent distress . head and neck examination remarkable only for extreme dry mucous membranes consistent with dehydration . she had slightly icteric sclera , no adenopathy or thyromegaly . lungs examination was unremarkable with no focal pathology , breasts were within normal limits . heart : regular rate and rhythm , no evidence of evidence , cardiac failure or endocarditis . abdomen : showed well healed midline scar , non-distended , non-tender , bowel sounds were good , multiple small nodules were palpated subcutaneously in the upper abdomen which was non-tender , there was no costovertebral angle tenderness . pelvic and rectal examinations confirmed recurrence of tumor mass in the pelvis . the patient was occult blood negative . extremities : showed no evidence of acute deep venous thrombosis . however , left leg had two plus pitting edema to the knee whereas the right leg had minimal edema . laboratory data : ( on admission ) showed sodium 119 , potassium 9.8 ( the specimen was hemolyzed ) bun and creatinine of 26 and 2.3 respectively , glucose 104 , alt was 13 , total bilirubin .5 , alkaline phosphatase 62 , white blood cell count was 17.7 , hematocrit 26.7 , platelet count 223,000 , prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were 22.1 and 37 respectively . i and r was 5.2. urinalysis showed no white blood cells and few bacteria . chest x-ray from 5/18/94 was within normal limits . in summary : the patient was assessed as a 72 year old woman with a background of stage iiic ovarian carcinoma and documented local recurrence who presents for line 2 of cycle 1 chemotherapy with adriamycin , ifex and mesna . she also has a low-grade fever of unknown etiology , has a background history of deep venous thrombosis and is therefore currently on anticoagulation and she shows evidence of dehydration and failure to thrive . it was decided at that time to hold off with the chemotherapy . hospital course : the patient was therefore admitted to the gyn / oncology service under the care of dr. chabechird . laboratory tests were repeated in view of some of the above abnormalities and was remarkable for sodium 138 , potassium 4.0 , bun and creatinine remained elevated at 36 and 2.8 respectively . urinalysis showed 10-20 white blood cells . in view of the nausea and vomiting a nasogastric tube was placed to which the patient some relief . repeat chest x-ray showed evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia . renal ultrasound was performed which showed moderate right and severe left hydronephrosis , bilateral ureteric stents were visualized . dr. ryna r. jescdrig from the urology service was consulted in view of the above findings . he requested a lasix renal nuclear medicine scan which showed high-grade obstruction of both kidneys , left greater than right and minimal clearance with lasix . neither kidney appeared to be completely obstructed . in view of these results with the elevated white blood count , elevated creatinine , dr. jescdrig felt that the patient was inadequately stented . as a result she was taken back to the operating room on 6/2/94 and under cystoscopy the old stents were removed and new larger stents were placed . the patient was started on ampicillin and gentamicin for urinary tract infection which ultimately grew out escherichia coli sensitive to the above antibiotics and for right lower lobe pneumonia on x-ray . she was started on nebulizers around-the-clock and chest physical therapy . sputum culture was sent but failed to identify an infective organism . on the above regimen the patient showed marked improvement . her urinary output remained good at 80-100 ccs. per hour . however , her bun and creatinine remained elevated . on 6/5/94 they were 21 and 2.2 respectively . her coumadin anticoagulation was adjusted to give a prothrombin time between 16 and 18 and an i and r of 2.5-3 . on june 5 , 1994 it was decided that mrs. neathe was not stable enough with a line 2 cycle i chemotherapy with ifex , adriamycin and mesna . she was therefore well hydrated and was started on her chemotherapy . in view of her kidney damage it was suggested to change her intravenous antibiotics from ancef and gentamicin to ancef and ciprofloxacin which she tolerated well . on 6/7/94 the patient was found to be mildly confused with persistent nausea and malaise . urinary electrolytes were noted to be within normal limits but her confusion persisted . a neuro-oncology consult was sought which felt this was probably secondary to ifex intoxication and her chemotherapy was stopped . an electroencephalogram was requested and was negative . no computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging study of the head was performed . she continued to have persistent nausea and vomiting with large amount of drainage through the nasogastric tube between 1200 and 1500 ccs. for 24 hours . off her ifex the patient 's sensorium slowly cleared but the nausea and vomiting persisted . for this reason a barium study was performed on 6/12/94 which showed a fixed stricture at the anastomosis of the descending colon with the rectum . the mucosa appeared to be preserved . in addition there was some narrowing in the mid portion of the descending colon . the patient 's white blood count which had been followed carefully began to drop precipitously on 6/11/94 and nadired down to 0.7 on 6/12/94 . the patient was placed on neutropenic precautions , her intravenous antibiotics were continued . her sensorium had cleared . because of persistent nausea and vomiting on june 13 , 1994 a kub and upright was requested which showed large amounts of retained barium confirming a rectosigmoid stricture approximately one centimeter in diameter . the patient 's white blood count persisted in the region of .5 to .6 with an anc of 60 for the next two to three days . in addition her platelets began to drop and reach a level on 6/13/94 . she was maintained on intravenous antibiotics and gcsf therapy was started because of the profound neutropenia . despite the low platelets the patient showed no evidence of active bleeding and was not transfused . a gastrograffin upper gastrointestinal was attempted on 6/14/94 but was unsuccessful due to nausea and vomiting . on conservative therapy the patient 's nausea and vomiting has slowly subsided . a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( peg ) tube was placed on june 18 , 1994 which has helped to decompress the stomach and prevent nausea and vomiting . on 6/17/94 in view of a drop in hematocrit to 25 , the patient was transfused three units of packed red blood cells , white count however had increased to 8.5 and her platelets were on their way up , count was 74,000 . and she was not given platelets in addition . throughout this period the patient 's pain remained well controlled on patient controlled analgesia . after much discussion with the family and social services it was decided to transfer the patient home once stable . on august 21 , 1994 a picc line was placed to facilitate home patient controlled analgesia ( pca ) and on 6/23/94 this was found to be correctly positioned on chest x-ray . on june 23 , 1994 the patient was found to be mobilizing relatively well with few episodes of nausea and vomiting . the peg tube was found to be draining well . she was discharged home in a stable condition into the care of her family . in addition she will be followed by sephsandpot center and dwardsc center who will arrange for home pca ( patient controlled analgesia ) . the patient 's prognosis is guarded . her current code status is do not resuscitate ( dnr ) . medications on discharge : include omeprazole 20 mg. p.o. q.d. , timoptic eye drops .5 percent one drop ou b.i.d. she will receive intravenous fluids d5 1/2 normal saline plus 20 of potassium at 110 ccs / hour at home and is going to be placed on a subcutaneous morphine pump as arranged by sephsandpot center . the patient may have liquids as tolerated but no solid foods . in addition she will be followed by santea gehawhi general hospital for peg tube care and flushing and to assess her pain control . follow-up : the patient will follow up with dr. chabechird on an out-patient basis . longkend sapshuff , m.d. dictating for : slaineaee s. niet chabechird , m.d. tr : suh / bmot dd :

principal diagnosis : ventricular tachycardia . associated diagnosis : coronary artery disease , hypertension . special procedures and operations : 3-17-94 , implantation of an automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator . other procedures : 3-11-94 , right heart cardiac catheterization with comprehensive electrophysiology study and radio frequency ablation for ventricular tachycardia . doctors discharge orders : zestril 5 mg po q.day , nitropatch .2 mg once daily , sotalol 120 mg po b.i.d. , lasix 20 mg po b.i.d. , coumadin as directed . history of present illness : the patient is a 72 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease . he had experienced three myocardial infarctions since 1988 . he presented with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in december , 1994 and was admitted to tecal galecounxopt community hospital . the coronary angiogram performed during his hospitalization had revealed 95% of left anterior descending artery disease and diffuse left circumflex disease . an echocardiogram had revealed an ejection fraction of 41% with apicalakinesis . he had undergone electrophysiology study and his incessant ventricular tachycardia was interrupted by transcatheter radio frequency ablation . after the ablation procedure , programmed stimulation had initiated another ventricular tachycardia with distinct surface qrs configuration but since there was no spontaneous ventricular tachycardia , the other forms were not pursued vigorously . the patient was discharged while on procainamide and coumadin . on march 8 , he developed palpitations with shortness of breath and chest pain . the patient was admitted to an outside hospital in xingwa moineswest where a wide complex tachycardia with a rate of 160 beats per minute was demonstrated . the tachycardia had not responded to intravenous lidocaine or procainamide but has responded to intravenous verapamil . the patient was transferred to tecal galecounxopt community hospital for further evaluation . past medical history : the past medical history is notable for hypertension , left ventricular aneurysm and deep venous thrombosis which he experienced one month ago after the radio frequency ablation . physical examination : on admission physical examination , he was a well developed , well nourished elderly man in slightly dyspneic and uncomfortable condition . his blood pressure was 130/80 millimeters of mercury , and pulse was 80 beats per minute . the carotids were 2+ on both sides with bruits on each side . the jugular venous pressure was 7 centimeters . lung examination revealed crackling rales over the bases of both lungs . cardiovascular exam : normal sl and s2 . the abdomen was benign . extremities : no clubbing , cyanosis or edema . laboratory data : the chest x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the step down unit . the patient continued to experience multiple episodes of sustained and nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia . intravenous procainamide was started , which reduced the frequency and the duration of the ventricular tachycardia . on march 11 , the patient underwent an electrophysiology study . during the study , ventricular tachycardia with a cycle length of 510 milliseconds was reproducibly induced by extra stimuli delivered from the right ventricular apex . pace mapping studies had demonstrated that the origin of the tachycardia to be in the inferior , lateral and apical left ventricle . after mapping of the tachycardia , radio frequency ablation was carried out with four current applications , terminating the ventricular tachycardia in three of the four times . after radio frequency ablation , no sustained ventricular tachycardias occurred . however , there were periods of supraventricular tachycardias with a rate of 160-180 beats per minute and the patient was placed on sotalol . since the patient was known to have multiple different ventricular tachycardias , automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy was also offered to the patient . the patient agreed to proceed with automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy . on march 17 , the patient was taken to the pacemaker laboratory and a transvenous lead for the automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator ( cpi endotak c 0074 ) was placed . then , the patient was transferred to the operating room and a ventak prx model 1705 automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator system was implanted . the defibrillation threshold was less than or equal to 20 joules on several consecutive attempts . the patient 's postoperative course was uneventful . on march 19 , the patient was taken back to the electrophysiology laboratory where noninvasive programmed stimulation and automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator testing were performed . under brief propafol anesthesia , rapid ventricular tachycardia was induced by ramp pacing . this was properly detected and converted to normal sinus rhythm with a single 34 joule countershock . three zones were programmed in the cardiac defibrillator . for tachycardias with heart rate between 110 and 140 beats per minute , no therapy was programmed . for tachycardias with heart rates between 140 and 175 , anti-tachycardia pacing followed by cardioversion is programmed . for tachycardias faster than 175 beats per minute , cardioversion and defibrillation was programmed . vvi pacing at 40 beats per minute was also programmed . the patient felt good on the morning of march 20 . the patient was discharged home in stable condition on the regimen described above . he will have his prothrombin time checked on monday and will follow up with the defibrillator clinic . ann breuna , m.d. dictating for : iceca back ,

cause of death : multisystem organ failure . sepsis . time of death : 5/19/95 at 3:15 a.m. history of present illness : mr. stone is a 59-year-old gentleman with severe cardiomyopathy , aortic stenosis , alcoholic cirrhosis , and rectal cancer , who was scheduled for a resection of his rectal adenocarcinoma but was found to be in severe congestive heart failure and admitted to the medicine team for improvement of his heart failure . he has a long history of alcohol abuse with cirrhosis and dilated cardiomyopathy , presumably due to alcohol . he has mitral regurgitation , tricuspid regurgitation , and an aortic valve area of 1.1 cm. squared with a peak gradient of 36 to 54 . he has also had atrial fibrillation since 1990 , which has been rate controlled on digoxin . he was recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the colon following an episode of bright red blood per rectum and 3.5-cm. sessile lesion at 27 cm. , which was biopsied through a colonoscopy , which revealed adenocarcinoma . past medical history : alcoholic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20% . adenocarcinoma of the colon . cirrhosis . atrial fibrillation since 1990 . recurrent urinary tract infections . mitral valve regurgitation of 4+ . tricuspid regurgitation . aortic stenosis . cellulitis and sepsis in 1992 . hyponatremia . peripheral vascular disease . admission medications : lasix 40 mg. b.i.d. tagamet 400 mg. b.i.d. lisinopril 10 mg. q. day . digoxin 0.25 mg. q. day . cipro 250 mg. b.i.d. allergies : sulfa medications . physical examination : his temperature was 99 . blood pressure was 104/66 . heart rate was 110 . oxygen saturation was 97% on room air . he had jugular venous distention to the level of the jaw in the upright position . his heart rate was irregularly with a 2/6 holosystolic murmur . his chest revealed bilateral basilar rales to one-halfway up the chest . his abdomen was soft and nontender with a positive fluid wave and a liver edge 3 cm. below the costal margin . hospital course : he was admitted to the medicine service and diuresed with lasix and started on captopril with the lisinopril discontinued . after aggressive diuresis on the medical service , he was deemed stable for surgery . after many discussions between dr. leickgrend , the patient , and his family , concerning the severely high risk , given the patient 's conditions , it was decided to proceed with the operation . on 4/27/95 , he was taken to the operating room where he underwent a sigmoid colectomy under general endotracheal anesthesia . his fluids were very strongly restricted , and he only received 500 cc. of crystalloid in the operating room with 400 cc. of blood loss and 500 cc. of ascites evacuated . he was taken to the post-surgical intensive care unit , intubated and stable . he continued to have rapid atrial fibrillation and had much difficulty weaning from the ventilator . he was finally extubated on 5/10/95 , and despite respiratory rates in the 30s and very coarse , rhonchorous breath sounds , the patient continued to have acceptable oxygen saturation and acceptable blood gases on minimal oxygen . his status , however , remained volatile , and in keeping his volume status somewhat on the dry side to optimize his pulmonary status , he became relatively oliguric and hypernatremic . he required some fluid boluses with d-5-w to improve his renal function , intravascular volume , and electrolyte balance . on 5/14/95 , he returned to the surgical intensive care unit for very aggressive pulmonary toilet . on 5/15/95 , he was taken to the angio suite for an attempted transhepatic internal jugular porta caval shunt . his portal systemic gradient was only 3 mm. , going from 26 to 23 , so no shunt was placed . on 5/17 , he spiked a temperature to 103 with rigors and shaking chills . his respiratory status decompensated acutely , and he required reintubation emergently . at that time , multiple discussions were held with the family , and they decided to enact a do not resuscitate order . mr. stone 's renal function continued to deteriorate as well his liver function with rising bilirubin and increasing creatinine . his urine output remained very low . his white blood cell count rose to 22,000 with a 50% bandemia . a swan-ganz catheter revealed an svr of 350 , and he was started on neo-synephrine and epinephrine prior to the do not resuscitate order . throughout the day on 5/18/95 , his blood pressure continued to fall in the 80s , then 70s , then 60s , and at 3:15 a.m. on 5/19/95 , despite multiple pressors , his blood pressure dropped down to 50 ; he then went into ventricular fibrillation , followed by flat line . at that time , he had no spontaneous respirations and no audible heart tones . he had no carotid pulses , no gag reflex , and no pupillary reflex , and his pupils were fixed and dilated . he was pronounced dead at 3:15 a.m. the family was contacted and were present at his bedside . a postmortem autopsy was requested and denied by the family . dictated by : nila s. kayschird , m.d. ew96 attending : ra leickgrend , m.d. rj12 oy792/4208 batch : 0953 index no. sizyjjshq d : 05/19/95 t : 05/22/95

12. history of gout . 13. mediastinal mass on previous ct scans . principal procedure : 1. cardiac catheterization . 2. echocardiogram . 3. sleep study . 4. chest ct scan . adverse drug reactions : none . clinical infections : none . history of present illness : mr. warm is an 83 year old man with chronic congestive heart failure , mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis who was admitted for diagnostic cardiac catheterization . over the last four to five months , mr. warm has noted a marked decline in functional capacity with nearly daily pnd and orthopnea . he has not experienced recent syncope but did have a syncopal episode in 1 resulting in implantation of a defibrillator . although in the past , he has been somewhat ambivalent with respect to cardiac surgery , given the decline in his functional capacity , he agreed to undergo repeat cardiac catheterization with a view towards defining his candidacy for cardiac surgery . the patient lives independently with his wife in connecticut and continues to be less and less active unfortunately . he has nearly curtailed his trips to a gymnasium for cardiopulmonary exercising . he does not drink alcohol and does not smoke cigarettes . physical examination on admission : on examination , the patient was an extraordinarily pleasant man who appeared his stated age . his blood pressure was 110/70 . heart was 82 and regular . respiratory rate was 16 . his jugular venous pressure was not elevated and his carotids were 2+ . lungs were notable for adequate air movement with no rales . the first and second heart sounds were physiologically split and the cardiac impulse was rather diffuse and inferiorly displaced . there was an s3 gallop at the apex and a 2/6 murmur of mitral regurgitation at the apex which radiated to the axilla . the abdomen was soft and nontender . there was no organomegaly but modest hepatojugular reflex . the extremities were without edema and were warm and well perfused . the posterior tibialis pulses were intact . laboratory data : sodium 140 , potassium 5.0 , bun 45 , creatinine 1.9 , glucose 90 . albumin 3.6 , hematocrit 41 , white count 8.6 , platelets 388 and pt 12.6 seconds . the chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly and no significant congestion . the ecg was paced . an outpatient echocardiogram revealed a left atrium of 45 mms. , an lv of 60 mms. , ejection fraction of 26% , moderate to severe mitral regurgitation by color and spectral doppler , aortic stenosis with a valve area of .8 cms. squared with a peak gradient of 50 , a mean gradient of 30 , an ejection fraction of 26% with diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis and more severe inferior hypokinesis . there was mild tricuspid insufficiency , an estimated rv peak systolic pressure of 55 and a mild diffuse hypokinesis of the right ventricle . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the hospital following uncomplicated cardiac catheterization that revealed a right atrial pressure of 5 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 23 , pulmonary artery pressure of 56/22 with a mean of 36 , a cardiac output of 6.1 liters per minute with a cardiac index of 3.8 liters per minute per meter squared . the aortic valve gradient was approximately 32 mms of mercury peak with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 cms. squared . coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the dominant right coronary artery in the proximal segment with distal reconstitution via left to right collaterals . left ventriculography revealed a dilated , diffusely and severe hypokinetic left ventricle with the anterior basilar wall best perfused and an ejection fraction of 18% . there was 3+ mitral regurgitation and reflux into the pulmonary veins in the ------ views . in addition , there was a 60% lesion in the left circumflex artery and only minimal irregularities in the left anterior descending itself . the patient tolerated the procedure well apart from a small rise in his creatinine to 2.3 which returned to his baseline value of approximately 1.7 to 1.9 at the time of discharge after holding his diuretics and his vasodilator medications . the patient was seen in consultation by dr. win shufffyfe of the cardiac surgery service and after a long discussion with the patient , dr. shufffyfe and the patient 's family , it was decided to defer cardiac surgery likely indefinitely and probably permanently given the patient 's age , co-morbidities , lack of probable benefit with relief of his mitral regurgitation , modest aortic stenosis and relatively modest coronary artery disease . while in hospital , the patient was seen by lenni breutzoln who felt that the incremental benefit from biventricular pacing was likely to be modest . the patient also underwent a sleep study which revealed evidence for fairly advanced and severe obstructive sleep apnea with multiple hypopneas and apneas , mean duration of which was approximately 30 seconds with one episodes of 68 seconds with a desaturation to 71% . the patient was fitted with a cpap apparatus with titration of 8-12 cms. of water as tolerated as an outpatient . in addition , the patient had oxygen therapy given his prominent desaturation at night . at the time of discharge , the patient 's vasodilator regimen had been winnowed appreciably and he was discharged with a goal weight of 125 lbs . he will be followed both by dr. warm closely upon return to his son 's home in connecticut and by gie lung of the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital heart failure partners home care program . discharge orders : 1. prn nitroglycerin 0.3 mgs. qd . 2. zocor

complained of headache across the forehead . on the day of presentation , he was then found by his daughter lying on his bed groaning , being relatively unresponsive and unable to speak . the family reported one episode of vomiting at home . physical examination : the patient was afebrile , heart rate 73 , blood pressure 158/53 , respiratory rate 16-20 , oxygen saturation 97% on three liters . general : the patient was somnolent , breathing comfortably , occasionally coughing . neck was supple with full range of motion . no bruits were heard . chest was clear to auscultation but with poor air entry . heart sounds were regular with one out of six holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border . abdomen was soft , non-tender , bowel sounds present . extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis or edema . neurological examination revealed a patient who was intermittently alert , opening eyes to voice , following simple commands , but without any speech . pupils were 4 mm reactive to 2 mm bilaterally . there was no pupillary defect . dolls eye was negative . there was a possible right gaze preference and the patient did not move his eyes . corneals were present bilaterally . gag was present weakly . face was symmetrical . tongue was midline . the patient was moving the right side spontaneously , but could not hold arm or leg up for any length of time . there was only minimal movement on the left side . on sensory testing , the patient withdrew all extremities to pain . reflexes were 2+ and symmetrical all over . the left toe was upgoing , the right toe was downgoing . laboratory : laboratory data revealed a sodium of 139 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 101 , bicarbonate 28 , bun 11 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 151 . ast was 20 , alt 12 , alkaline

normal axis , first degree atrioventricular block , biphasic t-waves in v1 to v3 without any acute changes . a chest x-ray shows left lower lobe consolidation . the head ct scan revealed a large right occipital infarct without midline shift , but positive mass effect on the temporal horn , on the right ventricle and some effacement of the sulci in the right parietal area . hospital course : the patient was admitted to a telemetry bed and started on heparin . around 4:00 am the next day , an acute decompensation in respiratory status was noted . lung examination at that point showed good air entry , no wheezing , coarse breath sounds throughout . neurologically , the patient was not following commands . eyes were closed . he was moving the right arm and leg spontaneously , though less than before . withdrawal to pain was still present . both plantars were upgoing . a blood gas at this point showed a ph of 7.49 , po2 61 , pco2 of 33 on 100% non-rebreather mask . ekg showed sinus tachycardia . the patient 's temperature was 102 degrees . a repeat cat scan of the head was performed . this showed continued evolution of the right posterior cerebral artery infarction now extending into the right cerebellar hemisphere . there was also a high density adjacent to the right cerebellar infarction suggesting the presence of hemorrhage . at this point , the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit . an mri and mra of the head was arranged to evaluate the extent of his stroke and the posterior circulation . the mri showed infarct of the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally , the right occipital lobe , the right thalamus and bilateral pons . the mra of the intracranial circulation demonstrated gross patency of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally and the basilar arteries . the left vertebral artery was not visualized . there was a dominant right vertebral artery . there was mildly reduced flow in the branches of the right middle cerebral artery compared to the left . there was visualization of flow within both posterior cerebral arteries . clinically , the patient continued to deteriorate . neurosurgery was consulted , however the neurosurgeons felt that there was no surgical option , since even in the case of cerebellar swelling , there would be no improvement from decompensation . the patient was therefore treated conservatively with fluid restriction and blood pressure management . heparin was discontinued because of the risk of intercerebral hemorrhage . the aspiration pneumonia was treated with cefotaxime and metronidazole . the patient 's family was involved and they decided to opt for dnr / dni in view of the poor prognosis . the patient passed away at 6:45 am on june 12 , 1998 . condition on discharge : deceased .

principal procedure : on 2/6/2005 , left heart catheterization . other procedures : on 2/6/2005 , left ventriculography ; on 2/6/2005 , bilateral coronary angiography ; and on 2/6/2005 , bypass graft and internal mammary artery angiography . medications on discharge : lipitor 30 mg p.o. daily , accupril 5 mg p.o. daily , folic acid 1 mg p.o. daily , cardizem cd 120 mg p.o. daily , atenolol 25 mg p.o. daily , asa 325 mg p.o. daily , and plavix 75 mg p.o. daily . history of the present illness : mayta neek is a 69-year-old patient of dr. queszucenove tadl at cochusetts medical center . he presents with increasing chest pain and shortness of breath . he has a long history of coronary artery disease and has a two prior coronary bypass surgeries . his first coronary bypass surgery was on 5/7/1985 by dr. riez . he had lima to the lad and vein graft to the diagonal and then a snake fashion two circumflexes and to the acute marginal branch of the right coronary artery . he presented with angina and had an occluded lad and severe circumflex and right coronary disease . he had normal left ventricular function . he did well , but had recurrent angina by 1999 and cardiac catheterization in march of 2000 showed normal left ventricular function with a native nondominant right coronary artery having a 95% stenosis and the vein graft to this vessel was occluded . the left main was normal . the lad was also occluded . the circumflex was patent , although there was disease of the obtuse marginal branches . the lima to the lad was patent , but there was downstream 70% lesions at the apical portion of the lad . the snake graft was open to the diagonal and to the first obtuse marginal branch , but was occluded to the second portion of this vessel . for this reason , he had a second bypass operation on 5/5/2000 by dr. riez . he had a vein graft to the acute marginal of the right coronary artery in snake fashion to the terminal portion of the right coronary artery . he had a vein graft to the diagonal and obtuse marginal one and a vein graft on the lad bypassing the mid lesion . the lima was left from the first surgery . he did have transient atrial fibrillation after surgery . he had chest pain and an abnormal stress test in 2001 and cardiac catheterization at that time on 8/28/2001 showed that all the grafts were patent , but the runoff to the first diagonal for the vein graft was compromised and he had a 2.5 x 15 mm s660 stent placed at the ostium of the diagonal branch . he did have recurrent episodes of pain and his last stress test on 1/17/2005 showed that he could exercise for 9 minutes and then reached a peak heart rate of 99 on medication and a blood pressure of 150/100 , but he had shortness of breath and a posterolateral defect with some filling . he therefore was referred for cardiac catheterization . past medical history : his past medical history includes hypertension , elevated cholesterol , and a herniated disc . he also has had cataract repairs . family history : he has a strong family history with a father and an uncle having had coronary disease at a young age . social history : his social history is that he lives in lotyvall 1 , quera , minnesota with his wife second . he has four children . he is present in a capefrecam luhthousy . he does not drink and does not smoke . allergies : he is allergic to contrast dye having had hypotension and is premedicated with steroids . physical examination : on exam , he is 5 feet , 9 inches , and 160 pounds . his blood pressure is 130/75 . his pulse is 50 and regular . his neck veins are not distended . his head and neck exam is normal . his lungs are clear . his cardiac exam shows no murmurs or gallops . his abdomen is benign . his peripheral pulses are intact . his neurologic exam was nonfocal . he is fully oriented . laboratory data on admission : includes an electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with right bundle-branch block . hematocrit 43% , potassium 4.3 , and creatinine of 1.0 . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the cardiac cath laboratory . there , the native right coronary artery was occluded and the vein graft to the rv marginal and the right-sided pda was patent . the lad was occluded and the lima to the proximal lad was patent , but there was also a jump graft that went from the mid to the distal segment of the lad and that was also patent . the vein graft to the diagonal and circumflex was also patent and the ostial diagonal stent was also patent . the culprit territory was the distal left-sided pda coming off the circumflex and this had an 85% stenosis . this was a very small vessel and this was a tortuous segment and a long lesion . it was felt that this single lesion given the open distal right territory was not worth stenting and it was felt that he should be managed medically . left ventriculography showed inferior hypokinesis and anterolateral hypokinesis with preserved left ventricular function . he tolerated the procedure well . he was monitored for the day . he ambulated without difficulty . he was discharged home and will be followed closely by his physicians at sko gerb timp valley health and at middso memorial hospital 's . he will remain on beta blockers , ace inhibitors , statins , aspirin and plavix indefinitely . electronically signed iard tibelledie fat , m.d. 02/08/2005 18:08

significant coronary artery disease . he developed acute pulmonary edema on may 27 , 1993 , and was admitted to sonpathcermu jords hospital , and found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation . he denied any angina . he had a gaited cardiac blood pool scan that showed an ejection fraction of 31% . his pulmonary function tests showed fev1 of 2.1 , and he was found to have intermittent obstructive sleep apnea . an echocardiogram showed a dilated left atrium with mitral anular calcification . he was discharged home but readmitted on may 21 with recurrent congestive heart failure . a thallium stress test showed equivocal st segment changes with fixed apical and inferior defects . his coronary risk factors include cigarette smoking , obesity , a family history of coronary disease , and elevated serum cholesterol . he also has a history of atrial fibrillation with sinus pauses during sleep apnea . on june 4 , 1993 , he underwent cardiac catheterization . he was found to have an occluded right coronary artery , 70% distal left main lesion , 80% proximal ramus lesion , and his left ventricular ejection shows preserved function except for akinesis of the inferior wall . his ejection fraction was 50% , a carotid duplex study showed plaqueing but no critical lesions . past medical history : as above . social history : he has a wife pandeprob and lives in ashing . he did smoke up to three pack per day . he has three children . he is retired . physical examination : six foot , 250 pounds . he is a well appearing male , in no distress . his blood pressure was 140/70 , pulse 80 and irregular . his neck veins were not distended . his carotids showed bilateral bruits . his lungs are clear . his cardiac exam shows a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur . his abdomen is obese , but benign . his peripheral pulses are intact . he has no peripheral edema . his neurological exam is nonfocal . laboratory data : sodium 140 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 104 , co2 30 , calcium 9.3 , phosphorous 1.2 , bun 9 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 183 . uric acid 8.4 , bilirubin 0.7 , alkaline phosphatase 72 , amylase 46 , sgot 20 , and his digoxin level was 1.0 . hematocrit 38% , white blood cell count 7700 , mcv 86 , pt and ptt were normal . urinalysis was unremarkable . his chest x-ray was normal with bilateral pleural thickening . his electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation . there were nonspecific st and t wave changes . hospital course : the patient was admitted to hellworthston hospital . there , he stabilized , and was seen in consultation by cardiology and anesthesiology . there was concern over his sleep apnea , but he appeared to have primarily cardiac disease and therefore because of the left main stenosis , it was reasonable to proceed . on june 24 , 1993 , dr. lenni breutzoln performed triple coronary bypass surgery . he placed a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , single saphenous vein to the posterior descending artery with 170 cc. per minute flow and a single saphenous vein to the circumflex with 140 cc. per minute flow . he weaned easily off cardiopulmonary bypass . he had no hemodynamic difficulties . he was able to wean from the ventilator , but he did have marginal oxygenation throughout . he did revert back to atrial fibrillation . he was extubated within forty eight hours . he was transferred out of the surgical intensive care unit on june 26 . he reverted back to atrial fibrillation that required digoxin , and verapamil to control . he could not be converted back to normal sinus rhythm even with a trial of quinaglute . he also had anemia and he was seen in consultation by the nutrition service . he was advised to have an ideal body weight of 178 pounds , and clearly a 2300 calorie diet was appropriate for him . weight reduction would be important in the long term management of his coronary disease . he was treated with digoxin and diuretics along with ace inhibitors because of his depressed left ventricular function . he was able to ambulate although somewhat slowly because of his rapid atrial fibrillation . it was considered to obtain a pulmonary consultation on a formal basis , but it was then felt that he would do better by healing fully from his surgery , because he really had little in the way of pulmonary complications , despite the history of sleep apnea of an obstructive basis . primary in his long term management is cardiac rehabilitation with weight reduction . he will be followed closely in 23 hwy , hamp by dr. laymie aslinke . may a , m.d. tr : ot / bmot dd : 7/1/93 td : 07/02/93 cc

principal diagnosis : esophageal carcinoma-metastatic . associated diagnosis : lymphangetic pulmonary carcinomatosis , dyspnea . principal procedure : bronchoscopy , 3/23/95 . history of present illness : mr. po is a 53 year-old white male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus who is admitted with a 10-day history of progressive dyspnea on exertion . briefly , mr. po presented in 1992 with dysphagia and a midesophageal mass that proved to be squamous cell carcinoma . he received two cycles of neoadjuvant cisplatin and 5-fu , followed by esophagectomy , followed by two cycles of adjuvant platinum/5-fu . he was without evidence of disease until the may of 1994 , when he developed an inferior vena cava thrombosis and ct scan revealed celiac axis adenopathy . by october of 1994 , pulmonary disease , consistent with lymphangetic spread of tumor , was present . he began ifosfamide chemotherapy but in the last few cycles has had progressive disease . over the last 10 days , he has been bothered by progressive dyspnea on exertion . he has seen two local physicians , who have tried him first on bactrim and subsequently clarithromycin without improvement . he denies fevers , chills , hemoptysis , chest pain , nausea and vomiting , or diarrhea . past medical history : 1) remarkable for a history of ulcers . 2) inferior vena cava occlusion . 3) arthritis . medications on admission : atrovent , proventil , azmacort , serevent inhalers . coumadin , tagamet , and clarithromycin . physical examination : on admission , the patient is afebrile , tachypneic , and tachycardic . skin is pale . the head , eyes , ears , nose , throat exam reveals mild proptosis . he has total alopecia . his neck is supple . there is no thyroid , cervical , or supraclavicular adenopathy . his lungs reveal diffuse wheezes , especially in the left chest . there is minimal air movement on the left lower lobe . the rest of his physical examination was unremarkable . laboratory data : laboratory studies on admission included a bun and creatinine of 14 and 1.4 , normal calcium , white count of 12,100 , hematocrit of 32 , platelet count of 319,000 . pt was 19.8 seconds . his three liter nasal prong blood gas revealed a po2 of 63 , pco2 of 47 , ph of 7.39 . a chest x-ray revealed diffuse air space disease , particularly on the left . hospital course : the patient was admitted with a diagnostic impression of probable progressive carcinoma with a potential component of bronchospasm . however , there was the possibility that this represented an atypical pulmonary infection . hence , he went to bronchoscopy by dr. jesclinke on 4/22/95 . bronchoscopy revealed clear airways without evidence of significant secretions . bal was sent for culture and was negative for pathogenic organisms . a few days after bronchoscopy , his intravenous bactrim was discontinued and he was treated with oxygen , steroids , and inhalers . it was felt that there were no further chemotherapy options for this disease and he met with hospice therapy . in addition , he was hypoxic throughout his admission , often with oxygen saturations in the high 80s despite five liters of supplemental oxygen . this was accompanied with some anxiety , which was treated with intermittent morphine and ativan . the patient was discharged on mar 30 , 1995 with hospice care . his status is dnr . medications on discharge : tagamet , 800 mg. po q.day ; five liters of supplemental oxygen ; carafate , 1 gm. b.i.d. ; ativan , 1 mg. sl q.4 p.r.n. his coumadin was discontinued . in addition , he was sent home on prednisone , 40 mg. q.day . ca n. shuff , m.d. tr : vr / bmot dd : 3/30/95 td : 04/02/95 cc : guabenfranda po , m.d. margmimaui jesclinke , m.d. 
principal diagnosis : left sided spastic hemiparesis , status post surgical correction of c-1 , c-2 dural avm . history of present illness : ms. breunlinke is a 69 year-old right handed woman , status post surgical correction of a c-1 to c-2 dural avm in january , 1998 , now presenting with a one month history of increasing left sided weakness and pain with spasticity , occasional difficulty swallowing and abdominal pain . she was originally admitted to the verg medical center in january , 1998 , because of a one year history of left sided weakness and spasticity . she was found to have intermedullary lesion at c1-2 level which on biopsy showed abnormal vasculature , hemosiderin deposit , leading in turn to the discovery of a dural arteriovenous malformation at that level which was surgically corrected . the postoperative period was complicated by transient swallowing difficulty , increasing left sided weakness and urinary retention . she was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation where she made significant progress toward recovery . as of the beginning of september , 1999 , she was able to swallow without difficulty , urinate without difficulty ( although bowel movements have been problematic ) . functionally , she was at the level of pre-gait training and able to stand and take several steps with upper body support . over the past 4-5 weeks her functional level has progressively deteriorated . she is now unable to stand and needs assistance to sit up . her left arm has developed a flexure contraction and she reports intermitttent pain in the left arm and leg which occurs both spontaneously and is also triggered by contact . she has developed some new swallowing difficulty and since her transfer to a long term inpatient care facility , she has lost ten pounds . she denies dysuria or excessive urinary frequency . over the past several weeks she has also developed severe intermittent abdominal pain , localized to the suprapubic area , left greater than right , occurring intermittently . the patient feels this is secondary to her hemorrhoids , although it does not clearly localize to the rectum . this pain often follows bowel movement but does occur spontaneously . past medical history : significant for insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , atrial fibrillation , hypothyroidism , hypertension , depression , frequent urinary tract infections , neuropathic pain syndrome and osteoporosis . medication : on admission include cozaar 75 mg q.d. , coumadin 2 mg/1 mg alternate days , synthroid 175 mcg q.d. , zoloft 50 mg q.d. , zantac 150 mg

october 23 , 1999 . allergies : the patient is allergic to hydralazine , codeine , ace inhibitors , nifedipine and percocet . physical examination : on admission , heart is regular rate and rhythm without murmur . lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . abdomen is soft , with marked suprapubic tenderness and reduced bowel sounds . anal tone is reduced . rectal examination is nontender and stool is guaiac negative . neurologically , the patient is alert and oriented times three with normal speech , language and repetition . cranial nerves : pupils are 4-6 mm bilaterally , extraocular movements were full without nystagmus . eye closure and smile are symmetric . tongue is midline . facial sensation is sensation . strength : the tone is markedly increased in bot legs with left greater than right . left arm shows a flexor contracture and markedly increased tone . the right arm shows moderate increased tone . power : the left upper extremity shows reduction in motor power ranging from 2/5 in the triceps , 4/5 in the biceps , and 3-4/5 in the wrists and hand intrinsics . the right upper extremity shows generalized reduction in strength , 4/5 in all joints . in the lower extremities on the left hip flexor is 1/5 , knee flexion and extension is 3/5 and 4/5 respectively and plantar and dorsiflexion is 4/5 . the right lower extremity shows a 3/5 on hip flexion , 4/5 at knee flexion and extension and full power on dorsi and plantar flexion . reflexes : upper extremities are very brisk bilaterally and symmetrical 3+. there is positive tremor reflex on the left and absent on the right . lower extremities show patellar reflexes 3+ left , 4+ right , no cross deductor reflexes and absent ankle jerks . there is no clonus on the right but sustained clonus ( 10-12 beats ) on the left . plantar responses : toes are upgoing on the left , down going on the right . sensory : the patient has diminished vibration and propioception in the left upper and lower extremity and decreased temperature , light touch and pinprick sensation in the right upper and lower extremity consistent with a high cervical spinal sensory level . cerebellar ; the patient demonstrates an intention tremor on finger to nose with the left hand . fine motor movements are slow but accurate in the left and right hands . laboratory data : sodium 140 , potassium 3.8 , chloride 100 , bicarbonate of 30 , bun of 13 , creatinine 0.8 , serum glucose 228 . white blood count is 7,000 . hematocrit is 37.6 , platelet count is 148,000 . prothrombin time is 15.9 with an inr of 1.7 . ptt is 24 . urinalysis from october 21 , is positive for citrobacter susceptible to ciprofloxacin , gentamycin , nitrofurantoin , tetracycline and bactrim . electrocardiogram shows no p-waves . the patient is fully paced . hospital course : on admission , a ct scan of the head with and without contrast was performed , showing a missing posterior arch at c-1 and metallic clips at the craniocervical junction consistent with prior surgical intervention . no arteriovenous malformations are identified ; there is no evidence of recurrence of her former vascular malformation . no intraspinal lesions are identified . upon further review of dr. laymie fields , department of neuroradiology , review of the cervical spine on ct reveals no extrinsic compressive lesions impacting the spinal cord and no enhancing lesions of the spinal cord with contrast . angiography performed on october 31 , 1999 , showed normal vascular distribution of the head and neck with no recurrence of arteriovenous malformation . during this admission , the patient was started on baclofen 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. for spasticity . coumadin was discontinued . the patient was given aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. the patient was also given valium 5-10 mg p.o. t.i.d. for muscle spasm . she was continued on demerol 50 mg q 6-8 hours p.r.n. for left arm and leg pain . upon further review of ct and angiography results with neuroradiology and neurology service , it was decided that ct myelography was not indicated at this time . note , the patient is not a candidate for magnetic resonance imaging secondary to ferromagnetic intracardiac pacing device . disposition : the patient was discharged back to raka st , mcape garl , long term facility . we recommend daily physical therapy and occupational therapy to maximize functional capacity with optimization of pharmacological regimen for spasticity including baclofen , valium and adequate analgesia . the patient is to followup in neurology clinic , verg

bid , isordil 20 mg po tid , enteric coated aspirin 1 po qd . history of present illness : the patient is a 65 year old portuguese male with a history of an anterior myocardial infarction i may 1993 and is status post a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the lad who presented on 10-24-93 with crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath . he had no prior cardiac history until may 1993 when on 5-24 he had crushing chest pain which radiated to his left arm . he was found at that time to have 3-4 mm st segment elevations in v1 through v4 at pre health . the patient was transferred to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital and had 4-7 mm st segment elevations across the precordium with q's in v1 and v2 , 2 mm st elevation in avl , and 1-2 mm reciprocal st depression in ii , iii , and f. on physical examination at that time he had bright red blood per rectum and therefore lysis was deferred and he was taken directly to the cardiac catheterization lab . the cardiac catheterization results at that time revealed a right atrial pressure of 7 , pulmonary artery pressure of 29/16 , rv 33/8 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 . he had a 95% proximal left anterior descending lesion which was ptca 'd to a residual of 30% and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed . he also had some mild to moderate disease at the om1 noted at that time . the patient was transferred to the cardiac care unit where he had a peak cpk of 5,042 and 26.7% mb's . his intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned without problems . he had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started . on day six , an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 44% with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis . on day nine , he had a low level exercise tolerance test with thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in ii , iii , and avf , and 1.5 mm downsloping st depressions in v5 and v6 , as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on thallium . therefore , he went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal pda lesion and a circumflex lesion after the om . the patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with dr. shuffburle of gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with dr. amesin of cardiology and dr. shuffpasc of dingclearf alllirefaith memorial hospital . however , he did not keep any of these appointments . he went home and did not take any of his medications and smoked and

medical history included hypertension and non-insulin diabetes mellitus which is diet controlled . past surgical history : his past surgical history had included gastric ulcer surgery and appendectomy . medications on admission : on admission , he was on isordil 10 tid and enteric coated aspirin , but he was not taking either of these medications . habits : the patient smokes one pack per day and has a history of heavy alcohol use . physical examination : the physical examination on admission revealed a blood pressure of 110/70 , a heart rate of 66 , respirations of 24 , temperature of 98 . the heent exam revealed the extra ocular movements intact . the pupils equal , round , reactive to light . the oropharynx was clear and the fundi were normal . there were no hypertensive or diabetic changes . the neck was suppled , with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention . the carotids were 1+ without bruits . the heart was regular rate and rhythm , s4 , s1 , s2 , with a i / vi systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border . the lungs were clear , except for a few dry crackles bibasilarly . the abdomen revealed a midline scar and a right lower quadrant scar , and it was soft and nontender wit positive bowel sounds . the liver edge was 2 cm below the right costal margin , but smooth and nontender . there was no splenomegaly . the femoral pulses were diminished . he had bilateral intertrigo in his femoral region as well as his axillae . the extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema . the pulses were 1+ bilaterally . the skin exam revealed changes consistent with vitiligo . the rectal examination was guaiac negative . laboratory data : the laboratory data revealed normal electrolytes , bun and creatinine , normal liver function tests , a first cpk of 140 , and a hematocrit of 43.1 . the portable chest x-ray showed clear lungs , slight enlarged heart , and a mildly elevated hemidiaphragm . the electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 81 , with normal intervals and normal axis , had poor r-wave progression consistent with an old anterior myocardial infarction , had flipped t-waves in v1 through v5 , which were of no significant change since his last ekg on 5-25-93 . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the step down unit for a rule out mi protocol . he was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin . no beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110/70 . the patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak cpk of 219 and 20.9% mb fraction . this was a non-q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes . on 10-27-93 , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been ptca 'd , a lesion in the first om , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the om3 . the left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle . given the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the ptca , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient . he was ambulated progressively on the floor . a beta blocker was started with metoprolol initially at 25 mg po bid and eventually increased to 50 mg po bid . the patient ambulated extensively on the fih 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath . on 11-2-93 , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with thallium imaging . this treadmill test was done on medications , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment . the patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified bruce protocol , however , he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade . there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm st depression in ii , iii , and avf . the study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain . thallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle . there was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test . these images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous thallium images in may 1993 . after extensive discussion between myself , dr. amesin , and dr. scgach , it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management . the patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although he understands that this may become necessary in the future . dr. amesin had a long discussion with the patient 's daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient 's compliance . previously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments . the importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient . she will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with dr. amesin as well as dr. lfsquarc on the outside . the patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization . despite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done . he will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future .

reason for admission : mr. tennis is a 65-year-old , white male , status post myocardial infarction x two , status post coronary artery bypass graft x three , with an ejection fraction of 20% on transplant workup , who presents with recurrent shortness of breath , chest pain , and light-headedness . history of present illness : the patient has a history of myocardial infarction x two in 1984 and 1987 ( receiving tissue plasminogen activator in 1988 ) and subsequently was admitted to an outside hospital in 1992 with symptoms of congestive heart failure . he was admitted to the utal health in 12/92 for unstable angina and symptoms of congestive heart failure . he was hypotensive and intubated at that time and was subsequently stabilized . cardiac catheterization at that time revealed 50% to 70% left main , 50% to 70% proximal left anterior descending , 70% to 80% mid-left anterior descending , 100% proximal left circumflex , and proximal and distal 50% right coronary artery lesions . an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 25% . he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x three by dr. kennedy with left internal mammary artery toleft anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery , saphenous vein graft to om of the left circumflex . the vein grafts were considered to be very close and of poor quality . in the intervening period , he has had atrial fibrillation as his baseline rhythm which has been treated with procainamide . he has had numerous interval admissions to shoreale medical health for congestive heart failure of an increasing pattern in 03/93 and 08/94 and then every three weeks since the beginning of the year . he has had three-pillow orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and nocturia three to four times

was 100/60 , and pulse was 76 . he took nitroglycerin x one with some relief of his shortness of breath but no change in his other symptoms . the morning of admission , he had another episode with waves of nausea , dizziness , light-headedness , and pallor . he came to the emergency room for evaluation . in the emergency room , he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with a rate of 120 to 150 and with a blood pressure of 124/84 and 98% o2 saturation . he was admitted for diuresis for management of his arrhythmia . past medical history : iron deficiency anemia . hypertension . urosepsis in 1982 . peptic ulcer disease , resulting in gastrectomy . a 65% stenosis of his proximal right internal carotid artery in 12/92 . cataract surgery in his righteye . a 2.5-cm. abdominal aortic aneurysm which was recently sizedat 3.5 cm . allergies : shellfish , which causes nausea and vomiting . social history : smoker for greater than 100 pack years ( 3-1/2 packs per day x 35 years ) . no ethanol

pulse was varying between 120 and 140 . he was afebrile . his respiratory rate was 20 . saturation was 98% in room air . on heent exam , pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light and accommodation . extraocular movements were intact . he had a furrowed tongue , but hisoropharynx was otherwise negative . he had no carotid bruits with good bilateral upstroke . his jvp was difficult to assess with a questionable meniscus near the ear at 45 degrees . cardiac exam revealed an irregular rate . the pmi was anteriorly displaced in the mid clavicular line with an anterior heave . heart sounds were distant and difficult to separate secondary to rate . an s2 split was not appreciated . there were no murmurs . there was no apparent s3 . chest was clear to percussion and auscultation .

incomplete bundle branch block . assessment and plan : in summary , he was found to have strong symptoms of congestive heart failure by history , which were consistent with a chronic picture and low ejection fraction . he was planned for initial medical management with optimization of his cardioactive medications , loading on amiodarone and diuresis . hospital course : he was loaded on amiodarone while under surveillance with cardiac monitor and was aggressively diuresed . a right heart catheterization was performed , and a left heart catheterization was performed , which revealed a right atrial pressure of 10 , a right ventricular pressure of 60/10 , a pulmonary arterial pressure of 40 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 34 , a left ventricular pressure of 115/24 . his left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending was patent ; his saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery was patent ; his saphenous vein graft to om was not detected by the aortic root shot . the ejection fraction was not calculated . a swan-ganz catheter was placed , and his medications were tailored over the course of the following 48 hours by following the appropriate parameters . the swan-ganz catheter was subsequently removed , and his medications were continued to be tuned empirically . during this time , he continued to complain of occasional chest pain which was variably relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin , intravenous metoprolol , and morphine . there were no ekg changes during these episodes . on 3/22 , after an appropriate load of amiodarone , he was successfully

coronary artery disease . history of colon cancer status post hemicolectomy . history of present illness : this is a 76 year old white male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who has had several recent admissions to oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital for respiratory insuffiencey most often secondary to pneumonia . he was most recently discharged from oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital on 03/06/99 and was then transferred to linghs county medical center from which he was discharged on 03/20/99 . the patient was doing relatively at home until one day prior to admission he complained discomfort over a suprapubic catheter area . the patient had missed his usual monthly change of his suprapubic catheter and felt discomfort and noticed some blood at the site of the catheter . the patient was brought to the emergency room one day prior to admission where he was evaluated by urology and had his catheter changed . the patient at that time noted slight shortness of breath but was sent home anyway . on the day of admission the patient noticed increasing shortness of breath . the patient was noted to be confused and to be disoriented toward the end of the day after complaining of shortness of breath for most of the day . the patient denies any recent upper respiratory infections , no fevers , no chills , no change in cough , sputum . he also denies any chest pain . no orthopnea . no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea . the patient had been taking his usual medications and using his nasal oxygen at home . by the time the patient arrived at the oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital emergency room he was in moderate respiratory distress . his initial blood gases on 40% 02 was p02 102 , pc02 115 , ph 7.11 . the patient was given respiratory therapy in the way of nebulizer treatments in the oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital emergency room because of a longstanding desire by patient and family to refrain from intubation to be considered do not resuscitate . the patient was not intubated . however he was transferred to the medical intensive care unit where he received continuous respiratory therapy in theway of albuterol nebulizers as well as nasal oxygen , intravenous steroids and intravenous antibiotics . a chest x-ray in the oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital emergency room showed new changes on his chest x-ray on top of his usual severe bilateral emphysema_____ with scarring in both lungs . there were new air space opacifications in the left apex and the right lower lobe . these were thought to be consistent either with pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema . past medical history : associated medical problems include : 1. atonic bladder with a suprapubic tube . 2. anxiety . 3. coronary artery disease with a history of angina in the distant past . 4. history of colon cancer with a colectomy in the past . medications on admission : 1. ativan 1 mg po twice a day . 2. trusopt 1 gtt left eye three times a day . 3. xalatan 0.005% one gtt left eye qhs . 4. brimonidine 1 gtt left eye three times a day . 5. combivent 3 puffs four times per day . 6. aerobid three puffs twice a day . 7. sorbitol 30 cc every other day . physical examination : he was an elderly frail gentleman in moderate respiratory distress . he had a blood pressure 110/70 , heart rate 110 beats per minute and regular , respiratory rate 25 . he was in moderate respiratory distress . his temperature was 98f . he had a normal head , eyes , ears , nose and throat exam . neck exam revealed no jugular venous distention and no masses . lung exam revealed decreased breath sounds as well as crackles in the bases . there were no wheezes or rhonchi . heart exam revealed a soft s1 and s2 , no murmur was heard , no s3 . abdomen was soft , nontender with no masses palpable . rectal exam was unremarkable with stool heme negative . neurological exam revealed an alert and oriented x 3 elderly male . he moved all extremities . deep tendon reflexes were symmetrical in all extremities . laboratory and radiologic data : sodium 148 , potassium 3.4 , glucose 174 , p02 102 , pc02 115 , ph 7.11 on 40% 02 . blood urea nitrogen 11 , creatinine .6 , uric acid 3.0 , alkaline phosphatase 78 , creatinine phosphokinase isoenzymes too low , hematocrit 41 , white blood cell count 11.6 . urine analysis showed 20-50 white blood cells and 3-5 red blood cells . electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 123 beats per minute compared to previous electrocardiogram of 1/29 there were no significant changes . hospital course : the patient was stabilized in the medical intensive care unit . he stayed in the unit for about one day . during that period of time he received nebulizer treatments with albuterol . he was also started on intravenous ticarcillin for possible gram negative pneumonia . he was diuresed with intravenous lasix to which he responded with at lease a 2l urine output on the first day and 1.5l the second day . after one day in the medical intensive care unit the patient was stable enough to go to the floor where he continued the rest of his treatment . this consisted of continued nebulizer treatments as well as intravenous antibiotics and intravenous solu-medrol . as the patient 's diuresis continued his respiratory status improved . a chest x-ray showed clearing of the opacities in the chest x-ray that were consistent with pulmonary edema because he continued to have some abnormality in the right lower lobe . the patient was continued on antibiotics for possible pneumonia . the antibiotic chosen was levaquin 500 mg 1 tab per day . this was started on 4/2/99 and should be continued for ten days . the ticarcillin was stopped after two days when it was felt that he did not have a serious pneumonia . the patient 's respiratory status continued to improve but towards the last 2-3 days of his hospitalization the amount of improvement was minimal . it was felt that his respiratory status has been maximally treated by then . the patient 's major improvement came after the first two days with brisk diuresis with lasix . while in the oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital the patient on 4/4/99 complained of mild epigastric discomfort because he was put in cimetidine while in the intensive care unit for prophylaxis against peptic ulcer disease . the patient was upgraded to prilosec 20 mg per day for possible treatment of gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease . the patient did have any nausea , vomiting or evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding . the patient 's abdominal pain should be followed over the next week or so in case it does not respond to prilosec . while in oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital the patient was never able to get out of bed and walk independently . it is hoped that when he is transferred to a rehab facility that he will continue with physical therapy to regain his strength and regain independence in activities of daily living . discussion with the family regarding the possibility of sending him to a nursing home was entertained however the family strongly refused to allow him to go a nursing home . they wanted the patient to return to his home after a stay at a rehab facility . condition on discharge : the patient 's respiratory status was stable . i think his breathing was as good as to be expected with the amount of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease he had . he needed to go to a rehab facility for continued respiratory therapy and for physical therapy to increase his muscle strength . medications on discharge : 1. albuterol 2.5 mg in 2.5 normal saline q4h . 2. heparin 5000 units subcutaneously twice a day . 3. ativan .5 mg twice a day . 4. nasal oxygen 3l per minute . 5. levaquin 500 mg per day to be continued until 4/12/99 . 6. lasix

history of present illness : this is a 64 year old patient initially admitted to dr. riode area status post an aorto bifemoral bypass in 01/98 with an end to end proximal and to the common femoral bilaterally . the patient has had recurrent claudication for the last five months and has developed lesions on the first toe which is apparently similar to aparonychia . he had an angiogram which shows a severe stenosis in the right distal area with a thrombosing right limb of an aorto femoral graft . he also has an irregular lesion at the profunda femoris origin and with the superficial femoral occluded bilaterally . he was therefore admitted to the hospital for an ileofemoral bypass . the patient unfortunately continues to smoke and has greater than a 50 pack year history of smoking and by notes of dr. area 's office , this has been discussed at length with him and the implications of the smoking . he has a history of a deep vein thrombosis and a question of a pulmonary embolism with what is thought to be a non fully documented hypercoagulable state . he had a left superficial femoral artery interposition graft around 1990 which is non functioning at the present time , most of which was done at the alconspore woocawo medical center . allergies : the patient has no known drug allergies . medications on admission : his medications on admission include coumadin and levofloxacin . his coumadin has been held for two days . his claudication is equal bilaterally . physical examination : on physical examination was remarkable for no carotid bruits , a ventral hernia without any masses which was reasonably reducible . his rectal exam was refused at the time of surgery since apparently it was negative at the tocon hospital the previous week . he has a first and fourth toe which had some purulent discharge around the toes with ischemic modeled toes and on the left side there were no lesions in the feet . his pulse exam was a femoral pulse bilaterally , but none distally . laboratory data : his bun and creatinine were within normal limits at 16 and 1.3 and his hematocrit was 44 with a white blood count of 10,000 and 139,000 platelet count . he has ankle brachial indices of .36 bilaterally but with his right toes appearing ischemic with lesions he would most likely not heal these lesions . hospital course : dr. area had asked me to see the patient and after discussing with the patient it was agreed that i would proceed with revascularization of his right leg since he had a angiogram which demonstrated a failing limb of his aortofemoral graft and a tight profundus stenosis . after discussing with the patient , getting his prothrombin time closer to range , he was brought to the operating room where a ileo profunda bypass was performed with an 8 mm . ep to fe under general endotracheal anesthesia . there was copious thrombus in the distal right limb of the aortofemoral graft which also had a thromboendarterectomy performed and excellent inflow was achieved . superficial femoral artery was divided since it was also chronically occluded . there was a significant amount of thrombus at the anastomosis as well which had developed a small aneurysmaltype of dilatation , although there was no dehiscence of the anastomosis . the profunda had been opened beyond the origin stenosis and the bypass was then performed providing and excellent flow to the calf and excellent pulsevolume recordings were obtained with strong upstrokes . it was therefore elected not to proceed with a distal bypass graft to the popliteal arteries which would have been required should this not have worked . the patient postoperatively did quite well . he had continued good post volume recordings and there was no question that with this improved circulation and silvadene dressings to his toes that they actually started to heal in his postoperative course with improved perfusion and capillary refill . his groin incision was healing nicely and he was on heparin , being converted to coumadin . because of the issue relating to his hypercoagulable state , and the need for getting him in range , he was keptin the hospital and not discharged . the orders of his wounds and wound care were clarified and he was transferred to frontera 34 to ensure that this would be performed properly . no cellulitis was present , and the patient had indicated his desire to be discharged . despite loading him on coumadin , his prothrombin time and inr increased slowly and he left the hospital without discharge order or discharge planning on the 18th of december . i had called the patient and discussed with him his care , which he had been then transferring to his local medical doctor for anticoagulation purposes . i explained to the patient that because of his early discharge i would not be able to be responsible for his care but would be happy to see him in theoffice for removal of his sutures and an appointment for that was undertaken . degreg r. uph ,

however , family declined aggressive cardiac intervention and opted for medical management only . thus , the patient was admitted to the medical service for gi workup including possibly egd . of note , the patient had a previously scheduled egd for 03/17 . hospital course by system : 1. cardiovascular : ischemia : the patient is status post a non st elevation mi , a troponin peaked at 22 likely secondary to dehydration and presentation of acute renal failure . the patient was managed on a beta blocker . aspirin was held second to his concurrent gi bleed . pump : the patient was initially hydrated on exam ; however , the patient became euvolemic after transfusion of blood and _____ iv fluids . of note , the patient was transfused for a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells during this admission . lasix was given after each unit of packed red blood cells . repeat echo revealed an ef of 45-50% with inferior and posterior basal hypokinesis . overall , the patient had preserved lv function despite a large troponin leak . rate and rhythm : the patient with a history of afib . afib was stable . coumadin and aspirin are held again secondary to his concurrent gi bleed . 2. gi : a gi consult was obtained and the patient had adequate iv access . hematocrit was checked q.8h and the patient was transfused again , as noted above , a total of 4 units packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of less than 30 . the patient was started on protonix iv 40 b.i.d. per gi consult given the patient 's non st elevation mi he would be a high risk candidate for a gi endoscopy at this time and therefore in the peri non st elevation mi period would prefer supportive management at this time with follow up including elective gi workup in 4-6 weeks . the patient continued to have guaiac positive stools but no evidence of bright red blood per rectum or large amounts of melena . on the date of discharge the patient has stools that are only trace guaiac positive . 3. endocrine : on admission , all oral hyperglycemics were held and the patient was covered with regular insulin sliding scale q.a.c. and q.h.s. the patient 's fingersticks were in the 150s without any coverage . the patient was restarted on a low dose glipizide at 2.5 mg and adjustments to be made at the next pcp visit . 4. heme : hematocrit is stable . has remained stable above 30 without any need for further transfusions . over the last several days the patient received a total of 4 units packed red blood cells during this admission . on discharge his hematocrit is 35.4 . 5. id : the patient was initially started on levo 250 mg q.d. for a uti . however , his urine cultures were positive for mrsa and the patient completed a seven day course of vancomycin iv . 6. pulmonary : the patient with a history of mrsa left lower lobe pneumonia . we have a low threshold for starting antibiotics ; however , chest x-ray reveals no acute changes and the patient remained 96% on room air throughout this admission without any stigmata over recurrent pneumonia including cough , dyspnea or shortness of breath . 7. renal : the patient came in with a creatinine that was elevated at 2.6 . his baseline was 1.8-2.2 likely pre renal azotemia and subsequently his creatinine improved with hydration and the packed red blood cell transfusions , and his creatinine steadily decreased down to his baseline . on discharge his creatinine is 1.8 . code status : code is dnr / dni . to do plan : 1. the patient is to follow up with pcp , dr. toob obestimeuph in two weeks . 2. the patient is to follow up with the genearocktemp ry health gi service in four weeks . 3. the patient is deconditioned secondary to his week long hospital stay and long rehabilitation stay and will require aggressive physical therapy . 4. the patient should have q.o.d. hematocrit checks to ensure that his hematocrit is above 30 and if it is below 30 should be transfused secondary to his underlying known cad . medications on discharge : include albuterol nebulizer 2.5 mg nebs q.4h , colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , vitamin d 5000 units p.o. q.weekly , iron sulfate 325 mg p.o. t.i.d. , folate 1 mg p.o. q.d. , regular insulin sliding scale , lopressor 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , neutrophos 250 mg p.o. t.i.d. , senna 2 tablets p.o. b.i.d. , multivitamins with minerals one tab p.o. q.d. , trazadone 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia , zocor 40 mg p.o. q.h.s. , atrovent nebulizers 0.5 mg nebs q.i.d. p.r.n. shortness of breath , pulmicort two puffs inhaled b.i.d. and nexium 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. disposition : the patient is to be discharged to rehabilitation for further recuperation and physical rehabilitation . escription document : 9-4697302 ksrgeqm tel dicatated by : leickkote , ci abob attending : norfjescstooks , salene marggay dictation id 6114063 d : 03/21/04 t : 03/21/04

pruesschird is a 25 year-old gentleman with metastatic angiosarcoma who presents as a transfer from nacalv medical center with a fever to 101 , vomiting times one and " left kidney pain " . this patient is an unfortunate young gentleman who was initially diagnosed with a germ cell tumor in the fall of 1997 after undergoing orchiectomy with a left scrotal mass and underwent three cycles of dep therapy for pulmonary involvement . in the summer of 1998 he was found to have a retroperitoneal mass which ultimately revealed angiosarcoma of presumed germ-cell transformation . in early 1999 he underwent resection of this mass however in february of 1999 he was found to have a new right pleural mass and subsequently underwent pleurodesis and chemotherapy with ifosfamide and adriamycin for six cycles . in 05/99 he had increasing abdominal pain and evaluation revealed extensive progressive retroperitoneal disease as well as left hydronephrosis . in early 2000 he was started on therapy with taxol per dr. azel hibbskays and finished this in march of this year . ct imaging at that time was negative for disease . in april of this year , he was found to have acute renal failure with left hydronephrosis and this was treated with percutaneous nephrostomy tube on that side . thereafter he began chemotherapy with taxotere in 05/13 and his nephrostomy tube was removed after being displaced on 06/14/00 . most recently he has had problems with nausea , vomiting , fever and left sided abdominal pain and was admitted to the pointexasp region general hospital on 06/16/00 . that hospital course was sign for hydration , antibiotics for questionable pneumonia and more importantly , tachycardia and respiratory distress ultimately secondary to a large left pulmonary arterial mass that was likely a thrombus . he was treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis ( tpa ) and was discharged on 06/28/00 on high dose , low molecular weight heparin . it was entirely clear that this mass represents a clot , certainly this could have been tumor embolization . finally , the patient developed hyponatremia with a sodium down to 130 and was otherwise eventually discharged to pre health with morphine for comfort care and advanced care plans , not to be resuscitated in the event of a life-threatening situation . mr. pruesschird returns tonight after being found to have a temperature

mid lung zone . kub showed no bowel obstruction . electrocardiogram had normal sinus rhythm with no changes compared with prior electrocardiogram . hospital course : by system . 1. endocrine : the patient 's seizure was thought to be secondary to hypoglycemia in the setting of decreased oral intake on her standard anti-glycemic medications . she will be transferred back to her long term care facility on a czi sliding scale for close management of her sugars pending further assessment of her baseline anti-glycemic medication needs . 2. neurological : the patient has a history of transient ischemic attacks in the past . her seizure was thought secondary to hypoglycemia and she had no further seizure activity in the hospital . she did have some slightly paranoid behavior which her son says is typical . she was continued on her trazodone , neurontin and zyprexa . 3. cardiovascular : the patient had an echocardiogram which revealed a normal ejection fraction , no wall motion

aggressively diuresed and her shortness of breath somewhat improved as did her pedal edema . after discussion with her primary care physician it was decided that she would have further cardiology assessment as an outpatient . 4. pulmonary : the patient was extubated quickly after her admission and maintained good oxygen saturation . she was aggressively diuresed for her minimal congestive heart failure . 5. gastrointestinal : the patient had guaiac positive stools and had an elevated amylase without an elevated lipase . these findings suggest some bowel pathology . the patient is known to have had an upper gastrointestinal bleed in 1997 in the context of coumadin . an outpatient gastrointestinal workup may be indicated . 6. renal : the patient maintained her baseline creatinine which reflects chronic renal insufficiency secondary to her diabetes . 7. infectious disease : the patient was treated on unasyn for concern of cellulitis . the patient 's lower extremities were bilaterally erythematous consistent with chronic venous stasis . however she did have a low grade temperature to 100f and it was thought that given her diabetes and ulcer on her heel she should be

principal diagnosis : severe blunt abdominal trauma . associated diagnosis : 1. grade ii / v laceration of liver , 2. rupture of left renal vein , 3. tear of transverse mesocolon , 4. serosal tear of transverse colon , 5. blunt fracture of the neck of the pancreas . history of present illness and hospital course : mr. breath was a 32 year old previously healthy unbelted driver whose car was hit at high speed by a vehicle driven by an intoxicated driver . the patient was ejected and his vehicle rolled over , possibly over him . he was found awake at the scene , complaining of abdominal pain . he had a blood pressure of 60 systolic upon arrival of the giles min general hospital crew . intravenous fluids was given . he was paralyzed and endotracheally intubated , and a 14 gauge catheter was inserted in his left chest because of poor breath sounds . he arrived at the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital at 02:30 with a blood pressure of 86 and a heart rate of 170 . large bore cannulas were inserted into the femoral veins , bilateral chest tubes were placed , and his blood pressure rose to 110 systolic after two liters of crystalloid . he had an ecchymosis over the medial right costal margin and his abdomen was distended . his hematocrit was 36 , and creatinine 1.6 . the abdominal tap was grossly positive for blood . his blood pressure fell to 60 systolic as he was being transferred to the computerized tomography scan table ; the scan was aborted and he was taken directly to the operating room at 03:00 . at laparotomy , there was a liter of blood in the peritoneal cavity . there was a class ii laceration of the left liver at the falciform ligament which was actively bleeding , a tear of the transverse mesocolon from its base to the bowel wall with active bleeding , a 7 cm serosal tear of the adjacent transverse colon , and a large central retroperitoneal hematoma . control of the super-celiac aorta was obtained , and both left and right sided " mattox " maneuvers were performed . the retroperitoneum was opened , with vigorous bleeding resulting . this was controlled , necessitating ten minutes of aortic clamping and found to have originated from the rupture of the left renal vein one centimeter from its junction with the inferior vena cava . the vein was divided and suture ligated . bleeding from the liver was controlled with sutures . the tears in the transverse mesocolon and colon serosa were repaired . the examination of the remainder of the abdominal contents revealed no other injury ; in particular , the entire anterior surface and the immediately juxtaduodenal posterior surface of the pancreas were normal . the patient was now very stable , and he was taken to the respiratory intensive care unit . the patient had received ten units of packed red blood cells , five units of fresh frozen plasma , seven units of platelets , and nine liters of ringer 's lactate . an intracranial pressure monitoring bolt had been placed by the neurosurgery service staff during the laparotomy . intracranial pressures were normal . that day , cranial computerized tomography scan and cervical spine films were normal . an arch aortogram was normal . over the ensuing twenty-four hours , bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray with poor oxygenation and labile blood pressure requiring pa line guided fluid and pressors developed . the patient had a large fluid requirement with total body capillary leak , decreasing svr , oliguria unresponsive to lasix / mannitol accompanied by a rise in creatinine to 3.2 , worsening ards , a rise in temperature to 103 , and a serum amylase of 1265 . he was returned to the operating room on july 4 . three liters of clear green fluid were found in the abdominal cavity . exploration of the pancreas revealed a posterior fracture a the superior mesenteric vessels . because of the intense diffuse inflammatory reaction that had already set in , it was decided that neither distal pancreatic resection nor roux-en-y drainage was feasible . four large flat jackson-pratt drains were placed , and gastrostomy , jejunostomy , and cholecystostomy tubes , as well as a right subclavian quinton catheter were placed . the patient 's hemodynamics had improved markedly with the evacuation of the peritoneal pancreatic fluid , so that he was no longer on pressors . however , upon transfer from the operating room table to the ricu bed , he suffered a cardiac arrest , which upon investigation was a primary respiratory arrest ; the initial arterial blood gas was 32/88/6.92 . he was successfully resuscitated after fifteen minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and he was taken to the ricu . continuous venovenous hemodialysis was started on july 5 , and continued for most of the remainder of the patient 's course . vancomycin , flagyl , and aztreonam were given for gram negative coccobacilli ( later identified as bacteroides ) that had grown in his blood cultures and gram negative rods ( enterobacter ) in his peritoneal fluid . he was kept sedated and paralyzed because of his severe adult respiratory distress syndrome . total parenteral nutrition was started on july 5 . initial improvement was followed by recurrence of low svr , high cardiac output , ongoing acidosis , requiring norepinephrine infusion in the 30 to 40 mcg per minute range ; drainage from the jackson-pratt drains were minimal despite irrigation and manipulation . the patient was returned to the operating room on july 10 , where several loculated thin fluid collections were drained and obviously necrotic tissue was debrided . it was decided to place more drains and pack the lesser sac with adaptic and laparotomy pads . the abdomen was left open , with the wound margins connected by a sheet of marlex mesh to prevent evisceration . he was returned to the operating room on july 12 , 13 , 16 , 19 , 21 , and 23 for packing change , irrigation and debridement . tracheostomy was also performed on july 17 . there was severe diffuse peritonitis with intense inflammation , infection , and patchy necrosis of peritoneal surfaces and of the distal pancreas . the subsequent overall course was a slow downhill one , with ongoing extreme hyperdynamic ( cardiac output 12 to 15 liters per minute ) and catabolic state . on july 26 , abdominal irrigation and debridement was performed in the ricu ; this was repeated daily for the next three days . on july 29 , the septic state with low svr and acidosis accelerated beyond the control of maximal support . his blood pressure gradually fell , and he died early on july 30 , 1993 . discharge diagnosis : severe blunt abdominal trauma with rupture of liver , left renal vein , pancreas , and transverse mesocolon . special procedures and operations : 1. 7-2-93 , emergency room exploratory laparotomy , repair of liver laceration , repair of torn transverse mesocolon , repair of serosal tear of transverse colon , ligation and division of ruptured left renal vein , exploration of pancreas , 2. 7-4-93 , exploratory laparotomy , irrigation and debridement , pancreatic drainage placement , gastrostomy tube , jejunostomy , cholecystostomy , placement of right subclavian quinton catheter , 3. 7-10-93 , abdominal irrigation and debridement and packing of pancreas , 4. 7-12-93 , 7-14 , 7-20 , 7-22 , and 7-24 , were the same as 7-10-93 , and 7-17 was the same with the addition of tracheostomy were same as 7-10 , complications : severe necrotizing pancreatitis and diffuse peritonitis . medications on discharge : n / a. doctors discharge orders : n / a. estimated disability and probable duration : n / a. disposition : mason street . risspa breath , m.d. tr : un / bmot dd : 08-07-93 td : 08/08/93 cc :

principal diagnosis : 1) foreign body extraction of chicken from esophagus . 2) alcohol abuse . 3) hypopharyngeal cancer . 4) alcoholic cirrhosis . 5) history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation . 6) suspected aspiration pneumonia . 7) history of alcohol withdrawal seizures . 8) status post upper gastrointestinal bleed on this admission . 9) status post ileus secondary to general anesthesia for tooth extraction on this admission . 10) status post tooth extraction . 11) history of hypertension . history of present illness : the patient is a 69-year-old male with a long history of alcohol abuse , withdrawal seizures , and hypopharyngeal cancer now admitted with foreign body in hypopharynx . the patient has a long history of alcohol abuse and alcoholic liver disease as well as seizure disorder related to alcohol withdrawal and multiple retelk county medical center admissions for detox and multiple detox facilities in the past . the patient also recently ( 06/93 ) was diagnosed with infiltrating cancer of the hypopharynx and was scheduled to undergo xrt but had not yet started . recently the patient noticed hoarseness secondary to vocal cord involvement of the tumor . on the day of admission the patient was in a detox center undergoing detox prior to beginning his xrt and was in his usual state of health at that time when he had the acute onset of coughing after swallowing some chicken a la king . the patient also was noted to have secretions draining from his mouth . he denied any shortness of breath at that time . he was transferred to stamgibonnole hospital for further evaluation . in the emergency room the patient underwent egd by gi where a large piece of chicken was visualized at the level of the cricopharyngeus . despite multiple attempts at extraction at that point they were unable to extract the foreign body and it was felt that the patient should be admitted and attempt extraction later in the afternoon . past medical history : 1) alcohol abuse complicated by hepatitis , cirrhosis , seizure disorder , encephalopathy . 2) history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation . 3) hypertension . 4) hypopharyngeal cancer . 5) chronic right lower lobe opacity on chest x-ray noted to be probable scarring vs. fat pad . 6) question of internal capsule cva on ct scan . allergies : penicillin , shellfish , doxycycline , also the patient had rash with ceclor . medications : on transfer included dilantin 100 mg po t.i.d. , ceclor , motrin , percocet p.r.n. physical examination : on admission he is a disheveled elderly male uncooperative with the exam . vital signs revealed the patient was afebrile , blood pressure 150/90 , pulse 86 and regular , respiratory rate 24 , and oxygen saturation 91% on room air . heent exam revealed sclerae were injected , pupils equal and reactive . neck exam no jvd or lymphadenopathy . chest exam coarse upper airway sounds , no rales . cardiovascular exam regular rate and rhythm without murmur . abdominal exam obese , hypoactive bowel sounds , non-tender , some guarding , no rebound tenderness . extremities with trace pedal edema , 1 to 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses . laboratory data : on admission hct 42.1 , white count 7.6 , platelets 132 . dilantin level 13.7 . sma 7 was unremarkable aside from a glucose of 173 and a potassium of 3.1 . lfts revealed alt of 44 , ast of 36 , ldh of 277 , alk phos 155 , total bili 0.7 , and direct bili 0.4. total protein 7.2 , albumin 3.7 , calcium 9.3. pt and ptt were 13.3 and 23.5 respectively . ua was negative with sediment , 4 to 5 white cells , 1 to 2 red cells , and 1+ bacteria . hospital course : by systems - 1) gi - the patient was admitted to the floor and underwent extraction of the piece of chicken from his esophagus later that afternoon . extraction was successful and foreign body was removed piecemeal . egd was performed . subsequently at the site where the chicken was stuck there was no notable trauma or lesion distal to the chicken . there was some gastritis and duodenitis but no frank ulcers . the patient was sent to the floor and gi wise was doing well until approximately 9/22/93 when he developed an ileus one day status post teeth extraction and general anesthesia . the patient also had a gi bleed at that time and an ng tube was placed with removal of 2500 cc of dark brown bilious guaiac positive fluid . the patient was stabilized with fluid and improved quickly from this status over the weekend and hct has been stable since that time . other gi issues include the patient 's hypopharyngeal cancer which will be discussed below . 2) oncology - the patient was diagnosed prior to this admission with hypopharyngeal cancer for which he was going to undergo external radiation therapy for . because of the multiple complications and lack of nutrition and inability of the patient to swallow without aspirating it was felt that this should be delayed until he is under better nutritional status . 3) feeding and nutrition - the patient was unable to eat any food or drink by mouth given that he demonstrated frank aspiration each time he attempted this including with soft solids and puree foods . a swallowing study was performed which clearly demonstrated frank aspiration and poor swallowing mechanism by the patient . several ng tubes were placed and the patient kept pulling the ng tubes out because his mental status was not completely cleared . the patient was sustained on iv fluids with d10 and multivitamins , thiamine , and folate . he was kept npo given his history of aspiration and further attempts were made to fee the patient and finally as the patient 's mental status cleared he was responsive to having an ng feeding tube placed with jevity feeds started . other options were considered including a peg placement as well as surgical placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it was felt that less aggressive measures with an ng tube would be prudent at this juncture given the patient 's poor prognosis for the future . the family was involved in making decisions regarding the patient 's nutritional status and originally felt that iv fluids alone should be used , however , finally decided that some sort of feeding should be undertaken and the ng tube was the initial thought . it is felt that if the ng tube does not work out the patient may need to be reassessed for potential placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it is felt by all parties involved that the aggressive end may also present significant risk to this patient given that an operative procedure may be dangerous and patient has shown significant desaturation and uncooperativeness with his first egd on admission . 4) pulmonary - the patient had a clear chest x-ray other than a right lower lobe opacity consistent with scarring vs. fat pad which has been chronic on admission . the patient was saturating well throughout the initial part of the stay until he had the upper gi bleed on 9/22/93 at which time he also had significant aspiration of vomitus and was considered to have a probable aspiration pneumonia but with vague findings on chest x-ray . the chest x-ray cleared rather rapidly and on the third day post aspiration was consistent with the original admission x-ray . however , after aspiration given that the patient had a white count bump from under 10,000 to 16,000 it was felt that he should be started on antibiotics and he was started on ceftriaxone and clindamycin for a total 10 day course for presumptive aspiration pneumonia . the patient was afebrile throughout this period and tolerated antibiotics well and pneumonia appeared to resolve . no organism was ever cultured out of the sputum . 5) gu - the patient was not entirely responsive to using urinal or the bathroom and at times was incontinent . it was thought that a foley catheter would be most appropriate and he seemed to tolerate this well . he had at one point the possibility of uti but he was asymptomatic and on rechecking the urine there was no sign of urinary tract infection . the patient continued to be asymptomatic . 6) neurological - the patient originally was almost completely non-responsive at least to verbal command but as his hospital course progressed he became somewhat more alert and towards the end of his hospital course was much more alert and oriented usually only times two and was difficult . the patient was much more cooperative towards the end of his stay and much more appropriate , however , he did not seem to fully comprehend the fact that he had cancer and that he would not be able to swallow things by mouth . these issues were explained to him repeatedly , however , he did not appear to comprehend them from day to day . psychiatry evaluated the patient and felt that he was not competent to decide his own affairs . 7) social issues - the wife had obtained health proxy prior to this admission and it was felt that since the patient was not competent to make decisions on his own the wife would make decisions regarding the health status and treatment of the patient . it was decided the patient 's code status would not be dnr , dni . 8) dental - the patient was noted to have very few teeth and it was noted that none appeared viable and it was felt that since he would be undergoing xrt in the future that his teeth should be removed to avoid radiation necrosis in the future when he received his xrt . he underwent extraction of all his teeth on 9/21/93 tolerating the procedure well initially but then developed the ileus as noted above and subsequently a gi bleed . laboratory data on discharge revealed sma 7 with sodium 134 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 , co2 24 , bun 5 , and creatinine 0.9 which has been stable at 0.9 to 1.0 with glucose 96 . cbc revealed hct 30.7 which has been ranging from high of 29 to 31 over the last week . the white count was 7.5 , platelets 196 . the last pt and ptt on 09/26/93 were 13.4 and 27.3 with inr of 1.2 . the last ua and sedimentation revealed rare white blood cells but was otherwise negative and the culture revealed no growth on 09/27/93 . the patient had a chest x-ray which showed a few right upper lobe and one left upper lobe nodule and a follow-up chest x-ray on 09/27/93 showed resolution of these previous nodular shadows . a faint nodule remained in the left upper lobe and it was felt that this is probably not any metastatic disease and not of concern , however , it was suggested that follow-up chest x-ray may be taken to insure that these densities resolve . operative procedures : extraction of all remaining teeth under general anesthesia on 9/21/93 . complications : 1) aspiration pneumonia . 2) gi bleed . 3) ileus secondary to general anesthesia for above operation . disposition : condition on discharge : the patient is stable on discharge . the patient is to be transferred to paw.ryfear medical center for further care including physical therapy , occupational therapy , and further nutritional support . discharge medications : pepcid 20 mg po iv b.i.d. for history of gastritis and gi bleed , heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d. ( this may be discontinued as the patient becomes more mobile and active ) , tube feeds with jevity at 75 cc / hour full strength-please check residuals . feeding tube should be flushed q4h with 20 to 30 cc of warm water to prevent clogging of feeding tube . dictated by : caghala uinteele , m.d. sz23 attending : laymie mellerny shoulder , m.d. in39 qc398/8032 batch : 055 index no. cffclp030b d : 10/05/93 t : 10/05/93 cc : 1. paw.ryfear medical center

history of present illness : the patient is a 78 year old male with dysphagia who was found to have endoscopically two nodules in the esophagus , biopsy of which showed small cell carcinoma . recently , he has complained of pain radiating down the left leg and work up had shown absent left knee jerk . plain films of the lumbosacral spine showed some scoliosis with blastic changes around l3 . the bone marrow biopsy was positive for metastatic carcinoma . the patient was admitted for further evaluation . physical examination : on physical examination on admission , the blood pressure was 164/90 , pulse 88 , respirations 20 . past medical history : note : past medical history included hypertension , treated by cardizem . the patient also has a history of degenerative joint disease . he had an episode of chest pain but ruled out for myocardial infarction . on physical examination , vital signs were as above . the head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was within normal limits , neck was supple , lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion . the abdomen was benign with no masses felt . cardiovascular exam : grade i / vi systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border , single s1 , s2 . the rectal examination showed guaiac negative stool . extremities : within normal limits . the neurological examination showed an absent left knee jerk . cerebellar function was normal . laboratory data : significant for a sodium of 140 , potassium 3.9 , chloride 105 , bun and creatinine 21 and 1.5 , ldh 732 , sgot 84 , alkaline phosphatase 145 , bilirubin 0.3 , calcium 10 , albumen 4.1 , globulin 3.9 , white blood count 8.9 , hematocrit 43.3 , 62 polys , 26 lymphs , 9 monos , 1 eo , 2 basos , prothrombin time 9.8/10.0 , partial thromboplastin time 31.8 . during this admission , an upper gastrointestinal and small bowel follow-through on 9-5-93 was normal . a computerized tomography scan of the chest showed diffuse esophageal wall thickening , dilatation of the esophagus with air fluid levels and no evidence of mediastinitis and some air space disease in a medial segment of the right middle lobe . bone scan showed multiple regions of abnormally increased activity in the dorsal spine and lumbar vertebrae , as well as a right anterior fourth rib , consistent with metastases . a magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain showed no definite evidence of metastatic deposits . there was microvascular disease . a computerized tomography scan of the abdomen showed multiple low density lesions within the liver , consistent with metastatic disease and a 1.5 centimeter low thoracic paraesophageal lymph node , pathological . spleen , pancreas and kidneys were within normal limits . a magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain showed no metastases . the magnetic resonance imaging study of the spine showed extensive bony metastases . there was no evidence of spinal cord compression on magnetic resonance imaging study , though there was evidence of pressure on the l4 nerve root . hospital course : the patient was admitted and he was started on chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the l4 spine region . the first course of chemotherapy was given from 8-19-93 through 8-21-93 . this was vp-16 150 mg daily x three and cisplatin 60 mg daily x three with zofran 11 mg on three occasions as an antiemetic and each dose of cisplatin was preceded by 12.5 grams of decadron . the chemotherapy was well tolerated but did result in febrile neutropenia . granulocyte colony stimulating factor was added . thus white blood count dropped to 0.6 minimum on 8-27 , with platelet count of 63,000 but with granulocyte colony stimulating factor support and antibiotics for febrile neutropenia , white blood count recovered . actually the lowest white blood count was 0.5 on 8-31-93 . on that occasion , platelet count was as low as 17,000 . by 9-8-93 , the white blood count was back up to 16.2 . the patient 's course was complicated by severe pain and intractable nausea and vomiting and severe substernal pain . he is on ms contin and also on duragesic patch . he continued to have nausea and vomiting . the patient was seen in consultation by dr. signs of gastroenterology . eventually , a picc line was inserted and he was given central total parenteral nutrition because of severe anorexia during radiation therapy . two weeks passed without a bowel movement because of the lack of intake and eventually that resolved . it was felt that endoscopy would be of value . a central venous line was placed on 8-29-93 . after neutropenia resolved by 9-2-93 with white blood count rising to 2.2 and platelet count to 28,000 , endoscopy became feasible . this was done on 9-4-93 and there were inflammatory exudates , ulcerations , and granulation tissue in the middle and distal third of the esophagus , but the tumor polypoid masses had completely disappeared . cytologic brushings of the ulcerated areas were positive for cancer cells but deep biopsies were negative . the patient was treated with fluconazole in case there was any monilia , although biopsy did not confirm the presence of monilia . gradually during the hospitalization , the sternal pain improved , as did the pain in the left hip and the patient became able to ambulate somewhat . he was making progress and accordingly , a second course of chemotherapy was given at lower dose . he received vp-16 100 mg daily x three , 9-12 , 9-13 and 9-14-93 , and cisplatin 40 mg daily x three on that same date with zofran 10 mg. the only problem was some recurrent nausea . the radiation therapy was finally finished on the day of discharge , 9-19-93 , at which point the patient was able to take fluids and food but was still occasionally vomiting . his white blood count was in the range of 53,000 because neupogen had been started with his second cycle of chemotherapy and will be continued until it is clear that he has passed the nadir of any neutropenia to be expected from this cycle of chemotherapy . discharge diagnosis : 1. metastatic small cell cancer of esophageal origin to liver and bone , 2. severe ulcerations of the esophagus at sites of prior tumor , 3. intractable nausea and vomiting , 4. pain syndrome , largely resolved , 5. hypertension . medications on discharge : prilosec 20 mg po qa.m. , senokot one to two tablets po q.day as needed , colace

principal diagnosis : end-stage renal disease . associated diagnosis : 1. right nephrectomy . 2. cadaveric renal transplant . 3. acute thrombosis . 4. transplant nephrectomy . 5. pulmonary emboli . 6. hypertension . 7. coronary artery disease . 8. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . 9. hypercoagulable state . 10. perforated viscus . 11. abdominal abscesses . 12. sepsis . 13. respiratory failure . history of present illness : the patient was a 53-year-old male with a longstanding history of renal disease with multiple complications and problems related to vascular access and hypercoagulable state . these culminated in an attempted cadaveric kidney transplant undertaken on 12/16/97 , which was complicated by thrombosis and necrosis of the cadaveric renal vein within 24 hours . this required a transplant nephrectomy . hospital course and treatment : the patient 's course was subsequently characterized by recurrent pneumonias , possibly due to aspiration , and by hemodynamic instability . he was transferred to the medical intensive care unit from the transplant service for ventilatory management in the setting of hypotension . on transfer , the patient was not sedated , but was unresponsive and extremely dyssynchronous with the ventilator . the patient was found to have substantial auto peep with an elevated dead space . a pulmonary arteriogram on 01/03/98 demonstrated multiple pulmonary emboli , likely less than one week old , possibly introduced at the time of the renal vein thrombosis of 12/19/97 . an inferior vena cava filter was placed ; lower extremity noninvasive studies were negative . the patient required high pressures to ventilate adequately , possibly related to an abdominal compartment syndrome . the patient had undergone two abdominal procedures following explantation . the physiology at the time of transfer to the medical intensive care unit was consistent with a septic process . ct scan demonstrated retroperitoneal collection containing both free air and extravasated contrast material . for the concern of a perforated viscus , the patient was taken to exploratory laparotomy on 01/06/98 , during which the bowel was run without evidence of perforation . the patient remained unstable . he was taken to fluoroscopy , where oral contrast was demonstrated to be extravasating through a posterior duodenum . for this reason , he was taken again to the operating room on 01/08/98 , at which time a gastrojejunostomy was performed with stapling across the gastroduodenal junction , introduction of five jackson-pratt drains into the retroperitoneal mass , cholecystotomy tube , gastrostomy tube , and jejunostomy tube . the patient had an extensive estimated blood loss requiring multiple blood products and fluid resuscitation therapy . accompanying this during this period were elevations in liver function studies and amylase and lipase consistent with pancreatic inflammation . the patient was aggressively treated with fluid resuscitation and pressors for his septic physiology . there was no evidence of cardiac tamponade or specific underlying coronary dysfunction . he was treated with appropriate antibiotics for his serratia pneumonia , as well as for his abdominal process . the patient was felt to have an underlying hypercoagulable state , thought to be the source for the repeated clots . because of the bleeding problems , however , it was felt that full heparinization would not be prudent , and the patient was treated with pneumo-boots and subcutaneous heparin . attention was paid to a variety of metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities , which were corrected appropriately . nonetheless , mr. less continued to remain critically ill with only very transient mild improvement with drainage of additional retroperitoneal fluid . he remained pressor dependent , as well as dependent upon mechanical ventilatory assistance . his course was complicated by atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion . he had an ongoing requirement for high volume resuscitation and was persistently acidotic despite cv-vvh in the face of bicarbonate replenishment . the patient also appeared to have stool from his jackson-pratt site and right oblique incision . bloody drainage from his increasingly distended abdomen was noted . extensive discussions were carried out with mrs. less condition was irretrievable . it was felt that the patient had continued massive retroperitoneal contamination and probable multiple enteric fistulae from an ischemic bowel . dr. cantsleddjesc felt that no surgical approach to this problem or further intervention or radiologic procedures would be helpful . all physicians and the family were in agreement that the most appropriate approach was to institute comfort measures . this was done , and the patient appeared to be comfortable at the time of death with his family at his side on 1/16/98 . i l. sterpskolk , m.d. tr : vcp dd : 05/25/98 td : 05/30/98 8:30 a cc : le freierm , jr , m.d. kiverl na cantsleddjesc , m.d. i lynin sterpskolk , m.d. eti chaelka mulkevi , m.d. cc : dr. less 
principal diagnosis : chordoma . procedure : 1/22/97 right suboccipital craniotomy with microresection of tumor with laminectomy . history of present illness : mr. marker is a 60 year-old man presented with a two year history with right neck pain . an initial ct scan was negative , however , eventually a scan in august , 1996 showed a right wedge skull base mass . in september , 1997 he underwent cerebral angiography complicated by an embolic cerebrovascular accident which presented with confusion in an right homonymous hemianopsia . he was taken to the intensive care unit . a follow-up mri showed low attenuation lesions in both occipital lobes consistent with embolic stroke . he was treated with aspirin . november 19 , 1997 , he underwent a resection of a skull base chordoma and a lateral mandibulotomy with tracheostomy . postoperatively he had a right true vocal cord paralysis with evidence of aspiration and he therefore received gelfoam insertion injection into the vocal cord and a peg was preformed . he was discharged home with at follow-up mri and on december 25 , 1997 again revealed a large ill defined lobulated skull based mass with a mass effect on the medulla . now preoperatively he reports occasional sharp pains in his right jaw that last about five seconds then resolves as well as loss of his right peripheral vision , difficulty swallowing . he is taking some liquids p.o. but also has g-tube feedings q.2h. past medical history : status post tonsillectomy , status post appendectomy , status post lumbar fusion remote . diet : jevity plus one can q.12h. by g-tube , some liquids . allergies : the patient is allergic to codeine which causes nausea and morphine which causes swelling . medications on admission : aspirin discontinued in two weeks prior to admission . social history : denies use of alcohol and tobacco . he is married and lives in nebraska , works as a car dealer , has four grandchildren . physical examination : vital signs : heart rate 64 , blood pressure 120/80 . general : this is a pleasant 60 year-old man whose distressed . heent , normocephalic , atraumatic , well healed right jaw incision , slight swelling right jaw slightly tender to the touch , there is no erythema . lungs are clear to auscultation . heart regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs , gallops or rubs . abdomen g-tube intact , soft non-tender , active bowel sounds . neurological alert and oriented times three , speech is fluent although there is some difficulty of tongue movement . cranial nerves , right visual field deficit , decreased gag , tongue is atrophic and deviates to the right . strength five out of five bilateral upper and lower extremities . deep tendon reflexes 2+ symmetric , toes downgoing . cerebella intact . gait steady . hospital course : this 60 year-old man with a right suboccipital chordoma status post prior resection was admitted and then underwent on jan 22 , 1997 a right suboccipital craniotomy with microresection of tumor along with a laminectomy . postoperatively , he was taken to the neurosurgical intensive care unit where he remained intubated . he was extubated on postoperative day number one . his neurological examination remained unchanged with continued right tongue deviation and lack of gag reflex . he was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number two and he was ambulating . he was seen by physical therapy who noted that he had problems with balancing and he used a rolling walker . he noticed some nose dripping on postoperative day number four however in the next several days there was no evidence of this cerebrospinal fluid leak as he denied any further nose dripping however he was placed on antibiotics to cover a possible cerebrospinal fluid leak . on postoperative day number eight he again reported leaking from the right nostril . he vomited once and had intermittent headaches . a head ct was done to evaluate a possible hydrocephalus , no hydrocephalus was seen where there was an old infarct in the right frontal lobe white matter and the occipital region with a pseudomeningocele , status post resection of the right skull based tumor extending to the c2 level . a lumbar drain was placed and for the next five days 50 cc was drained every eight hours . a culture taken from the lumbar drain showed staphylococcus aureus resistant to the nafcillin which he was receiving and he was therefore placed on vancomycin . he was also receiving ofloxacin for a presumed aspiration pneumonia and a staphylococcus aureus from his cerebrospinal fluid was sensitive to both vancomycin and ofloxacin . he was followed by the speech pathology team who noted that he still had evidence of aspiration . a video swallow was done which showed moderately severe oral pharyngeal dysphasia with premature spill over and laryngeal penetration with aspiration of some liquids . because of continuing complaints by mr. marker about nausea with his tube feedings and concern with his aspiration the g-tube feedings were not ideal . he underwent a conversion of his gastrostomy tube to an transgastrojejunostomy tube by the interventional radiologist on feb 04 , 1997 . prior to admission mr. marker had been taking one can of jevity every two hours as a bolus . after conversion to a jejunostomy tube one would normally use continuous feedings , however mr. marker did not want to use continuous feedings , he prefers the boluses which would not require him to be attached to a feeding tube . it was explained to him that this can result in diarrhea but he has elected to continue bolus feedings . his visiting nurse will be instructed to observe for diarrhea and if problems develop a home jejunostomy feeding tube apparatus will be obtained . his lumbar drain was removed after five days . he was observed overnight and there is no current evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak . he is therefore being discharged on postoperative day number fifteen . medications on discharge : 1) ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week . 2) jevity plus one can q.2h. he will have visiting nurse and home physical therapy services . follow-up : follow-up will be with dr. sick in one weeks time . he will needed a follow-up ct or mri for the pseudomeningocele . addendum mr. marker will be restarted on his preoperative aspirin as he is now far enough out from his surgery . medications on discharge : 1) aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. 2) ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. times seven days . dictated by : stisie h. tikfreiermdreps , m.d. ba87 attending :

radiation therapy consultation . 4) dermatology consultation . 5) im villtro university medical center medical oncology consultation . history of present illness : the patient is a 39 year old white female , gravida i , para l , with a history of recurrent stage lb cervical carcinoma . she was originally diagnosed with cervical cancer in may of l989 . she was staged as lb and pathology showed a small cell neuroendocrine tumor of the cervix . she underwent a radical hysterectomy . there were positive margins and positive nodes . in december of l990 , she had a vaginal apex mass on examination . cystoscopy and proctoscopy were negative . a ct , however , confirmed a large pelvic mass with bilateral hydronephrosis . a biopsy of the mass revealed poorly differentiated metastatic small cell neuroendocrine tumor . between march and may of l990 , she received two cycles of chemotherapy in two parts alternating cisplatin and vp-l6 with vincristine , cytoxan , and adriamycin . in june of l990 , she underwent radiation therapy and in july of l99l , a right ventriculogram showed an ejection fraction of 48% . her chemotherapy was then changed to a single agent of cytoxan . also in july of l99l , she had right hip pain . there was a bony metastasis . orthopedic surgeons did an open reduction and internal fixation of a lytic lesion involving the right femur . on july 30 through august 4 of l99l , she received her first cycle of ifosfamide and mesna . she had prolonged neutropenia and on august 28 , she was admitted with a headache . ct scan at that time was normal . she had non-focal findings per the neurology service . on september 6 , she began the next cycle of second line chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin , ifosfamide , and mesna . since the last cycle of chemotherapy , she has had continued right hip pain and right mid lateral abdominal discomfort . she also had complaint of a left perineal rash over the last two weeks . she was started on zovirax on october 3 . she presents for a bone scan , blood transfusion , and consideration of her third cycle of second line chemotherapy . past medical history : as above . past surgical history : radical hysterectomy in may of l989 , open reduction and internal fixation of femur in july of l99l , and examination under anesthesia , cystoscopy , and proctoscopy in december of l990 . past obstetrical history : spontaneous vaginal delivery times three . current medications : zovirax 200 mg five times daily , methadone 50 mg t.i.d. , and ativan p.r.n. physical examination : blood pressure was ll0/70 , heart rate 84 , and temperature 97.4 . heent : no thyromegaly . chest : clear to auscultation . heart : regular rate and rhythm . there was no distinct costovertebral angle tenderness . abdomen : slightly distended . there was mild tenderness to palpation in the right mid lateral abdomen . there were no peritoneal signs and no guarding . there were normal bowel sounds . extremities : without edema . pelvic : by dr. friednantflirt revealed regrowth of the pelvic tumor . there was a dry scaly rash with multiple small scabs on the left perineum and posterior thigh . laboratory examination : her electrolytes were within normal limits , her bun was ll , and creatinine was 0.8 . her alt was l0 , total bilirubin 0.4 , and magnesium was l.8 . her admission cbc revealed a white blood count of 2.27 , with 56 polys and 3 bands . her hematocrit was 22.9 and platelets were l24 . hospital course : the patient was admitted for bone scan and blood transfusion as well as consideration of further chemotherapy . the bone scan was performed which revealed multiple metastases to the spine , ribs , and skull . there was noted , however , to be new pain in the right shoulder and , in fact , there was a lytic lesion involving the right shoulder and femur . plain film revealed a moth-eaten appearance consistent with probable new metastases . the radiation service was consulted and noted that past areas treated including her right femur , her thoracic spine , pelvis , and right posterior ribs had all responded to radiation therapy and agreed that treating the right shoulder humerus and the right hip which had not been previously treated was reasonable . planning for further radiation therapy was arranged for next week by the radiation service . she was also seen by the dermatology service who examined the rash and felt it was most likely a contact dermatitis . she was given synalar cream and eucerin cream as a moisturizer . the patient also received a unit of donor direct blood . due to dr. friednantflirt 's concern that the tumor was growing despite the available chemotherapeutic regimen , the im villtro university medical center medical oncology service was consulted . they noted , as well , that she had failed the most active agents against small cell carcinomas . however , they felt that at the venbonlea health , there were several possible options including a possible phase i trial regimen . the plan at this time was made to further consider the options and the patient will follow-up with im villtro university medical center next week . on the evening of 12/26/06 , the patient was discharged home in stable condition . disposition : discharge medications : methadone l5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , synalar cream b.i.d. , and eucerin cream . sb325/2198 lako c.

axis , normal intervals , no stt wave abnormalities . hospital course : the patient was admitted to team four for cardiac monitoring and ruling out for mi . hospital course by system : 1. cardiovascular : the patient ruled out for mi by cardiac markers . the patient was set to go for a dobutamine stress test on 11/16/04 given her history of copd , but the stress portion was canceled when she was down there due to fever and hypotension . the next day , she underwent a cardiac echo ( transthoracic echocardiogram ) . this echo showed lv ejection fraction of 50% with no wall motion abnormality . however , the right ventricular was diffusely hypokinetic . it was suboptimally imaged , so there was no rvsp given . the patient also suffered a hypotensive episode while in the endoscopy suite for her egd on 11/17/04 . this responded to fluid bolus . the patient was then transferred to medicine team d given her tenuous hemodynamic status . the patient , several days later 11/23 , underwent another dobutamine stress test . this stress test , although complicated by hypotension again , to the 60 's or 70 's was completed and there was some mild anterior septal thinning , but no evidence of ischemia and an ef from this test was 76% . clearly , the patient 's hemodynamic vascular status was very sensitive to dobutamine . 2. infectious disease : on hospital day #2 , the patient was noted to have increased dyspnea on exertion . the next day she developed a fever and she was started on levofloxacin for a potential uti . she continued to have low-grade fevers and on the next day , 11/17/04 , her chest x-ray showed possible new right upper lobe infiltrates . she was then started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin . her urine legionella antigen was negative . on 11/22/04 , she was noted to have gram-positive cocci in her sputum . she was started on vancomycin for this . these bacteria turned out to be mrsa and she was continued on her vancomycin . she had picc line placed on the day prior to discharge for home vancomycin administration . 3. gi : the patient had an episode of nausea on the morning of 11/16/04 associated with some cough , apparent emesis . gi was consulted for an egd , however , while she was in the endoscopy suite , as mentioned above , she had a hypotensive episode , which responded to some fluid boluses . finally , on the day prior to discharge , she was stabilized to the point that she could have her egd . the egd did show three esophageal ulcers that were localized and apparent suggestion of pill esophagitis . her stomach and duodenum were normal and it was suggested that she change her nexium doses to daily and that she also drink plenty of fluids and water with meals , sit upright when she would eat her meals to decrease the chance of pills eroding her esophagus . 4. shortness of breath : as mentioned above , the patient did develop mrsa pneumonia that was started to be treated with vancomycin and she did also develop an oxygen requirement the day prior to discharge . at most , her oxygen requirement was 4-5 liters and on the day prior to discharge , she was satting well on two liters of nasal cannula . this was thought to be due to her pneumonia ; however , with her right ventricular hypokinesis , it is also possible that she may have an element of pulmonary hypertension and may warrant further investigation as an outpatient , for example , with chest ct . 5. derm : several days prior to discharge , the patient developed some erythematous rash under her left breast and left side that was thought to be due to yeast . she was started on some miconazole cream . the rash was always localized to her left side , sometimes extending down to her leg , but never on the right side . the rash appeared to be resolving by the time of discharge . medications on discharge : tums , 500-1250 mg po tid . albuterol inhaler . lipitor , 20 daily . prozac , 60 daily . flovent inhaler , 220 mcg bid . atrovent , two

chief complaint : epiglottitis . history of present illness : this is an 87 year old white female who is otherwise healthy by history and presented with a several day history of upper respiratory infection . of note , the patient does not smoke and does not drink . she was seen by her local internist after having several days of blood-tinged sputum which she was coughing up and some mild throat discomfort . she did not complain of significant pain and was able to tolerate p.o.s. she denied any respiratory distress although her family thought she may have had some labored breathing at one point . she was seen by her local physician who was concerned that she may have a malignancy secondary to the history of hemoptysis and throat discomfort . he recommended that she see a local otolaryngologist . examination by the local otolaryngologist appareantly revealed significant swelling in the epiglottic area although we had no true record of what was seen . there was also a question of a carcinomatous lesion on the left side of the epiglottis . apparently the findings were significant enough to cause this otolaryngologist to recommend that the family bring the patient emergently to ez ephtro health center where she be admitted for steroids and antibiotics and apparently the question of a tracheostomy was raised . the patient 's granddaughter , however , works at retelk county medical center and therefore the family elected to bring the patient home and then bring her to retelk county medical center . she presented to the emergency room with some throat discomfort , some mild hoarseness , which she said had been progressing over the last few days . she was sitting straight upright although was not having any respiratory distress . she did report a lot of salive in the back of her throat . she was febrile to 101.7 . ent consult was obtained . a lateral neck film revealed significant swelling of the epiglottis . ent examination was then to be performed . chest x-ray showed significant kiphosis but otherwise no significant lesions at all . past medical history : negative . past surgical history : negative . medications on admit : none . allergies : none . smoking none . family history : negative . alcohol none . social history : lives in an old age facility but is quite active and quite independent . physical examination : the patient was sitting upright and was not drooling and was able to swallow her secretions although she did have a very wet voice which got progressively more hoarse during the examination . she had no respiratory distress but did choose to sit in an upright position . her ear examination was normal . nasal examination was normal . oral cavity was normal . neck : revealed fullness in the submental and suprahyoid regions with mild tenderness which was consistent with edema of the soft tissues without significant mass . neck : otherwise normal and the trachea was midline . hypopharyngeal examiantion revealed a severely edematous , yellowish-white epiglottis with significantly edematous base of tongue which had marked watery edema . the left pyriform was obliterated by edema . the right pyriform was narrowed by edema . the epiglottis was so edematous that is was pushed back posteriorly and abutted the posterior oropharynx completely obscuring the larynx . the patient had no stridor and it was clear that she must be breathing around the epiglottis . there was blood oozing out from the left lateral epiglottis at the region consistent with its base although this was unclear for identification secondary to edema and it was possible that she may have had a lesion in this area . lungs : clear . heart : regular rate and rhythm . s1 and s2 , no murmurs , rubs or gallops . abdomen : soft , nontender , positive bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly , no bruits . no masses . extremities : normal . back : showed significant thoracic kiphosis . laboratory examination : revealed a wbc count of 11.6 , h and h of 10.7 and 31.7 , platelet count of 268 , differential 94 polys , 0 bands , 5 lymphs , one mono . as noted above , lateral neck film revealed marked edema of the epiglottis . the chest x-ray showed signficant kiphosis with several areas of increased interstitial markings but otherwise negative . hospital course : the patient was felt to have epiglottitis , possibly secondary to a malignancy , especially in her age group . she was started on iv ceftriaxone two grams and was given humidification . due to the marked amount of edema , it was felt that she should go the operating room emergently for elective intubation . she was taken to the operating room at approximately 2:00 a.m. which was approximately one hour after being evaluated by ent and was intubated awake over a fiberoptic bronchoscope through the left nares with nasal anesthetic only with a #6 endotracheal tube . the patient was sedated . direct laryngoscopy was performed but this revealed only a large amount of base of tongue edema with minimally visible epiglottis which was also significantly edematous and no distinct mass or lesion could be noted . she was transferred to the sicu where she was kept sedated and was given ceftriaxone one gram q. 12 h. as well as iv steroids for the first 24 hours consisting of decadron 8 mg q. 8 h. x 3 doses in addition to 10 mg that she received in the emergency room on the way down to the operating room . her initial hospital course while intubated was significant for an episode of atrial fibrillation which she went into in the operating room . at the end of the case she had had a central line placed also for frequent blood draws at the request of the sicu house office . her episode of atrial fibrillation as we planned to take her from the operating room after both the intubation and central line placement had been completed . she had no trouble with blood pressure with this atrial fibrillation with rates going up to 150 . she was given a dose of digoxin but broke spontaneously approximately two minutes after the digoxin was given . ekg and enzymes were obtained and showed the first degree av block that she had had on her preoperative ekg but no other findings at all . she continued in normal sinus rhythm and was transferred to the icu where she was monitored . her blood gases and o2 saturations correlated well and we used o2 saturations to follow her as well as venous gases and she continued to maintain good o2 saturation . she was kept ventilated because she was kept sedated . she went into an svt the afternoon after intubation and a decision was made to digitalize her , keeping her level between approximately .6 and 1 . she continued in sinus rhythm after this episode of svt and again had no problems with her blood pressure during that . her edema decreased over the next two days and repeat fiberoptic examination on both 4/3 and 4/4 revealed decreasing edema . on 4/5/91 in the icu under controlled conditions , she was electively extubated and had no problems . she was kept on ceftriaxone but no further steroids were given . examination at that time revealed question of a lesion at the left lateral glossoepiglottic fold . otherwise her examination was normal with good visualization of the larynx and significant decrease in size of the epiglottis . of note , during her first hospital day when she received steroids her blood sugars did increase significantly and therefore she was started on insulin . once the steroids were stopped , the insulin was able to be stopped . tube feedings were started on 4/3/91 and the ng tube was discontinued on 4/5/91 prior to extubation to give a better look at the epiglottis prior to extubating her . after extubation she was watched in the icu for 24 hours and she did well except for some episodes of confusion happening the night of extubation and also the next morning . again , mi was ruled out and metabolic tests were within normal limits . o2 saturations looked good . it was felt that this was a mild episode of icu psychosis . she was followed on the regular floor 24 hours after extubation and had no further problems with her airway . she was maintained on ceftriaxone and then switched to augmentin and remained afebrile . her white counts came down . blood cultures which had been drawn at the time of intubation were negative . she had a geriatric consult due to her confusion and they suggested as we had already done to stop all sedatives and sleeping medications . cardiology was contacted and recommended that given her history she should be taken off all digoxin and just watched and that her svts may have been just secondary to stress of intubation . unfortunately the episodes of atrial fibrillation and svt were apparently not documented well enough in terms of ekg strips to aid cardiology and therefore , they gave us an informal consult so that no formal consult will be found in this chart . nonetheless , their input was greatly appreciated and she was taken off of digoxin and had no further problems with her heart . her mental status began to clear under the family 's request . disposition : on 4/9/91 she was sent home on a week of augmentin and will followup in the ent clinic . our plan will be to establish whether or not she truly had an epiglottic lesion . she , of note , had no history of foreign body ingestion or any abrasion or trauma to this area . if she does have a lesion , then we may entertain , given her age , the possibility of radiating this lesion as opposed to putting her through laryngectomy . discharge medications are augmentin 500 mg t.i.d. x 7 days . the patient is to followup in the ent clinic in approximately one week . discharge diagnosis : epiglottitis , question secondary to epiglottic malignancy . rg556/4903 eento works , m.d. nl6 d : 04/10/91 batch : 5391 report : u5989c79 t : 04/10/91 dicatated by : sa jescwierst , m.d.

cell count 5.8 , hematocrit 41.4 , platelets 109 , negative urine analysis . chest x-ray increased opacity in the left lower lobe which likely represents pneumonia and / or pleural effusion . there was a superimposed radiolucency in this region as well which may also represent a hiatal hernia . when the patient 's condition permit pa and lateral view of the chest is recommended to exclude pleural effusion and further evaluate the presence of a hiatal hernia . the patient had a followup chest x-ray on 8/5/98 that showed low lung volumes with a vague opacity in the right upper lobe that may be artifactual related to the cardiac electrode . a repeat chest x-ray is advised . there is a large overall density with an air fluid level in the left lower zone posteriorly that is likely a hiatal hernia . there are also displaced fractures of the left 8th , 9th and 10th ribs . head computer tomogram showed no evidenced of intracerebral hemorrhage , acute large vessel territorial infarction or mass effect . there were nonspecific low attention white matter t2 changes most likely secondary to small vessel disease . there was a possible old lacunar infarct of the left thalamus . his electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 90 with normal axis and slightly widened qrs at .14 seconds and qs inferiorly in ii , iii and avf . there were no acute st-t wave changes . summary : in summary , this an 81 year old gentleman with a significant cardiac history and alcohol history who presented to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital with loss of consciousness , who had a tox screen and a negative head computer tomogram who likely is suffering from an alcohol related fall versus syncope . hospital course : he was admitted to lyjoneshutchepawalt cleod exre hospital for observation . it was felt that he should be ruled out for an myocardial infarction given his cardiac history and was placed in two point restraints . when the patient came to the floor he was angry and upset about admitted to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital instead of the bridges hospital and was somewhat combative . he admitted to drinking 1 pint or so of alcohol not every day but the last drink was the night prior to admission to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital and he had a couple of glasses of wine . he was quite confused in relaying the history and very tangential in his replies . he says he was out to lunch some friends to eat pizza at a restaurant on valemin . he decided to go to the basemen so they could eat in privacy when he was hit over the head by police with a gun and lost consciousness at the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital emergency ward . he was quite paranoid , agitated and delusional during an interview and there is no evidence to support the patient 's history and recall of events leading to the hospitalization . hospital course by system . 1. neurologically : the patient is completely alert , awake and oriented x 3 . the patient shows no evidence of alcohol withdrawal although he was prophylactically treated with ativan and was given multivitamins , thiamine and folate . psychiatry saw the patient and felt that he was suffering from alcohol related syndrome versus some component of pugilist brain given the fact that he was a boxer in the past . they felt that there was no acute psychiatric issue at hand . 2. cardiovascular : the patient ruled out for an myocardial infarction with peak creatinine phosphokinase of 350 and flat isoenzymes . he deserves a full syncope as an inpatient and is stable for transfer from a cardiovascular standpoint . this will be pursued at the bridges hospital . he is maintained on his antihypertensive of lisinopril and his anti-hyperlipidemic of gemfibrozil and gets an aspirin . condition on discharge : good .

physical examination , the patient was an uncomfortable appearing elderly male who was not complaining of pain . his vital signs included a blood pressure of 150/70 , pulse 66 , respirations 17 , temperature 98.3 . the head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was remarkable for a jugular venous distention of eight centimeters . the carotids were without bruits . crackles were heard two thirds of the way up of the lung base on the right and one half the way up on the left . cardiovascular exam : s3 and s4 were heard , but no murmur or rub were noted . the point of maximal impulse was not palpable . the abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended . the rectal examination was unremarkable . extremities : within normal limits . the neurological examination was unremarkable . laboratory data : included a sodium of 141 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 103 , bicarbonate 26.9 , bun and creatinine 45/2.5 , glucose 59 , white blood count 8.9 , hemoglobin 8.8 , hematocrit 26.5 , platelet count 172,000 , prothrombin time 9.5 , partial thromboplastin time 27.8 . the urinalysis revealed 10-20 white blood cells , 10-20 red blood cells . admission chest x-ray showed some cephalization of flow and an irregular right hemidiaphragm . the electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 65 beats per minute , with biphasic t 's in i , iv , v1 and t2 . st depression and biphasic t 's were noted in v3 through v6 . no q waves were noted . picture was believed to be consistent with anteroseptal ischemia , right bundle branch block , and question of left bundle branch block . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital for further evaluation and definite treatment of his cardiac disease , as well as evaluation of his chronic renal insufficiency and multiple medical problems . he underwent numerous preoperative radiologic studies , including a transcranial doppler , which revealed moderate to severe right pica stenosis but no evidence of disease in the vertebrals , proximal basilars , posterior communicating arteries , middle cerebral arteries , anterior cerebral arteries , or ophthalmic systems . he also underwent a preoperative renal scan which showed decreased perfusion bilaterally , and borderline asymmetric renal function , 57% left , 43% right . the renal ultrasound revealed normal kidneys bilaterally with no evidence of hydronephrosis . the impression of the renal consultant was that the patient 's renal function was likely secondary to mild ischemic acute tubular necrosis and hypoperfusion . no evidence of cholesterol emboli were noted . on 8-27-92 , the patient was brought to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending , reversed saphenous vein graft to circumflex , sequential reversed saphenous vein to acute marginal and posterior left ventricular artery . mr. ear did well in the postoperative period and continued to be followed closely by the cardiology , renal , and diabetes and cardiac surgery services . the patient was then extubated on the second postoperative day in the surgical intensive care unit . he did have some trouble with postoperative hypertension , with systolics to the 150 's and was placed on captopril , 6.25 mg po t.i.d. his blood pressure subsequently came under better control and his captopril was discontinued . his renal function slowly improved throughout his postoperative course and by the day prior to discharge , his bun and creatinine were 48 and 1.9 . dr. freiermthalskush felt that this represented an appropriate improvement in the patient 's acute tubular necrosis , and that he was probably approaching his baseline renal function . on the sixth postoperative day , he was transferred out of the surgical intensive care unit to the regular floor , without incident . he did well subsequently with good control of his blood glucoses and blood pressures . the patient is being transferred to nacalv medical center in stable condition , with his sternal wounds healing well . his saphenous vein graft donor site has been seeping somewhat and his

bilaterally and plantar flexors were 4 minus bilaterally . coordination showed her to have no strength in the right upper extremity and no tremor but weak on the left upper extremity with finger-to-nose movements . laboratory examination : on admission included a sodium of l4l , a chloride of l06 , a potassium of 4.3 , a bicarbonate of 26 , and a bun of l0 . creatinine was 0.8 and glucose was 96 . otherwise , the sma 20 was within normal limits . white count was 5.5 , hematocrit was 43.5 , and mcv was 9l . platelet count was 350,000 . differential included 66 polys , 24 lymphocytes , 3 monocytes , and l eosinophil . pt was l3.l and ptt was 30.9 . urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of l.0l5 , a ph of 8.0 , l+ ketones , and no blood . chest x-ray showed hyperinflation bilaterally and loss of the anterior clear space on the lateral film likely secondary to arm position since the patient was unable to raise up her arm from weakness stemming from her multiple sclerosis . ekg showed baseline artifacts , sinus tachycardia at l05 , pr interval of 0.l6 , qrs of 0.08 , qt of 0.36 , an axis of 60 degrees , poor r wave progression with transition after the v4 lead , t wave flattening in ii and f , and t wave inversion in iii . no old ekg was available for comparison . hospital course : 1) multiple sclerosis - the patient underwent lumbar puncture which revealed a glucose of 73 , a protein of 38 , positive oligoclonal bands with an igg to albumin ratio of 0.485 . cell count was l white cell and 5l red cells with a differential of 90 lymphocytes and l0 monocytes in tube number four and two white cells and 600 red cells with a differential of 5 polys , 90 lymphocytes , and 5 monocytes in tube number one . patient also had an mri scan of the head which showed a lesion in the left pons consistent with multiple sclerosis . serum igg was elevated at l,520 . spep showed an elevated gamma spike of l.83 and was otherwise within normal limits . the patient underwent lenti pidesrah non community hospital multiple sclerosis treatment , group ii protocol with cytoxan and acth induction with the plan for maintenance methylprednisolone after discharge . she tolerated the protocol medications well except for some nausea and vomiting which was relatively well controlled with anti-emetic medication and also some very mild hematuria to the tune of 20 to 25 red blood cells on micro . this was , in fact , consistent with the fact that she had an indwelling foley placed on admission after post-void residual was noted to be 200 cc of urine . she received occupational therapy and physical therapy during the hospitalization . 2) anemia - patient had a steady drop in hematocrit from the admission value of 43.5 to the range of about 3l by hospital day number eight which remained stable at this point . she had guaiac negative stools , no menses , no significant hematuria , and no signs of hemolysis . work-up included an iron of l24 , tibc of 207 , a ferritin of l24 , and bl2 and folate were pending but unlikely to be contributing to this acute drop . haptoglobin was l79 with a normal bilirubin and a normal ldh . glucose was 6 , phosphate deficiency was checked with a normal level of 25 being measured , and reticulocyte count of less than 0.l% was noted at one point with follow-up reticulocyte count of 0.l% noted on the day prior to discharge . this was felt to be consistent with decreased bone marrow production of new red cells and possibly a hematocrit drop secondary to in-hospital phlebotomy with some dilutional component secondary to intravenous and p.o. hydration . patient did not show coincident decrease in white count or platelet count . a clot was sent to the blood bank , however , the patient did not require a transfusion . she did receive bactrim for a urinary tract infection and this medication was discontinued given its potential for aplasia in the bone marrow . patient will be followed up with subsequent cbc on the september , the september , the september , and the septemberth of 2006 to assure that her hematocrit recovers . 3) urinary tract infection - patient had too numerous to count white cells on urinalysis on 08/15/90 and was thus begun on bactrim ds one tablet p.o. b.i.d. subsequently , urine culture prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy grew out pan sensitive e. coli , greater than l00,000 including sensitivities to bactrim . patient received a seven day course of bactrim ds one tablet b.i.d. with resolution of symptoms and subsequent negative culture . her foley will be discontinued at discharge and she will continue home straight catheterizations given her post-void residual of 200 cc on admission per the visiting nurse . disposition : discharge medications : multivitamins one tablet p.o. q.d. , halcion 0.l25 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. ( forty tablets , no refills ) , and acthar 40 units intramuscularly q.d. times two days and then 20 units intramuscularly q.d. times three days . condition on discharge : stable . disposition is to home . follow-up care will be per dr. critche at the cockdownbayscot waredoun inmountsonente memorial and per dr. a or at the retelk county medical center with regard to the rys memorial hospital protocol . ________________________________ mj092/0660 a l. or , m.d. bi89 d : 08/21/90 batch : 2695 report : x9178r1 t : 08/25/90 dicatated by : trangca f. or , m.d. ou12

attending : grosrianne sisandlee jergjesc m.d. service : gms 1 medical service . discharge diagnosis : gi bleed . discharge condition : stable . hospital course : patient 's hospital course is as follows : patient is an 84-year-old male who was transferred from an outside hospital with a low hematocrit of 21 and with guaiac-positive stool . the day prior to admission , he experienced dyspnea on exertion , and on the day of admission he collapsed and complained of substantial weakness . he denied any melana , any hematemesis , nausea or vomiting . he was taken to an outside hospital at the time at which time it was found that his hematocrit was 21 , blood pressure 90/60 , and his inr was 3.3 . of note , he is anti-coagulated for an artificial heart valve . he was at that point given 1 unit of packed red blood cells . on further questioning , the patient reported that he started to feel " different " several days ago with slowing and difficult ambulation progressing to complete inability to ambulate . he was also short of breath with ambulation , but he does have baseline shortness of breath with exertion . he denied any chest pain , dysuria , loss of consciousness , fevers , chills or any history of myocardial infarction . patient was last admitted to padrugmoff hospital with a hematocrit of 24.5 , and was asymptomatic prior to admission . at that time , he had guaiac-positive and had a small bowel follow through which was negative . he was transfused 4 units during that admission and discharged with a hematocrit of 34 on vitamin c and iron sulfate . exam on arrival in the lo hospital emergency room : on arrival at the lo hospital emergency room : he was found to have a temperature of 97.4 , heart rate 65 , pressure 107/52 , respiratory rate 22 and saturating 100% on 2 l of a nasal cannula . general exam at the time was notable for pale mucous membranes , left lateral eye deviation , clear lungs , 2/6 holosystolic murmur , best heard at the apex , abdomen was mildly distended but was soft and nontender and his extremities were without edema and skin without any rashes . past medical history : is as follows : history of coronary artery disease with status post two-vessel cabg in 1986 , also he was treated for congestive heart failure , hypertension , aortic valve replacement , and mitral valve replacement with st. jude 's valve in 09/2001 , atrial fibrillation , history of prior gi bleed requiring blood transfusions during which he also had a colonoscopy on 05/2003 which demonstrated no neoplasia and scattered diverticuli . the patient also , following his first gi bleed , had an eeg done in 07/2003 which showed gastritis with oozing and evidence of a recent bleed . allergies : no known drug allergies . medications : included lasix , lopressor , coumadin , diovan , torsemide , flomax , protonix , senekot , potassium , vitamin c , iron , and a multivitamin . social history : notable for no tobacco , no alcohol . he has a wife with alzheimer 's who lives in a skilled-nursing facility . laboratory data : notable for a bun and creatinine of 78 , 1.7 ; for a sodium , potassium 139 and 3.6 ; chloride and bicarb 108 , 21 . white count 7 , hematocrit 24.2 , platelet count was 183 . his inr was also 3.4 . ptt was 55 . his ekg was notable for right bundle branch block , left axis deviation , but was in sinus rhythm . his ua had 10-17 white blood cells ; trace leukocyte esterase hyaline casts numbering 60-70 . his chest x-ray was notable for clear lungs with no edema or infiltrates and small bilateral effusions . other notalbe labs : patient was found to have a troponin of 0.71 on admission with a ck of 46 and ckmb of 3.4 . assessment : at that time , it was felt that the patient was likely having a repeat gi bleed and while he was hemodynamically stable , he had evidently lost a substantial amount of blood . hospital course : 1. gi : patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells overnight , the first night after admission and his hematocrit bumped up appropriately . he remained hemodynamically stable throughout his admission . he was continued on a proton pump inhibitor and on iron sulfate and vitamin c . his coumadin was held at the time given the bleeding , even though it was important to keep his inr 2.5-3.5 , given his artificial valve it was felt that the risk of continued bleeding was to great to continue the coumadin . he was subsequently seen by the gi team who performed an upper endoscopy which demonstrated the following : in the esophagus , there was a small hiatal hernia and in the stomach there is evidence of erosive gastritis of the body of the stomach and the antrum , the mucous appeared edematous . a small polyp was found in the fundus which stigmata of old bleeding ; an endoclip was applied to this . another polyp was found in the antrum and cold biopsies were obtained there . in the duodenum , a small avm was noted in the second portion of the duodenum and was cauterized . the biopsy subsequently demonstrated a hyperplastic polyp with acute and chronic inflammation and erosion and reactive epithelial changes but no dysplasia . also of note , prior to the upper endoscopy , the patient received fresh frozen plasma to reverse his anticoagulation . patient remained hemodynamically stable during and after the upper endoscopy and his hematocrit remained above 30 following this until the point of discharge . his last recorded hematocrit on discharge was 31.3 . his last bun and creatinine were 42 and 1.5 with an inr of 2.5 . consideration was given to performing a repeat colonoscopy . this was discussed with the gi service who felt that this was not necessary given the recent colonoscopy that he had had in 05/2003 . 2. cardiovascular : a : ischemia : patient 's troponin bump was found to be likely to demand ischemia in the setting of his gi bleed , it was not felt that he was having acute coronary syndrome . on discharge , he was continued on his aspirin , simvastatin and his lopressor which was initially held , and subsequently restarted . b : rhythm : patient continued to be in a-fib. throughout the admission and was restarted on his coumadin concurrently with heparin . heparin was subsequently dcd once his inr reached a therapeutic level between 2.5-3.5 . his last reported inr on discharge was 2.5 . c : valves : patient had , as noted above , his anticoagulation was initially reversed despite his having artificial valves . however , his coumadin was subsequently restarted and he achieved therapeutic inr levels before discharge . d : pump : patient , during this hospital course , became hypervolemic likely due to his diuretics being held and due to his receiving blood products . he was diuresed initially with one dose of lasix and subsequently with one dose of torsemide after it was discovered that he developed thrombocytopenia on a prior admission in reaction to lasix . he subsequently was diuresed to a euvolemic state . of note , he did not become thrombocytopenic on this admission . disposition : was discharged on 11/16/2003 in stable condition with the last recorded hematocrit of 31.3 . he was asked to continue on his nexium , iron and vitamin c and was continued on his other home medications . discharge medications : his final medications on discharge were as follows : aspirin 325 , he was restarted on a ppi , also on iron , vitamin c , lopressor 12.5 b.i.d . of note , this was at a decreased dose compared to that which he came in on , coumadin 7.5 , mg , torsemide 100 q.d. , sucralfate , simvastatin , diovan . condition on discharge : he was discharged in stable condition with instructions to follow up with his pcp as well as to follow up with the anticoagulation clinic and dr. gilbert . escription document : 4-9918752 ieehttd tel dictated by : netpeake , shirlh attending : jergjesc , grosrianne sisandlee dictation id 4535172 d : 12/22/03 t : 12/22/03

history of present illness : mr. he is a 77 year old male with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung . the initial presentation was the orifice of the right upper lobe with mediastinoscopy positive for subcarinal lymph node . he received 6,000 rads to his mediastinum with external beam . subsequently , he returned to goo where he received another 3,000 rads via an endobronchial catheter , apparently due to recurrence . over the pat three to four weeks , he started having increased dyspnea and noted wheezing . a bronchoscopy showed protrusion of the tumor into the right main stem bronchus with a positive needle biopsy , washings and brushings for squamous cell carcinoma . a computerized tomography scan showed a large subcarinal mass . past medical history : his past medical history was significant for malignant bladder tumor in 1991 . physical examination : on physical examination , mr. he had very marked inspiratory and expiratory stridor . there were no nodes present . the breath sounds were somewhat decreased through both lung fields . his cardiac examination did not show any murmur , gallop , or cardiomegaly . there was no hepatosplenomegaly , and no peripheral edema . hospital course : a bronchoscopy with the intention of coring out tumor was carried out by dr. reg he , but all the tumor was extrinsic to the airway and he was unable to relieve the obstruction . the tumor now involves the trachea as well as the right main bronchus . his major complaint was of persistent severe coughing and secretions . ultimately , only codeine at 30 mg q6h controlled him and this was very affective . inhalers provide only mild relief . he is aware of his prognosis . the patient was also seen by dr. lenchermoi fyfesaul of the oncology service who did not feel that chemotherapy had anything of promise to offer . mr. he is an anxious man , but very pleasant . he and his family understand his prognosis . lenni e. cea , m.d. tr : xp / bmot dd : 3-11-97 td : 03/13/94 cc : 
principal diagnosis : pulmonary edema . associated diagnosis : congestive heart failure , coronary artery disease , mediastinal mass , inferior myocardial infarction , bronchiectasis . adverse drug reactions : none . clinical infections : none . principal procedure : cardiac catheterization . associated procedures : vq scan , lower extremities noninvasive doppler studies and overnight oximetry saturation monitoring . history of present illness : mr. state is an 81-year-old man with a history of restrictive and obstructive lung disease , dilated cardiomyopathy , inferior myocardial infarction , and anterior mediastinal masses admitted with acute onset of pulmonary edema . in the setting of inadvertently decreasing lasix from 80 mg. po 40 mg. a day mr. state had sudden onset dyspnea after approximate day and a half prodrome culminating in severe dyspnea . upon arrival in the emergency room mr. state 's saturations were in the mid 80s and he was promptly rendered more comfortable with high flow oxygen , morphine , and nitrates and intravenous lasix . chest x-ray was relatively unrevealing for interstitial or alveolar edema and with clinical improvement ensued with the immediate therapy in the emergency room as noted . the patient denied angina , syncope , preceding worsening orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations , chest pain , hematemesis or melena . past medical history : is notable for an inferior myocardial infarction , restrictive and obstructive lung disease with an fev1 of .9 and fvc of 1.34 and a moderate at best response to bronchodilators , and a negative sestamibi scan in may , 1999 apart from a severe fixed inferolateral defect , systolic dysfunction with recent echocardiography revealing an lvid of 62 mm. and ejection fraction of 28 percent , moderate mitral regurgitation and mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 33 and a mean gradient of 19 and a valve area of 1.4 cm. squared . in addition , mr. state has an anterior mediastinal mass 2x2x1.7 cm. by recent computerized tomography scan without surrounding or adjacent adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease apart from bronchiectasis . his cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ana , negative spep , upep and benz-jones proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative . the patient lives on quelene with his wife . he is a non-smoker and drinks rare alcohol . physical examination : the patient was a very pleasant man who appeared his stated age . blood pressure was 155/60 , heart rate 70 with occasional premature ventricular contractions , respirations 14 . mr. state was dyspneic speaking in short sentences initially on high flow oxygen . jugular venous pressure was 8 with a brisk inspiratory descent . there was no thyromegaly . carotids were 2+ . breath sounds were decreased at the bases only with distant heart sounds and a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur consistent with aortic stenosis with gallavardin like radiation to the apex . abdomen : soft , nontender with hepatosplenomegaly , or hepatojugular reflex , bruits or pulsations . there was no rash and no edema and the neurological examination was non-focal . laboratory data : notable for a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.6 , bun 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 104 , hematocrit 42 , white count 8.7 , platelet count 235 and a pt of 12.9 seconds . the urinalysis was negative . the troponin i was less than .4 and the creatine kinase was 114 . chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases . the electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations . after a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent . prior to catheterization a vq scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for pe with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung . subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and d-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent . it was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto . coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries . after a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute . based upon these findings it was felt that mr. state most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state . in hospital he was seen by both speech therapy , physical therapy , and the uspend harmemewood medical center congestive heart failure nurse practitioner program . his isordil was increased in hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 . future adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures . at a goal weight of 142 pounds , mr. state 's filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home . the patient will be followed by dr. state within a week of discharge and by nieie naebrand freierm of the dyathenslycha medical center . medications on discharge : imdur 120 mg. po q.d. captopril 100mg. po t.i.d. lasix 80 mg. po q.d. potassium chloride 40 meq. po q.d. coreg

principal diagnosis : chronic myelomonocytic leukemia , without remission , atrial fibrillation , chronic airway obstruction , hypopotassemia , cellulitis , orbital hemorrhage , protein calorie malnutrition , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , pulmonary hemorrhage / pneumonia , hyperglycemia , renal insufficiency , hyperuricemia , hypophosphatemia . history of present illness : this 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least november 1993 , while he was living in aersing rocuch sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea . apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . he came to this country in late december 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up . he had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea . he became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness . past medical history : significant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an italian variation of digoxin , and amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ace inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler . other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol . he also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously . physical examination : he was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 . he had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae . there were bibasilar rales with some wheezing . he had no cardiac murmur . his abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender . the neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . laboratory data : included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta 's , 3 nucleated red blood cells . there were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes . the platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 . his prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal . his uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his ldh was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , bun and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 . a computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest x-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses . there was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions . an electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days . he did spike a fever and began ancef and gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this . he also tried amicar and continued on low dose prednisone . his headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea . there was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia . transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen . amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently . a bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his cmml to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous cystosine arabinoside and 6-thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions . he was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on allopurinol . the renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his gentamicin . the family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection . he was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose morphine drip which made him much more comfortable . they agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present . no autopsy was obtained . lenni breutzoln , m.d. tr : lj / bmot dd : 3/12/94 td : 03/13/94 cc : dr. ca shuff , fih oregon dr. ille kote

normal . abdomen - normal . there was no hsm . extremities - her left arm was very swollen . it was tested with no voluntary movement except at the finger tips . there was no edema elsewhere in her extremities , only the left arm . neuro - the patient was oriented to place , but had difficulty with recent memory . she also had mild weakness in the left extremities , both upper and lower . cranial nerves ii - xii were grossly intact . toes were downgoing . laboratory data : of note - na 133 , k 4 , wbc 8.82 , hematocrit 35.1 , platelets 229 . pt 13.8 with an inr of 1.3 , ptt 25.5 , total protein was 6.2 , albumin 3.4 , globulin of 2.8 , calcium of 9.1 , phos 2.7 , mag 2.1 , urea 3.7 . alt was elevated at 240 , ast 85 , ldh 305 , alk phos 85 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , direct bili was .8 . cholesterol 188 , triglyceride was 127 . ua - trace protein , trace ketones , positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1+ bacteria . chest x-ray - showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia . in summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell ca , status post chemotherapy with cmsap and pvsc and xrt who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall . the keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea . when she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with iv antibiotics . so she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her . also at the time of admission we were also considering palliative taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined . she refused the taxol therapy so that was not done . another major issue with this patient was pain control . she had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion . so pain control was a big issue so she was on ms contin and msir at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management . one of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at c6-c7 interface on 1-6-94 . after that the patient had minimal relief of pain . however , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her . so accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up . she is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch . she is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours . we can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain . other things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead ct for her on the 8th of january because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking . we went ahead and got a head ct scanand it showed no enhancing lesions . in addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that . that has been stable . the patient on january 13 became hyponatremic . her sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 . a renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as siadh . we proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it . we had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction . in addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient 's sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116. so that has really improved . we suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day . on the 14th of january , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with hampton 's hump . also a vq scan obtained the next day showed high probability for pe . so we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s. her inr is 2.3 . we want her inr to remain between 2 and 3 . so if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night . however , we would leave it at 2.5 for now . other major issues - as a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also . we put her on nifedipine ir , sl and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol . so on discharge she is on atenolol 100 . if needed to you can give her some nifedipine sl to decrease her blood pressure . the patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so i think that fluid restriction should help with that . she is also a little dry . the patient is on oxygen . ever since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen . she was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters . we would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well . the complications that i have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure . disposition : discharge medications - baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d. , mvi one tablet p.o. q.d. , mycostatin powder tp q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d. condition on discharge : fair . she remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema . she is to go to the necsoncardel medical center for more chronic care . follow-up is with dr. wedleung in the hem / onc in two weeks . the appointment has already been made . the patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain primarily and her difficulty breathing . dictated by : jeabriharl figefreiermfothgrendcajaque , m.d. attending : la inemacistin prontmandes , m.d. hd45 sy882/1177 batch : 020 index no. yjqi3j9vu6 d : 01/25/94 t : 01/25/94 
principal diagnosis : ependymoma involving the conus medullaris of the spinal cord . principal procedure : january 26 , 1994 , intradural microsurgical exploration and biopsy of invasive intramedullary conus tumor . doctors discharge orders : the patient is to rest . he was given prescriptions for decadron with a decadron taper and he was given an out patient appointment to see dr. niste addison in the radiation medicine service to begin out patient radiotherapy . he was told to have his sutures removed in seven to ten days , and told to call the office if problems or questions arose . he was also given a prescription for percocet as needed for pain . history of present illness : this twenty-six year old male was admitted to the ph university of medical center on january 26 , 1994 to undergo surgical exploration of a conus tumor . he had previously been evaluated for back pain and found to have a conus tumor on magnetic resonance imaging study . hospital course : following the standard preoperative evaluation , he was taken to the operating room and underwent a laminectomy t11 , t12 , and l1 and intradural microsurgical exploration . at the time of surgery we found an invasive conus tumor emanating from the ventral portio of the conus and completely engulfing and encircling all of the ventral nerve roots . the procedure had been done with intraoperative monitoring , and every time we made an attempt to dissect tumor away from the nerve roots we achieved considerable stimulation of the lower extremity muscles . we felt that the way the tumor was invading and wrapped around all of the nerves and sharing a common blood supply with them , that it would not be possible to achieve any form of significant surgical decompression or removal of tumor without leading to a substantial neurological deficit . therefore , the operation was terminated by placing a large dural graft to provide intradural room with the idea that postoperatively the lesion would be treated with radiation therapy . the patient tolerated the procedure well . the postoperative course was without complication . pain was managed initially with an intravenous patient controlled analgesia system . the wound healed without difficulty and the drain was removed . the patient began to ambulate . his leg strength was noted to be identical to the way it had been prior to the surgery . because of his continued excellent progress , he was allowed to be discharged home on february 2 , 1994 . rashanemar s. addison , m.d. tr : np / bmot dd : 3-3-94 td : 03/04/94 cc : dr. rashanemar s. addison p9

rheumatoid fever as a child and a heart murmur noted but no further testing . she has used antibiotic prophylaxis since 1980 . in 1980 she had quadruple coronary artery bypass graft surgery by dr. elks at feargunwake otacaa community hospital and did well until 1988 when she had exertional angina and a positive stress test and found that three or four grafts were occluded . in october , 1989 , dr. no re-did her bypass operation . she had a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 2 . in 1993 she had a ddd pacemaker for complete heart block . she had exertional angina at that time . in november , 1997 she had a small myocardial infarction as was transferred to ona hospital where a cardiac catheterization showed a tight left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending stenosis , high grade saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 stenosis and patent obtuse marginal 2 graft . she had normal left ventricular function with apical tip akinesis . since that time she has continued to have exertional left chest burning , radiating to the left neck and arm , relieved by nitroglycerin . she was turned down for re-do surgery at that time and did not have a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty . because these symptoms have been increasing , particularly at cardiac rehabilitation , she was referred here . in may , 1998 she had an exercise tolerance test in which her heart rate went to 112 and her blood pressure fell to 95 systolic . she had diffuse ischemic st segment changes and increased lung uptake and a reversible anterior and lateral defect . she has had no syncope . her cardiac risk factors are hypertension and elevated cholesterol . she has a very strong family history of coronary artery disease with a mother , sister and brother dying of myocardial infarction . she is a remote cigarette smoker . she also has a history of lactose intolerance , peptic ulcer disease , with a remote gastrointestinal bleed and multiple ectopic pregnancies and mid term miscarriages . she has had a total abdominal hysterectomy . social history : she is a widow for 20 years and retired 18 years from palmci she lives alone . her son , nertland is nearby and he works at the em nysonken medical center on verville . they live in ohio . physical examination : she is a healthy appearing female , 5 foot 120 pounds . her blood pressure was 120/70 , pulse 60 and regular . neck veins are not distended . respiratory rate 12 . carotids : no bruits . lungs were clear . cardiac : 1/6 systolic ejection murmur . abdomen was benign . peripheral pulses intact . neurological examination non-focal . laboratory data : on admission , includes an electrocardiogram that shows ddd pacing . hematocrit 39 percent , white blood cell count 4500 , pt and ptt normal . sodium 140 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 105 , carbon dioxide 30 , bun 24 , creatinine 1.0 . hospital course and treatment : the patient was admitted to the cardiac catheterization laboratory . there , her pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure 44/17 . her left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with dyskinesis of the apex . she had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction . her native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was an obtuse marginal branch . the saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded . the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded . the saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with no significant stenosis , but there was an outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery . this was considered her culprit lesion . this was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft . in addition , it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs . her left internal mammary artery was also unused . it was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead . she would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing . this was intermittent . the p wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed . the patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker . it was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure . her pacemaker was set to a vvi mode which sensed appropriately . she was in sinus rhythm with most of the time . when her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker , she had significant angina . carotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable . the situation was reviewed with dr. niste graft . he felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction . for this reason , it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates . the situation was reviewed with dr. no of the pacemaker service . on august 20 , under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a cpi unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .15 mm. , which permitted appropriate atrial sensing . there was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads . it just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode . she tolerated this well . her medications were resumed . she ambulated without difficulty and was discharged to home to be followed medically for her coronary artery disease following two failed bypass graft procedure by dr. brendniungand

then , dr. thorebreutz took him to the operating room , where he had quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting . he had a left internal mammary artery graft of the lad , a single saphenous vein to the right coronary artery with 280 cc per minute flow , and a saphenous vein snake graft to the diagonal and circumflex with 150 cc per minute flow . a paraphimosis was noted and treated by dr. ryna jescdrig . after surgery he had a ongoing sinus tachycardia . he was able to be rapidly weaned and extubated . he had good hemodynamics . he had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats . his intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the surgical intensive care unit . he was seen in consultation by the nutrition service , who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus . on 08/05 it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous heparin and indeed , when heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal . therefore , he does have a thrombocytopenic reaction to heparin . he remained in normal sinus rhythm . he did have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , which were clinically stable . he had a right bundle branch block . he is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction , but he is clinically stable on ace inhibitors , digoxin , coumadin , and aspirin . therefore he was able to be discharged home . he understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin times and his arrhythmias ; these will be done in grovea co terburgperv portnew . achastha n. daizsmaellille , m.d. tr : ssx / bmot dd : 08-09-93 td : 08/10/93 cc : dr. thorebreutz , e 2

cause of death : cardiogenic shock . causative factors : including cardiomyopathy , aortic stenosis , status post aortic valve replacement , coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting with congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema . history of present illness : the patient is a 65 year old male who sustained a small myocardial infarction first in 1978 , with course thereafter including a coronary artery bypass graft by dr. wierst ______________at noughwell entanbon health in 1986 . in 1991 he presented with congestive heart failure and he underwent porcine aortic valve replacement . in the seven to eight months preceding admission , he developed recurrent angina with dyspnea on exertion . the patient was admitted for cardiac catheterization in early december , 1993 . past medical history : significant for vertebrobasilar insufficiency , bipolar mood disorder , and hypercholesterolemia , as well as some baseline renal insufficiency . medications on admission : procardia sustained release 60 mg. po q.day , digoxin .25 mg. po q.day , lasix 30 mg. ( interval unspecified ) , prozac 40 mg. po q.day , lovestatin 20 mg. po bid , aspirin q. day and supplemental potassium . physical examination : remarkable for an oriented , alert male in no acute distress with decreased breath sounds at the right base consistent with effusion and a 3/6 systolic murmur consistent with aortic stenosis . his pulse exam was intact . cardiac catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left-sided filling pressures at rest , with pulmonary hypertension and normal cardiac index . there was severe aortic stenosis of 70 millimeter peak gradient , native three vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery graft to the left circumflex , dissection of the left main was induced by the catheter tip . a patent right internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and diagonal was noted , and a patent saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery was present . also of note , pulmonary edema was induced by dye and anxiety and treated with lasix , morphine , oxygen and nitroglycerin . post-procedure he was admitted to the ccu because of the history of left main dissection . he remained hemodynamically stable but of note , would not tolerate a transesophageal echo because of anxiety-he would not swallow the probe . transthoracic echo demonstrated gradients of 100 peak and 65 mean across the aortic valve and there was mild aortic insufficiency and ejection fraction was noted to be 18% with global hypokinesis . the next several days were remarkable for events in which the patient was quite agitated and was evaluated by psychiatry and treated with ativan . the patient was then evaluated by cardiac surgery for probable re-do aortic valve replacement and possible re-do coronary artery bypass grafting . in the course of preoperative workup , mr. has was evaluated completely by psychiatry with diagnoses including underlying chronic depression well-controlled on prozac , underlying organ brain vulnerability of unclear etiology , possibly microvascular infarct , acute paranoid and belligerent behavior , possibly due to medications . on december 12 the patient underwent surgery , including a re-do aortic valve replacement with # 25 st. jude and re-do coronary artery bypass grafting times one ; saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery as a veno-venous jump graft . the total bypass time : 2 hours 25 minutes . total crossclamp time : 1 hour and 48 minutes . the patient was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit postoperatively with stable hemodynamics on lidocaine at one , dobutamine at 200 and nipride . the patient was extubated by postoperative day # 1 but was noted to be relatively hypoxemic with high oxygen requirement . chest x-ray demonstrating pulmonary edema . aggressive diuresis was undertaken and the patient responded , albeit sluggishly . in addition , he remained agitated . this was attributed to mild hypoxia and / or his underlying psychiatric diagnoses and he was treated with haldol appropriately . on day # 2 the patient continued to diurese and this was maintained with the lasix/ mannitol infusion . his urine output remained at 150 to 200 cc. an hour . despite this , his chest x-ray continued to show severe pulmonary edema and the clinical picture correlated . he required anti-hypertensive therapy initially with nipride which was changed to hydralazine to avoid shunting . he received several units of packed red blood cells to increase his hematocrit and oncotic pressure . very early in the morning on postoperative day # 3 , the patient became acutely hypoxic after several hours of marginal oxygenation with respiratory rates in the thirties and the patient was urgently intubated , without complication . with positive pressure ventilation and continued diuresis , his arterial blood gases improved . throughout this he remained hemodynamically stable . exception was a ten beat run of ventricular tachycardia which was thought to be ischemic in origin and treated with nitrates and lidocaine . his chest x-ray blossomed to demonstrate pulmonary infiltrate and the patient began to produce sputum . infectious disease consultation was obtained for evaluation of his purulent sputum and the patient was covered with vancomycin , ceftazidime and gentamicin . cardiology evaluation commented on the patient 's increasing ventricular ectopy and suggested that these were due to an r and t phenomenon from his pacer in the setting of prolonged qt interval . consequently his pronestyl was discontinued . in addition , the patient was given magnesium to bring his level above 2 . on the evening of the 18th , the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable , although his oxygenation was clearly deteriorating and more marginal . on 60% fio2 his po2 was 63 . it was increased to 65% with po2 of 81 . at approximately 7:50 a.m. , house officer was called to the room for blood pressure of 70/40 with falling oxygen saturations . the patient was immediately given 400 mg. of calcium chloride i.v. push and ventilator disconnected and the patient manually ventilated . within one minute , the patient lost his blood pressure and cpr was initiated and code was called . the patient initially continued to have rhythm consistent with emv and he was bolused with levophed and given some volume while compressions continued . the patient 's prothrombin time had been 23 early the same morning and tamponade was considered and thoracotomy instruments obtained . the chest was opened partially and through sub-xyphoid area it was determined that there was no evidence of tamponade . compressions were continued and adequate pulse was felt and arterial blood gases demonstrated adequate oxygenation and perfusion . the patient 's rhythm degenerated to ventricular tachycardia and he was shocked , initially without response but after several doses of epinephine , one-half mg. of atropine and a bolus of lidocaine we were able to obtain a blood pressure and rhythm only briefly , and quickly deteriorated back to ventricular fibrillation . further attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and the patient was pronounced dead at 8:30 a.m. the family has been notified and autopsy consent has been obtained . lenni breutzoln , m.d. tr : bp / bmot dd : 12/17/93 td : 12/18/93 cc : g hemp , m.d. taarnna has , m.d.

the patient was noted to have nausea and a marked increase in her mild baseline confusion of several years duration . she was transferred to a facility at atl mil , maryland in oakwest on 01/10/92 with a headache , nausea and worsening confusion as well as incomprehensible speech . she was not able to follow commands and had a low grade temperature with a question of a right facial droop . she was then transferred to box memorial hospital nursing home where a lumbar puncture revealed a few red blood cells and white blood cells but also showed marked xanthochromia . she did not reveal any

1952 . right heart biopsy in 1990 which was benign . family history : was noncontributory . medications on transfer : included percocet , tenormin , xanax , mevacor and with a history of of calan , ornade and lasix . allergies : there were no known drug allergies . habits : did not include tobacco or alcohol ingestion . physical examination : on physical examination on admission the patient was somnolent but conversant , oriented x 1 only . chest was clear . heart had regular rate and rhythm . neck was supple without mass or bruits . the abdomen was soft and nontender . calves were nontender . on neuro exam the patient was somnolent but readily arousable to conversation . she looked at the examiner and carried an appropriate conversation but only for seconds at a time . her face was strong and symmetric . she felt pin prick and light touch bilaterally to the face symmetrically . her extra ocular movements were full without nystagmus . she sees light only od. which is chronic . she reads large print os. her tongue was midline and her palate elevated symmetrically . she could not maintain her arms long enough to detect drift . she also lifted both legs and flexes at the knees . her grip is 5/5 bilaterally . ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion were 5/5 bilaterally . laboratory data : on admission her labs. were notable for a hematocrit of 41.9 , white blood count 11.1 , mcv 87 , sodium 142 , potassium 3.0 , chloride 101 , bicarb. 29.3 , bun 13 , creatinine 0.9 and sugar 134 . a head ct performed on 01/10/92 revealed no cerebrovascular accident and no evidence of acute blood . mra / mri revealed a left internal carotid artery aneurysm about 7 mm. in width . hospital course : the patient was admitted to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital where a four vessel cerebral angiogram was performed on 01/13/92 . this revealed a lobulated aneurysm at the p. comm. origin on the left . this was a left internal carotid artery aneurysm . the internal carotid arteries and middle cerebral artery showed irregularity of caliber probably due to atherosclerosis . after much discussion , endovascular treatment with gd coils were recommended . the patient underwent coiling on 01/14/92 . this showed that 60-70% of the distal aneurysm was obliterated by the coils . one coil protruded into the lumen of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm . it was thought that the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage was low but still substantial from the untreated proximal lobe . also the risk of ischemia or infarct from the internal carotid artery coil could lead to thromboembolism . therefore the lowest overall risk was thought to be a craniotomy to obliterate the aneurysm and possibly remove the protruding coil . therefore after discussion in detail with sister rora dose , a left pterional craniotomy was performed on 01/15/92 . at this time it was noted that the left internal carotid artery aneurysm was mostly within the cavernous sinus and the extracavernous portion was extremely atherosclerotic . therefore no clip was possible and the patient underwent a muslin wrapping of the aneurysm . the patient postoperatively was able to open her eyes to voice and name . her pupils were equal and reactive and she was able to localize with the left upper extremity as well as raise the right upper extremity above the bed . her consciousness as well as her strength improved gradually and the patient was referred for rehabilitation at a chronic care center . discharge diagnosis : subarachnoid hemorrhage and left internal carotid artery aneurysm . procedures : on 01/13/92 four vessel cerebral angiogram . 01/14/92 embolization of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm . 01/15/92 left pterional craniotomy for left internal carotid artery aneurysm with exploration and muslin wrap of the aneurysm . complications : there were no noted complications . medications on discharge : include heparin 5000 units sq. b.i.d. , mom 30 cc.

myocardial infarction was ruled out by serial ck 's . the patient 's ck's were 233 , 198 and 132 . electrophoresis of the a set revealed no mb's . the patient 's ekg did not evolve . the patient has a long history of hypertension which has not been treated . during this admission , she was started on nifedipine for control of her blood pressure . gi : the patient presented with diffuse abdominal pain which was more pronounced in the left lower quadrant , nausea and vomiting . the differential diagnosis for this was felt to be a viral gastroenteritis , diverticulitis , degenerating fibroid , ovarian torsion and pelvic inflammatory disease . although the patient had cervical motion tenderness on admission physical exam , the gynecology service felt that the pelvic inflammatory disease was an unlikely diagnosis in this setting because the patient has had a tubal ligation in the past . the patient had an abdominal and pelvic ct scan at which time the ovaries were identified and were felt to be unremarkable . additionally , the uterus itself was felt to be normal . no diverticula were seen on the ct scan and no abscess was seen . after receiving 24 hours of iv fluids and hydration , the patient 's abdominal symptoms spontaneously resolved . she was taking po 's very well and had no further episodes of nausea , vomiting or emesis . at the time of discharge , she still had mild left lower quadrant pain on deep palpation only . infectious disease : at the time of admisison , the patient was afebrile and did not have a leukocytosis . however , blood cultures were drawn on admission . the patient had a total of four sets of blood cultures drawn . one set of blood cultures grew out group b strep and staph epi . as the patient was afebrile and had a normal white blood cell count , it was suspected that these cultures results were most likely a contaminant . two additional sets of blood cultures were drawn and the patient was empirically started on vancomycin and flagyl . after 48 hours , all other blood cultures remained negative and the patient continued to be afebrile . the antibiotics were discontinued , she was observed and remained afebrile . gynecologic : the patient had perimenopausal symptoms at the time of admission with hot flashes and irregular menstrual cycles . a fsh level was drawn and is pending at the time of dictation . the gynecology service would like to have follow-up with the patient for routine gynecologic exam , pap smear and estrogen replacement counseling in approximately three months . social : while in house , the patient was seen by social services . apparently , the patient lives alone and is without employment . she has no medical insurance . it was discussed that the patient should see the social service in outpatient kingsec li hospital . exercise treadmill : prior to discharge , the patient underwent ett . she exercised for three minutes and 40 seconds on the standard bruce protocol and achieved a peak heart rate of 138 and a peak blood pressure of 145/100 . this test was stopped because of leg and back pain . impression was that the study showed no evidence of ischemia . history of syphilis : the patient was treated for syphilis in the 1970's . rpr during this admission was reactive . the rpr titer itself was pending at the time of dictation . because of the positive rpr titer , fta was automatically sent off . however , the usefulness of the fta is questionable . the patient should have a follow-up of her rpr titer . disposition : medications : on discharge included procardia xl , 90 mg po q a.m . the patient was discharged home in stable condition . the patient will have follow-up in the kingsec li hospital with dr. boop on 12/10/92 . kv968/1032 ayan no , m.d. xa4 d : 11/28/92

principal diagnosis : coronary artery disease . associated diagnosis : ischemic cardiomyopathy , orthotopic heart transplantation , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , coronary graft disease , medical noncompliance . principal procedure : cardiac echocardiogram . other procedures : none . history of present illness : mr. vessels is a 49-year-old man status post orthotopic heart transplantation in 1991 at dautenorwe stuart erec hillpa of hospital who is admitted with dyspnea and severe heart failure . mr. vessels 's postoperative course has been marked by cmv infection , hypertension , poorly controlled lipids , peripheral vascular disease , and chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 1.8 or so . recently he had documented coronary angiography based on a catheterization performed in january 1996 with moderate to diffuse atherosclerosis . a repeat angiogram performed a year later showed marked progression of coronary allograft disease . a biopsy at that time revealed grade 1b rejection with endothelialitis and eosinophils . he was treated with pulsed iv steroids and imuran , was augmented with mycophenolate mofetil . chest x-ray showed cariogenic pulmonary edema and he was faring poorly . prior to admission he was seen approximately 1 week in the office with mild congestive heart failure . an echocardiogram then revealed an ejection fraction of 40% and an endomyocardial biopsy revealed no ejection . past medical history : notable for coronary artery disease , coronary allograft vasculopathy , hyperlipidemia , peripheral vascular disease , cmv infection , hypertension , depression , and tricuspid regurgitation . examination revealed a tired , fatigued man with cool extremities . his blood pressure is 130/80 and heart rate was 100. jugular venous pressure was increasing . carotids were 2+ . crackles were increased 1/4 of the way up . there was a left ventricular heave and an s3 galop . the abdomen was soft and nontender with a palpable liver edge and the pulses were diminished . laboratory data : revealed a sodium 136 , potassium 4.5 , bun 47 , creatinine 2.4 , glucose 136. hematocrit 40% . the electrocardiogram revealed poor r wave progression and marked decrease in all volts . chest x-ray revealed prominent pulmonary vessels and enlarged heart . hospital course and treatment : the patient was admitted to the hospital via the emergency room where a bedside echocardiogram was performed . the echocardiogram revealed no pericardial effusion , an ejection fraction of 30% and worsening systolic dysfunction . hydrocortisone was given 1 g in an attempt to reverse what was thought to be aggressive coronary allograft vasculopathy . the patient diuresed and responded to lasix 100 mg administered in the emergency room and was admitted to a monitored bed . at 4:30 am the following morning the patient was found in cardiac arrest . despite intravenous fluids , intravenous epinephrine , and multiple attempts at defibrillation , the patient was unable to be resuscitated . upon arrival of the covering access physician the patient was being ventilated mechanically and cpr was being performed . the rhythm revealed sinus tachycardia with no palpable or measurable blood pressure . there were also runs of ventricular tachycardia which generated into ventricular fibrillation that was refractory to multiple cardioversions . a pericardiocentesis was attempted with no yield of pericardial fluid . a transvenous pacing wire was attempted and a pacing rhythm was obtained but with no palpable blood pressure . in total , the patient was defibrillated 10 times , given 5 courses of intravenous epinephrine , one course of intravenous atropine and intravenous calcium x 1 in addition to an amp of bicarbonate . the resuscitation efforts were discontinued at 4:15 am and were begun at 3:38 am . the patient was pronounced dead . patient 's mother was informed by dr. vessels . an autopsy permission was granted . doctor 's discharge orders : none . aka mam , m.d. tr : ok dd : 05/14/97 td : 05/17/97 9:40 a cc : aka g mam , m.d. 
principal diagnosis : acute myocardial infarction . associated diagnosis : urinary tract infection , congestive heart failure , parkinson 's disease , chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage , history prostate cancer . history of present illness : the patient presented to ph university of medical center with a fever . the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of parkinson 's disease x 's 18 years , prostate cancer , urinary incontinence and recent subdurals after fall . he reports lower abdominal pain x's 2 days . of note , he is a very poor historian given his difficulty speaking and inability to write from his parkinson 's disease . his wife noted him to be restless on the day of admission , felt warm , temperature to 102.5 . they went to a local hospital where he was found to have a temperature of 102.4 and blood cultures were done and he was transferred to ph university of medical center for admission . he was recently started on a texas catheter for urinary incontinence at home . he has no symptoms of shortness of breath , cough , diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , choking on food , no new medications . past medical history : as above . medications ; on admission were eldepryl , artane , prilodol , sinemet and opuputine . allergies : he had no known drug allergies . hospital course and treatment : the patient was admitted and started on ampingent intravenously . there was a question of aspiration pneumonia so he was switched from ampicillin pen-g to aspiration pneumonia . he was continued on his parkinson 's medications . a head ct was scheduled to rule out interval increase in subdurals . head ct results show full bilateral acute hemorrhage in his subdural hematomas , now with slight midline shift . dr. factor agreed he would review the cts and follow the patient while in house . he was seen by urology , who suggested to leave the catheter in for now in the setting of doubt ms . he was seen by neuro , who felt that the subdural hemorrhages should be followed and treated conservatively as well as precautions for fall and no further intervention was warranted given risk of re-bleed which is quite high with his atrophic changes . the patient 's mental status improved greatly after the onset of intravenous antibiotics , doing much better , was much more awake and alert and the plan was to possibly send him home on po antibiotics and full arnsperni health services . bedside swallow test was done which showed him to have some aspiration . he did have some recurrent fevers and his intravenous antibiotic were continued . thus , he was considered ready for discharge . he again became much more somnolent , there was a question whether he had re-aspirated . he again was becoming increasing febrile and somnolent while the patient was awaiting a chest x-ray and further evaluation . he was switched over the clinda and gentamicin for his aspiration pneumonia and again his mental status improved . on 8/10/97 , the patient became unresponsive and apneic . brachial consult was obtained and the patient was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit . he was found to be profoundly hypoxic with sats down to 60% on 100% facemask . he was hypotensive into the 80s . an electrocardiogram showed evolving inferior q wave with increased st segment and left anterior st depressions . rv leads were negative for st elevation . a chest x-ray showed marked congestive heart failure with increased heart size . a portable echo showed no pericardial effusion and his left ventricle was severely diffusely hypokinetic with septal dyskinesis . anterior and inferior akinesis , apical akinesis to the posterior lateral wall moved slightly . he had about 20% mild mitral regurgitation . the right ventricle was markedly dilated with a kinetic free wall and very decreased function in a marked incomplete closure of the tricuspid valve with wide open tricuspid regurgitation . he was transferred to the intensive care unit for his acute myocardial infarction with very likely multi-vessel disease with concominent left anterior descending severe stenosis or likely left anterior descending with collateral circulation from that occluded right coronary artery . the patient was also evaluated by neurosurgery , given the difficult situation , the patient was not a candidate for streptokinase or tpa given his chronic subdurals with a recent new bleed . he was evaluated by neurosurgery , who felt that if heparin could be avoided , that would be best . he was treated conservatively with intubation , control of heart rate and on dobutamine for pressure support . he was diuresed with lasix and diuril and was oxygenating fairly well while intubated . he surprisingly made it through the next 24 hours . he was dynamically stable on his dobutamine with improved oxygenation . the patient continued fairly stable while intubated . two days after the myocardial infarction he continued with stable blood pressure on a very small amount of dobutamine . he had diuresed very well with good oxygenation . his neurostatus was indeterminate given his sedation on the ventilatory . discussions with the family were ongoing regarding do not resuscitate and long term plan given his comorbidities . they were waiting appropriately for some information from the repeat echo after his myocardial infarction . an echo showed that there was not much improvement in cardiac function , both right or left ventriculus . they did at that time decide to make him do not resuscitate , but were interested in continuing supportive care to see how much he would bounce back . the repeat echo showed no improvement in left ventricle or right ventricle function with marked akinesis of many walls . the lack of meaningful recovery was much less likely . discussions were had with the family regarding withdrawal of ventilator support , which they very appropriately decided on given the low possibility of any meaningful recovery . he was extubated successfully and was breathing comfortably on his own . the patient was transferred back to the medical floor in stable , but very guarded condition . no further blood draws were done . the patient was made comfortable on a low dose of intravenous morphine with sectioning to prevent further aspiration . comfort measures continued until the day 8/19/97 , where mr. koteleebdils was found to be pulseless , without respirations . he was declared dead at 7:15 a.m. on 8/19/97 . the family and the attending physician were notified . laure mediate , m.d. tr : lw dd : 10/22/97 td :

bronchiectasis . his cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ana , negative spep , upep and benz-jones proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative . the patient lives on ewi with his wife . he is a non-smoker and drinks rare alcohol . physical examination : the patient was a very pleasant man who appeared his stated age . blood pressure was 155/60 , heart rate 70 with occasional premature ventricular contractions , respirations 14 . mr. bridge was dyspneic speaking in short sentences initially on high flow oxygen . jugular venous pressure was 8 with a brisk inspiratory descent . there was no thyromegaly . carotids were 2+ . breath sounds were decreased at the bases only with distant heart sounds and a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur consistent with aortic stenosis with gallavardin like radiation to the apex . abdomen : soft , nontender with hepatosplenomegaly , or hepatojugular reflex , bruits or pulsations . there was no rash and no edema and the neurological examination was non-focal . laboratory data : notable for a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.6 , bun 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 104 , hematocrit 42 , white count 8.7 , platelet count 235 and a pt of 12.9 seconds . the urinalysis was negative . the troponin i was less than .4 and the creatine kinase was 114 . chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases . the electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations . after a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent . prior to catheterization a vq scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for pe with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung . subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and d-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent . it was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto . coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries . after a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute . based upon these findings it was felt that mr. bridge most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state . in hospital he was seen by both speech therapy , physical therapy , and the uspend harmemewood medical center congestive heart failure nurse practitioner program . his isordil was increased in hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 . future adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures . at a goal weight of 142 pounds , mr. bridge 's filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home . the patient will be followed by dr. fraction within a week of discharge and

senior living facility adjacent to friends . hospital course : 1 ) cardiovascular : the patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction . she remained on telemetry for greater than 48 hours which demonstrated no dysrhythmia during this time . the patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction with left ventricular hypertrophy and no significant valvular abnormalities . the patient was maintained on her aspirin and lasix . the patient 's diltiazem was stopped due to her increased blood pressure and was started on labetalol which was gradually titrated up to a target blood pressure of 160-170 systolic in her right arm . the patient also underwent an adenosine mibi stress test which showed only mild lateral ischemia . at this time , the patient 's presyncopal symptoms were not felt to be secondary to a cardiovascular etiology . 2 ) neurological / vascular : the discrepancy in the patient 's pulses and blood pressure was felt to be consistent with a subclavian artery stenosis . the patient underwent mri / mra of the head , neck and upper chest which demonstrated a proximal left subclavian artery stenosis , proximal to the take off of the left vertebral artery . the left vertebral artery had a decreased flow consistent with either native vessel disease or some degree of retrograde flow with subclavian steal phenomenon . the patient had patent carotids bilaterally on her neck mra . mri of the head demonstrated a small vessel disease and was likely an old right cerebellar infarct . the patient underwent non-invasive carotid ultrasounds which demonstrated no significant carotid disease . the patient was also noted to have antegrade flow in both of her vertebral arteries bilaterally . the results of these studies suggested that the patient 's symptoms were not due to subclavian steal phenomenon , and therefore , it was decided that the patient would not go further to angio and / or surgical or percutaneous intervention . a neurology consult was obtained and it was felt that the most valuable intervention that could be done for the patient 's intervascular disease would be adequate control of her blood pressure . 3 ) orthopedic : the patient suffered a fall at home with her initial event . outside hip films were obtained , but were not available for view . repeat hip films demonstrated a right sided pubic rami fracture , likely new . an orthopedics consult was obtained and the patient was encouraged to weight bear as tolerated with physical therapy assistance . a bone scan was also obtained to rule out an occult hip fracture which was negative . at the time of this dictation , the patient was able to bear weight with the assistance of physical therapy and a walker . plans were made for the patient to be discharged to dwardmegriff rehabilitation for rehabilitation of her rami fracture . 4 ) gastrointestinal : the patient had an episode of her described vertigo while lying in bed and on the monitor during which no dysrhythmia was noted . the patient also complained of frequent vomiting at least once a day , occasionally associated with ingestion of her medications , but sometimes associated with ambulation . the patient has a long-standing history of spontaneous emesis due to overwhelming stress or excitement . however , the patient reports emesis in the hospital more frequently . the patient 's emesis was noted to be bilious without evidence of new or old blood . the etiology of the patient 's nausea remained unclear as she demonstrated ability to keep down many of her meals which did not suggest an anatomical lesion of her gastrointestinal tract . the patient was started on meclizine on december 31 , 2000 for her nausea and vertigo . an attempt was also made to reduce the patient 's large number of medications and the patient 's os-cal , multivitamin , lasix and colace were discontinued . 5 ) infectious disease : the patient complained of some urinary incontinence and difficulty initiating urine on december 30 , 2000 . urinalysis demonstrated a likely urinary tract infection . the patient was started on levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q. day times seven days for a possible nosocomial urinary tract infection . the urine culture was pending at the time of this dictation . 6 ) fluids , electrolytes and nutrition : the patient had a mild increase in her bun and creatinine during her hospitalization which promptly returned to her baseline levels with intravenous fluids . the patient was encouraged to increase her p.o. intake . dictated by : bone a ,

principal diagnosis : thoracoabdominal aneurysm . associated diagnosis : hypertension . principal procedure : 2/17/94 : resection and grafting of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm . history : the patient is a 74 year old female who was involved in a motor vehicle accident on 11/18/93 at which time her workup revealed a large thoracoabdominal aneurysm at the eifro medical center which was evaluated with a chest x-ray and abdominal ct scan . at that time the patient denied any symptoms of aneurysmal pain and did not suffer significant injury from her motor vehicle accident . she was subsequently referred to dr. riode zetllille for evaluation and workup of her aneurysm . the patient underwent a thoracic abdominal arteriogram on 12/31/93 via a right femoral approach and she was noted to have a large descending aorta with tortuosity but no aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta . the patient was discharged after the procedure was performed and subsequently admitted in this hospitalization for elective resection . since the patient 's last admission she gives no history of chest or back pain and continues to be quite active . physical examination : on physical examination she is a well developed female in no distress . her head and neck examination is within normal limits . her lungs were clear to auscultation . her lung and pericardic examination is regular rate and rhythm . her abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended . she has a pulsatile upper abdominal mass . extremities : are well perfused and she has a small left inguinal hernia . she has a well healed right groin scar and pulse examination reveals 2 plus pulses from the carotids through the posterior tibial arteries bilaterally . neurologically she is awake and alert , she has normal cranial nerve function and her motor examination is within normal limits . laboratory data on admission : is remarkable for normal serum electrolytes with creatinine 1.2 , hematocrit 31.9 and normal coagulation studies . ekg reveals a normal sinus rhythm , normal intervals with slight left ventricular hypertrophy repolarization abnormality . her chest x-ray is remarkable only for a tortuous aorta on the anterior projection . hospital course : the patient was admitted and underwent resection and grafting of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm which she tolerated well . there were no intraoperative complications . she was taken to the surgical intensive care unit postoperatively . the patient 's procedure was also remarkable for the fact that she underwent spinal cooling during this procedure . the patient remained intubated postoperatively . she had a stable first postoperative day without evidence of hemodynamic or cardiopulmonary deterioration . on postoperative day 1 she had a slight hematocrit drop to 27.2 which was expected with hydration in addition to intraoperative volume loss but otherwise had an unremarkable course . epidural anesthesia was used throughout her course for pain management and she was transferred to the surgical floor on postoperative day two . the patient developed an episode of atrial fibrillation with physical examination consistent with only mild cardiopulmonary congestion as manifested by bilateral scattered rales in the lung fields . serum electrolytes at the time revealed normal potassium levels and the patient was treated with p.r.n. verapamil and digoxin therapy for a heart rate varying between 80 and 110 . the patient 's oxygen saturations continued to maintain at levels greater than 95 percent and this was felt to be well controlled and she was placed on digoxin chronically and also diuresed for therapy . she was transferred to the surgical floor where on postoperative day three she began to complain of hypersensitivity in the left lower extremity and inability to move her toes . this was a new finding considering postoperatively she had full motor and sensory function of all four extremities . neurologic assessment at the time did in fact reveal profound paresis of the left lower extremity only with absent reflexes but hyperesthesia to light touch throughout the lower extremities . laboratory data obtained revealed no significant changes from her initial postoperative levels . neurological consultation was obtained . it was felt that the patient had been subjected significant cord ischemia and possibly this neurologic event also related to spinal or epidural catheter placement . the epidural catheter had been removed prior to their evaluation and no return of significant function was noted over the ensuing two days aside from flexion and extension of the toes but still the patient maintained profound proximal lower extremity weakness . mri obtained did not reveal evidence of a structural cause for cord or root dysfunction and further recommendation of abdominal ct scanning in addition to emgs and sseps to further evaluate and confirm the site of the lesion be performed . the patient continued to do well otherwise being slowly progressed in her diet and mobilized from bed to chair without difficulty . she was placed on a bowel regimen to alleviate signs and symptoms of constipation while the workup to determine the exact etiology of her left lower extremity paresis could be identified . continued supportive care was performed for the patient as again she manifested no other significant signs of hemodynamic or neurologic deterioration . her ultimate diagnosis was subsequently felt to be a segmental infarction of the anterior and lateral part of her t10 level spinal cord and there was no evidence of that recovery of her left lower extremity would be obtained . social service consultation for rehabilitation placement was performed . the patient understands the ramifications of her disability and continued neurologic assessment is to be made . the patient continued to make slight gains in motor movement of the left lower extremity as manifested by digital function and some knee jerk return and by postoperative day eight she was manifesting some dorsiflexion in addition to urodynamics being performed revealed good detrusion contraction , normal sensation and a coordinated sphincter which suggested no disability to the sympathetic control of her bowel and bladder . the patient complained of some urinary incontinence and urgency on the 10th postoperative day . she was placed on bactrim therapy for e. coli positive urine culture and emg performed revealed a lesion proximal in the central nervous system ( cns ) consistent with central lesions . additional neurological follow-up will be maintained as the patient continues to rehabilitate in the on modenyheatl rowbrook of medical center . it is at this point encouraging that she continues to slowly regain some motor function of the left lower extremity but the patient has been advised that this may in fact not return . condition on discharge : is satisfactory . discharge diagnosis : (1) status post thoracoabdominal aneurysm grafting and resection . complications : during this hospitalization include left lower extremity paresis as well as e. coli urinary tract infection . discharge medications : lopressor 25 mg po b.i.d. , dulcolax tablets 2 po q.a.m. , dulcolax suppository 1 po q.o.d. , digoxin .125 mg po q. day , bactrim ds b.i.d. , tylenol 650 mg po / pr q. 4 hours p.r.n. elevated temperature , benadryl 25-50 po q.h.s. and percocet 1-2 tablets po q. 4 hours p.r.n. pain . followup : the patient will follow up with dr. riode

principal diagnosis : orthostatic hypotension . other problems : hyponatremia . hypokalemia . history of present illness : the patient is a 66 year old white female without a significant past medical history who presented in the middso memorial hospital emergency room following a nine day history of dizziness on standing without loss of consciousness . during the week prior to admission , the patient complained of severe constipation , dry mouth , possible urinary retention along with some nausea and vomiting . she felt that she was profoundly cold at the time . in the emergency room , the patient was hypotensive with an initial blood pressure of 92/70 and a pulse of 96 lying flat that became 70/50 with a pulse of 104 when standing . the patient was aggressively hydrated with a total of 9 liters of normal saline over a 7 hour period with marginal increase in blood pressure . over the same period of time , the patient became increasingly hypoxic and developed worsening hypertension . stat chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema . the patient was subsequently transferred to the micu on dopamine for further management . past medical history : only noticeable for remote appendectomy and being gravida v , para v . medications on admission : none . allergies : no known drug allergies . social history : the patient has an 80-pack-year history of tobacco and is currently smoking 1-2 packs per day . she also has a questionable alcohol history of up to one quart daily . she is married and lives with her husband . family history : notable for coronary artery disease in both parents without a history of cancer or autoimmune disease , diabetes , thyroid disease . physical examination : the patient was an agitated elderly white female . temperature 97.8 , blood pressure 112/58 on dopamine , pulse 134 , respirations 28 , oxygen saturation 93% on 100% nonrebreather . heent : showed pupils equal , round and reactive to light . extraocular muscles intact . oropharynx benign . eyebrows were notable for lateral thinning . neck was supple without lymphadenopathy . carotids were 2+ . no palpable thyroid . lungs showed decreased breath sounds bilaterally . cardiac exam revealed s1 , s2 with an intermittent s4 without murmur or rubs . abdominal exam was benign . extremities showed mild clubbing , no cyanosis and no edema . neurologic exam : the patient was alert , agitated and oriented to name , date and place moving all extremities . light touch was intact . admission labs : sodium 127 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 76 , bicarb 35 , bun 13 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 105 , serum osmolality 254 , hematocrit 43.5 , white count 10.0 with 68% polys , 20% lymphs and 10 monos . platelets 310 . pt and ptt were normal . lft 's were within normal limits . admission cortisol , aldosterone , b12 and folate and tsh were drawn . chest x-ray on transfer to the micu showed pulmonary vascular redistribution without infiltrate , effusions or nodules as compared with an admission chest x-ray which was interpreted as clear . hospital course : in the micu , the patient initially required dopamine for five days , at which point , she tolerated a wean without recurrent light headedness , dizziness or syncope . echocardiogram revealed preserved ejection fraction without regional wall motion abnormalities . the patient had a swan-ganz catheter placed which showed a cardiac output of 8 with systemic vascular resistance of 700 . because the swan-ganz readings were felt to be explained by sepsis , the patient was treated empirically with cefotaxime , gentamicin and flagyl . all cultures were subsequently negative with the exception of an e coli uti . the infectious workup included a lumbar puncture which was negative for pleocytosis but showed an elevated glucose of 106 and an elevated protein of 76 . the patient had an extensive workup for hypopituitarism . because addisonian crisis could not be initially ruled out , the patient was placed on distressed dose cortisone . however , a random cortisol level drawn initially in the emergency room subsequently returned as normal . the patient also responded appropriately to cortrosyn stimulation test . also , tsh was normal on admission . thyroid function panel drawn while the patient was on dopamine was subsequently abnormal . however , repeat panel was drawn when the patient was stable and had been transferred to the floor and was pending at the time of discharge . the patient was also evaluated by the neurology service for possible dysautonomia as the cause of her orthostatic hypotension with an inappropriate heart rate response to hypotension . emg showed no evidence of peripheral neuropathy . additional studies also included a head ct that showed a small lacunar infarct in the right pons and a partial empty sella which was confirmed by head mri . other studies sent during the workup included a negative serum and urine protein electrophoresis , negative serum and urine immunoglobulin electrophoresis . lh and ssh levels were consistent with a post-menopausal state . galactin levels were within normal limits . ana was negative . ace level was negative . heavy metal screen was negative except for a slightly elevated cobalt level so a possibility of a perineoplastic syndrome was considered . an anti-yo ri and who antibodies were sent and were pending at the time of discharge . on hospital day eight , the patient had uneventfully weaned off dopamine and was transferred to the floor . at that time , the stress dose hydrocortisone was weaned and the patient was switched to prednisone without any evidence of recurrent hypotension . her initial hyponatremia and hypokalemia resolved with stable sodium and potassium levels prior to discharge . in the studying of aggressive fluid resuscitation , it was felt that the patient had been sent into pulmonary edema . the patient auto-diuresed spontaneously . subsequent to the diuresis , reticulonodular diffuse pattern became apparent on chest x-ray . because of the patient 's significant smoking history , chest pt was performed to evaluate the possibility of lymphangitic carcinomatosis . however , the chest ct showed relative sparing of the lower lobes with primary involvement in both upper lobes . the patient following diuresis had no oxygen requirement whatsoever and had no respiratory complaints . prior to discharge , she was evaluated by the pulmonary service who felt that the differential diagnosis for her chest ct included eosinophilic granuloma , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , less likely sarcoidosis . because the patient had no respiratory symptoms , it was felt that her abnormal chest ct would be best evaluated as an out-patient . a new baseline chest x-ray was obtained prior to discharge . she will also require baseline pulmonary function tests as an out-patient . medications on discharge : prednisone taper 40 mg p.o. q day times two days , 30 mg p.o. q day times two days , 20 mg p.o. q day times three days , 10 mg p.o. q day times three days , 5 mg p.o. q day times three days . multi-vitamin one p.o. q day . condition on discharge : stable . disposition : the patient

gemenadentoolpai medical center with a revolving anterolateral wall myocardial infarction on 08-01-93 . she has been under the care of dr. aalv manual and was referred here for further therapy . she had no prior significant cardiac history and presented to her local medical doctor 's office with an episode of severe retrosternal chest pain . her electrocardiogram showed a new right bundle branch block and left anterior hemiblock . the patient was transferred to the gemenadentoolpai medical center and was admitted . her hospital course was remarkable for ruling in for a myocardial infarction with a peak cpk of 9,379 units with a 5.9% mb fraction . in addition , on telemetry she developed complete heart block and hypotension requiring temporary pacing wire and then a permanent pacemaker implantation on 08-03-93 . she developed congestive heart failure and required pressor support . she underwent cardiac catheterization on 8-15-93 and was found to have a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 28 millimeters of mercury . she had a dominant right coronary artery with minor disease . the main left coronary artery had a 20% stenosis . the left anterior descending had a severe 80% proximal stenosis with a filling defect consistent with intraluminal thrombus . the circumflex artery had a minor 40% stenosis . cine left ventriculogram revealed a dilated left ventricle with an area of anterolateral , apical , and septal akinesis . the left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to 38% . the patient was transferred to the heaonboburg linpack grant medical center for consideration of coronary angioplasty . cardiac risk factors : her risk factors for coronary artery disease included a positive family history and an elevated cholesterol level . past medical history : her past medical history is remarkable for a history of parkinson 's disease . physical examination : her physical examination at the time of admission revealed a pleasant lady in no acute distress . the blood pressure was 120/70 millimeters of mercury . her pulse was regular at 80 beats per minute . the jugular venous pressure was elevated at 6 cm above the sternal angle . the carotids were normal . the chest was clear . the cardiac examination revealed anapical impulse in the fifth left intercostal space , left to mid clavicular line . the first sound was normal . the second sound was normally split . she had no murmurs and no gallops . the examination the abdomen was benign . the examination of the extremities showed no edema . she had good pulses bilaterally . laboratory data : her electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm , left atrial enlargement , left axis deviation , poor r-wave progression in v1 through v4 , consistent with marked clockwise rotation , cannot rule out an old anteroseptal wall myocardial infarction . there were prominent q-waves in avl , consistent with lateral myocardial infarction . there were non-specific st-t wave abnormalities . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the medical service . the patient was seen in consultation by the neurology department because of the history of parkinson 's disease . the patient was maintained on intravenous heparin . on 8-17-93 , she was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where she underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the proximal left anterior descending . following balloon angioplasty , there was a local dissection with evidence of intraluminal thrombus , with a greater than 10% loss in the initial gain following coronary angioplasty . therefore , directional coronary atherectomy was performed with an excellent angiographic outcome , and a less than 10% residual narrowing . the patient tolerated the procedure well . she was maintained on intravenous heparin and was brought back to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on 08-18-93 for a relook coronary angiography . coronary angiography demonstrated ongoing benefit of the initial coronary atherectomy . specifically , there was no decrease in the initial gain that she achieved after directional atherectomy . the patient remained stable during the rest of the

principal diagnosis : ruptured parathyroid adenoma . history of present illness : ms. shuffa is a 73-year-old portuguese speaking woman who was transferred via med flight to verg medical center . she arrived intubated and was hemodynamically stable despite concerns of a dissecting aortic arch aneurysm . she initially presented to brottlake medical center on 9/15/00 complaining of acute onset dysphasia to liquids and solids . while she was in brottlake medical center , she developed new onset stridor , and an ent consult was obtained . they attempted a fiberoptic intubation with a # 6 endotracheal tube and found a 5 mm severely compressed airway . she was also found to have a differential systolic blood pressure and ecchymosis on her anterior chest . given these findings , she underwent a ct scan which showed a retrotracheal mass that appeared to obliterate the esophagus . this raised concerns for a hemorrhage , and she was transferred to verg medical center emergently . at the ingree and ot of weamanshy medical center , she underwent an emergent ct scan with iv contrast . this revealed no extravasation of contrast and no aortic aneurysm . however , it did show an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with a density consistent with a hematoma . she was admitted to the thoracic surgery service under the care of dr. sccrookes . past medical history : severe hypertension , angina , gerd , peptic ulcer disease , status post billroth ii , ovarian cancer , status post tah-bso in 1987 with a negative second look laparotomy in 1988 , chronic anemia , chronic left ear infection . medications prior to admission : celexa 10 mg p.o. q.d.; lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.; capoten 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.; pepcid 20 mg p.o. q.d.; cardizem 180 mg p.o. q.d.; xanax 0.5 mg tabs . on transfer , she was on her preadmission medications plus unasyn and tigan 250 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. allergies : no known drug allergies . social history : she is divorced and retired . she lives with her daughter , and denies any tobacco or alcohol use . physical examination : the patient is intubated . vital signs : temperature 98.6 , 66 . right arm was 180/80 , left 188/72 , and a-line was 151/61 . tidal volume is 700 with a rate of 10 , 10 of pressure support , and 10 of peep , and 100% fio2 , satting 100% . general : she was sedated and spontaneously moving all four extremities . neck : edematous . trachea was midline . she had bilateral crepitus in the anterior neck . the superior clavicular area showed no signs of central line access attempts . she had a 3 cm mobile gelatinous well-circumscribed mass in the right supraclavicular region . her anterior neck and chest had a 1 cm to 2 cm area of ecchymosis . lungs : she had bilateral expiratory wheezes . abdomen : soft with good bowel sounds . it was nontender . it was obese with a large midline defect consistent with a ventral hernia , as well as a smaller anterior defect in the left lower quadrant . both were easily reducible . pulse : on the right side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , dp , pt , and radial ; on the left side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , dp , pt , and radial . laboratory data : cbc was 8.7 , 25.3 , and 184 . coags 12.2 , 24.8 , and 1.0 . her gas was 7.47/40/332 . electrolytes were 143 , 3.4 , 105 , 28 , 24 , 3 , and 131 . ekg showed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and incomplete left bundle branch block . ct scan showed an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with air . it was consistent with a hematoma . hospital course : ms. shuffa underwent an egd and flexible bronchoscopy on 9/16/00 shortly after she arrived . this showed tracheal compressions but no other lesions that were obvious at the time . she was hemodynamically stable and remained on the ventilator . the differential diagnoses at this point consisted of hematoma vs. neoplasm vs. an abscess vs. a thyroid tumor . on 9/22/00 , she underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy . a biopsy of this mass was consistent with hematoma . the operative report shows that there was an abnormal area below the trachea to the left which represented a cavity between the esophagus , trachea , aorta , and spine that was full of clot . there was no active bleeding at the time . over the next several days , the patient remained hemodynamically stable on the ventilator . she had an elevated calcium level that raised the suspicion that this mass could be a hematoma coming from a ruptured parathyroid adenoma . the ionized calcium was elevated as was the parathormone level . given these findings , she underwent a sestamibi scan . the sestamibi scan showed findings that were consistent with a parathyroid adenoma in the right lobe of the thyroid . at this time , it was believed that her clot was due to a rupture of this parathyroid adenoma . dr. ear brought the patient to the operating room on 10/5/00 . she underwent a parathyroid exploration with resection of a ruptured ectopic right upper parathyroid adenoma , a biopsy of a normal left and right lower parathyroids , resection of a left upper parathyroid , and tracheostomy . she tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the surgical intensive care unit with her new tracheostomy working well . her postoperative course was complicated by serosanguineous pleural effusion on the left . this required a chest tube . her hematocrit continued to drop over the next couple of days despite normal platelet count , normal coags , and no obvious source of bleeding . it was believed that she was continuing to bleed in her chest . however , we are not quite sure why this was occurring . she underwent an extensive workup by hematology that revealed a bleeding diatheses of unknown etiology . it turns out that several people in her family have a similar bleeding diathesis of unknown etiology . in conclusion , by systems : 1. neuro . the patient became intermittently agitated . we have been giving her haldol at bedtime as well as ativan p.r.n. throughout the day . she responds well to this . she speaks some english and seems to understand more than she speaks . she has a family member who is present for approximately 12 hours each day . she has been very helpful in translating and seems to say that ms. shuffa is in good spirits . 2. cardiac . the patient 's blood pressure has been ranging from approximately 140 to 160 systolic . this is on a current regimen of lopressor 25 mg per ng tube t.i.d. as well as diltiazem 60 mg per ng tube t.i.d. , and lisinopril 10 mg per ng tube q.d. she occasionally gets hypertensive when she is agitated . for this , we have given her 10 mg of hydralazine . her blood pressure responds well to this . otherwise , she is in normal sinus rhythm and has been hemodynamically stable throughout her hospitalization . the patient developed a left femoral artery pseudoaneurysm after placement of a greenfield filter . this has been followed by the vascular surgery service here at the ingree and ot of weamanshy medical center . dr. lenni lung has been consulted . the aneurysm at the time of discharge is approximately 2.5 cm . they elected not to inject it with thrombin . they asked that the patient follow-up with dr. ear in approximately three to four weeks so that this aneurysm can be assessed . they have opted for conservative management given the size . 3. respiratory . at the time of discharge , the patient remained on cpap with a peep of 7.5 and a pressure support of 9 . she seems to be tolerating this well as she has an o2 sat of 100% on 40% fio2 . her chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe hematoma that had greatly improved in the last few days . her right lung field is clear . her tracheostomy is functioning well , and we have had no problems with it . she will obviously need to be weaned as tolerated . we had her down to a low pressure support of 7 in the last week . with the pressure support at 7 , she became tachypneic and had to be brought back up to 10 . her oxygen saturation has always been good . 4. gi . the patient is getting tube feeds via her ng tube of full strength jevity of 75 cc per hour . this is her goal . she tolerates them very well and has approximately 200 cc to 300 cc of stool per day . last week , she had copious amounts of stool in the range of 500 cc to 1000 cc of liquid stool per day . stool cultures have been sent numerous times as well as analysis for c. difficile toxin . these have all been negative . we believe the this was an osmotic diarrhea . since her tube feeds have been changed from full strength nephro to jevity , her diarrhea has resolved . she has been taking zantac , and the ph of her ng tube residuals have been in the 5 to 8 range . 5. gu . the patient has had hypernatremia . she is approximately 10 kg up her overall body weight . we believe her to still be total body overloaded . over the last several days , we have been giving her approximately 500 cc to 1000 cc of free water through her ng tube . we also have been diuresing her with bumex . this seems to trend her sodium down . this will need to be monitored closely . her bun and creatinine have been normal , and she has always made good urine . 6. heme . as stated before , the patient continued to ooze into her pleural space well after her definitive operation . she had an extensive workup by hematology which revealed a bleeding diathesis of unknown origin . before we removed her chest tube , we had to give her platelets . she had no problems with this . at the time of discharge , her hematocrit is stable in the 28 to 33 range . i stress that she cannot be anticoagulated . we have given her lovenox in the past , and she continues to bleed . therefore , she is on no dvt prophylaxis . she does have a left iliac deep vein thrombosis . she has a greenfield filter in place , and this is her only dvt prophylaxis . 7. id . at the time of discharge , the patient has a urinary tract infection . she is growing enterobacter cloacae that is sensitive only to macrodantin from her urine cultures . interestingly enough , she also has enterobacter cloacae growing out of her sputum . this is also sensitive only to macrodantin . we do not believe that she has any respiratory process going on at the time . she is just begun on macrodantin at the day of discharge and should continue 100 mg per ng tube q.i.d. for a ten day course . her foley was changed the day before discharge . 8. tubes , lines , and drains . the patient has a tracheostomy , ng tube , and a foley catheter . her central line , which was left subclavian quad lumen , was removed on the day of discharge . discharge medications : albuterol nebulizers 2.5 mg q.4h. and atrovent nebulizers 0.5 mg q.4h. , please alternate albuterol and atrovent ; rocaltrol 0.25 mcg per ng tube q.d.; calcium carbonate 1250 mg per ng tube q.i.d.; vitamin b12 1000 mcg im q. month , next dose is due nov 18 ; diltiazem 60 mg per
