{"id": 7, "label": "current-smoker", "text": "history of present illness : this is a 64 year old patient initially admitted to dr. riode area status post an aorto bifemoral bypass in 01/98 with an end to end proximal and to the common femoral bilaterally . the patient has had recurrent claudication for the last five months and has developed lesions on the first toe which is apparently similar to aparonychia . he had an angiogram which shows a severe stenosis in the right distal area with a thrombosing right limb of an aorto femoral graft . he also has an irregular lesion at the profunda femoris origin and with the superficial femoral occluded bilaterally . he was therefore admitted to the hospital for an ileofemoral bypass . the patient unfortunately continues to smoke and has greater than a 50 pack year history of smoking and by notes of dr. area 's office , this has been discussed at length with him and the implications of the smoking . he has a history of a deep vein thrombosis and a question of a pulmonary embolism with what is thought to be a non fully documented hypercoagulable state . he had a left superficial femoral artery interposition graft around 1990 which is non functioning at the present time , most of which was done at the alconspore woocawo medical center . allergies : the patient has no known drug allergies . medications on admission : his medications on admission include coumadin and levofloxacin . his coumadin has been held for two days . his claudication is equal bilaterally . physical examination : on physical examination was remarkable for no carotid bruits , a ventral hernia without any masses which was reasonably reducible . his rectal exam was refused at the time of surgery since apparently it was negative at the tocon hospital the previous week . he has a first and fourth toe which had some purulent discharge around the toes with ischemic modeled toes and on the left side there were no lesions in the feet . his pulse exam was a femoral pulse bilaterally , but none distally . laboratory data : his bun and creatinine were within normal limits at 16 and 1.3 and his hematocrit was 44 with a white blood count of 10,000 and 139,000 platelet count . he has ankle brachial indices of .36 bilaterally but with his right toes appearing ischemic with lesions he would most likely not heal these lesions . hospital course : dr. area had asked me to see the patient and after discussing with the patient it was agreed that i would proceed with revascularization of his right leg since he had a angiogram which demonstrated a failing limb of his aortofemoral graft and a tight profundus stenosis . after discussing with the patient , getting his prothrombin time closer to range , he was brought to the operating room where a ileo profunda bypass was performed with an 8 mm . ep to fe under general endotracheal anesthesia . there was copious thrombus in the distal right limb of the aortofemoral graft which also had a thromboendarterectomy performed and excellent inflow was achieved . superficial femoral artery was divided since it was also chronically occluded . there was a significant amount of thrombus at the anastomosis as well which had developed a small aneurysmaltype of dilatation , although there was no dehiscence of the anastomosis . the profunda had been opened beyond the origin stenosis and the bypass was then performed providing and excellent flow to the calf and excellent pulsevolume recordings were obtained with strong upstrokes . it was therefore elected not to proceed with a distal bypass graft to the popliteal arteries which would have been required should this not have worked . the patient postoperatively did quite well . he had continued good post volume recordings and there was no question that with this improved circulation and silvadene dressings to his toes that they actually started to heal in his postoperative course with improved perfusion and capillary refill . his groin incision was healing nicely and he was on heparin , being converted to coumadin . because of the issue relating to his hypercoagulable state , and the need for getting him in range , he was keptin the hospital and not discharged . the orders of his wounds and wound care were clarified and he was transferred to frontera 34 to ensure that this would be performed properly . no cellulitis was present , and the patient had indicated his desire to be discharged . despite loading him on coumadin , his prothrombin time and inr increased slowly and he left the hospital without discharge order or discharge planning on the 18th of december . i had called the patient and discussed with him his care , which he had been then transferring to his local medical doctor for anticoagulation purposes . i explained to the patient that because of his early discharge i would not be able to be responsible for his care but would be happy to see him in theoffice for removal of his sutures and an appointment for that was undertaken . degreg r. uph , m.d. electronically signed a lisswhiti area , m.d. 01/30/2001 04:33 _ tr : yg dd : 01/18/2001 td : 01/22/2001 9:24 pcc : riode

thallium . medications on discharge : metoprolol 50 mg po bid , isordil 20 mg po tid , enteric coated aspirin 1 po qd . history of present illness : the patient is a 65 year old portuguese male with a history of an anterior myocardial infarction i may 1993 and is status post a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the lad who presented on 10-24-93 with crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath . he had no prior cardiac history until may 1993 when on 5-24 he had crushing chest pain which radiated to his left arm . he was found at that time to have 3-4 mm st segment elevations in v1 through v4 at pre health . the patient was transferred to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital and had 4-7 mm st segment elevations across the precordium with q's in v1 and v2 , 2 mm st elevation in avl , and 1-2 mm reciprocal st depression in ii , iii , and f. on physical examination at that time he had bright red blood per rectum and therefore lysis was deferred and he was taken directly to the cardiac catheterization lab . the cardiac catheterization results at that time revealed a right atrial pressure of 7 , pulmonary artery pressure of 29/16 , rv 33/8 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 . he had a 95% proximal left anterior descending lesion which was ptca 'd to a residual of 30% and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed . he also had some mild to moderate disease at the om1 noted at that time . the patient was transferred to the cardiac care unit where he had a peak cpk of 5,042 and 26.7% mb's . his intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned without problems . he had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started . on day six , an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 44% with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis . on day nine , he had a low level exercise tolerance test with thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in ii , iii , and avf , and 1.5 mm downsloping st depressions in v5 and v6 , as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on thallium . therefore , he went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal pda lesion and a circumflex lesion after the om . the patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with dr. shuffburle of gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with dr. amesin of cardiology and dr. shuffpasc of dingclearf alllirefaith memorial hospital . however , he did not keep any of these appointments . he went home and did not take any of his medications and smoked and drank heavily throughout the several months . on the a.m. of 10-24-93 , the patient developed crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath . he came to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital emergency ward where he was noted to be ashen and diaphoretic . he was treated with oxygen , aspirin , five sublingual nitroglycerins , heparin , and was eventually made pain free with that regimen . cardiac risk factors : his cardiac risk factors included hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , cigarette smoking , and a positive family history . past medical history : his past medical history included hypertension and non-insulin diabetes mellitus which is diet controlled . past surgical history : his past surgical history had included gastric ulcer surgery and appendectomy . medications on admission : on admission , he was on isordil 10 tid and enteric coated aspirin , but he was not taking either of these medications . habits : the patient smokes one pack per day and has a history of heavy alcohol use . physical examination : the physical examination on admission revealed a blood pressure of 110/70 , a heart rate of 66 , respirations of 24 , temperature of 98 . the heent exam revealed the extra ocular movements intact . the pupils equal , round , reactive to light . the oropharynx was clear and the fundi were normal . there were no hypertensive or diabetic changes . the neck was suppled , with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention . the carotids were 1+ without bruits . the heart was regular rate and rhythm , s4 , s1 , s2 , with a i / vi systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border . the lungs were clear , except for a few dry crackles bibasilarly . the abdomen revealed a midline scar and a right lower quadrant scar , and it was soft and nontender wit positive bowel sounds . the liver edge was 2 cm below the right costal margin , but smooth and nontender . there was no splenomegaly . the femoral pulses were diminished . he had bilateral intertrigo in his femoral region as well as his axillae . the extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema . the pulses were 1+ bilaterally . the skin exam revealed changes consistent with vitiligo . the rectal examination was guaiac negative . laboratory data : the laboratory data revealed normal electrolytes , bun and creatinine , normal liver function tests , a first cpk of 140 , and a hematocrit of 43.1 . the portable chest x-ray showed clear lungs , slight enlarged heart , and a mildly elevated hemidiaphragm . the electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 81 , with normal intervals and normal axis , had poor r-wave progression consistent with an old anterior myocardial infarction , had flipped t-waves in v1 through v5 , which were of no significant change since his last ekg on 5-25-93 . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the step down unit for a rule out mi protocol . he was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin . no beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110/70 . the patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak cpk of 219 and 20.9% mb fraction . this was a non-q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes . on 10-27-93 , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been ptca 'd , a lesion in the first om , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the om3 . the left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle . given the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the ptca , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient . he was ambulated progressively on the floor . a beta blocker was started with metoprolol initially at 25 mg po bid and eventually increased to 50 mg po bid . the patient ambulated extensively on the fih 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath . on 11-2-93 , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with thallium imaging . this treadmill test was done on medications , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment . the patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified bruce protocol , however , he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade . there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm st depression in ii , iii , and avf . the study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain . thallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle . there was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test . these images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous thallium images in may 1993 . after extensive discussion between myself , dr. amesin , and dr. scgach , it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management . the patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although he understands that this may become necessary in the future . dr. amesin had a long discussion with the patient 's daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient 's compliance . previously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments . the importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient . she will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with dr. amesin as well as dr. lfsquarc on the outside . the patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization . despite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done . he will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future . caghala uinteele , m.d. tr : yf / bmot dd : 11-3-93 td : 11/04/93 cc : dr. telshey swatlleebtik dr. eri lfsquarc "}

creatinine was 0.8 and glucose was 96 . otherwise , the sma 20 was within normal limits . white count was 5.5 , hematocrit was 43.5 , and mcv was 9l . platelet count was 350,000 . differential included 66 polys , 24 lymphocytes , 3 monocytes , and l eosinophil . pt was l3.l and ptt was 30.9 . urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of l.0l5 , a ph of 8.0 , l+ ketones , and no blood . chest x-ray showed hyperinflation bilaterally and loss of the anterior clear space on the lateral film likely secondary to arm position since the patient was unable to raise up her arm from weakness stemming from her multiple sclerosis . ekg showed baseline artifacts , sinus tachycardia at l05 , pr interval of 0.l6 , qrs of 0.08 , qt of 0.36 , an axis of 60 degrees , poor r wave progression with

lumbar puncture which revealed a glucose of 73 , a protein of 38 , positive oligoclonal bands with an igg to albumin ratio of 0.485 . cell count was l white cell and 5l red cells with a differential of 90 lymphocytes and l0 monocytes in tube number four and two white cells and 600 red cells with a differential of 5 polys , 90 lymphocytes , and 5 monocytes in tube number one . patient also had an mri scan of the head which showed a lesion in the left pons consistent with multiple sclerosis . serum igg was elevated at l,520 . spep showed an elevated gamma spike of l.83 and was otherwise within normal limits . the patient underwent lenti pidesrah non community hospital multiple sclerosis treatment , group ii protocol with cytoxan and acth induction with the plan for maintenance methylprednisolone after discharge . she tolerated the protocol medications well except for some nausea and vomiting which was relatively well controlled with anti-emetic medication and also some very mild hematuria to the tune of 20 to 25 red blood cells on micro . this was , in fact , consistent with the fact that she had an indwelling foley placed on admission after post-void residual was noted to be 200 cc of urine . she received occupational therapy and physical therapy during the hospitalization . 2) anemia - patient had a steady drop in hematocrit from the admission value of 43.5 to the range of about 3l by hospital day number eight which remained stable at this point . she had guaiac negative stools , no menses , no significant hematuria , and no signs of hemolysis . work-up included an iron of l24 , tibc of 207 , a ferritin of l24 , and bl2 and folate were pending but unlikely to be contributing to this acute drop . haptoglobin was l79 with a normal bilirubin and a normal ldh . glucose was 6 , phosphate deficiency was checked with a normal level of 25 being measured , and reticulocyte count of less than 0.l% was noted at one point with follow-up reticulocyte count of 0.l% noted on the day prior to discharge . this was felt to be consistent with decreased bone marrow production of new red cells and possibly a hematocrit drop secondary to in-hospital phlebotomy with some dilutional component secondary to intravenous and p.o. hydration . patient did not show coincident decrease in white count or platelet count . a clot was sent to the blood bank , however , the patient did not require a transfusion . she did receive bactrim for a urinary tract infection and this medication was discontinued given its potential for aplasia in the bone marrow . patient will be followed up with subsequent cbc on the september , the september , the september , and the septemberth of 2006 to assure that her hematocrit recovers . 3) urinary tract infection - patient had too numerous to count white cells on urinalysis on 08/15/90 and was thus begun on bactrim ds one tablet p.o. b.i.d. subsequently , urine culture prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy grew out pan sensitive e. coli , greater than l00,000 including sensitivities to bactrim . patient received a seven day course of bactrim ds one tablet b.i.d. with resolution of symptoms and subsequent negative culture . her foley will be discontinued at discharge and she will continue home straight catheterizations given her post-void residual of 200 cc on admission per the visiting nurse . disposition : discharge medications : multivitamins one tablet p.o. q.d. , halcion 0.l25 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n.

epiglottis . ent examination was then to be performed . chest x-ray showed significant kiphosis but otherwise no significant lesions at all . past medical history : negative . past surgical history : negative . medications on admit : none . allergies : none . smoking none . family history : negative . alcohol none . social history : lives in an old age facility but is quite active and quite independent . physical examination : the patient was sitting upright and was not drooling and was able to swallow her secretions although she did have a very wet voice which got progressively more hoarse during the examination . she had no respiratory distress but did choose to sit in an upright position . her ear examination was normal . nasal examination was normal . oral cavity was normal . neck : revealed fullness in the submental and suprahyoid regions with mild tenderness which was consistent with edema of the soft tissues without significant mass . neck : otherwise normal and the trachea was midline . hypopharyngeal examiantion revealed a severely edematous , yellowish-white epiglottis with significantly edematous base of tongue which had marked watery edema . the left pyriform was obliterated by edema . the right pyriform was narrowed by edema . the epiglottis was so edematous that is was pushed back posteriorly and abutted the posterior oropharynx completely obscuring the larynx . the patient had no stridor and it was clear that she must be breathing around the epiglottis . there was blood oozing out from the left lateral epiglottis at the region consistent with its base although this was unclear for identification secondary to edema and it was possible that she may have had a lesion in this area . lungs : clear . heart : regular rate and rhythm . s1 and s2 , no murmurs , rubs or gallops . abdomen : soft , nontender , positive bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly , no bruits . no masses . extremities : normal . back : showed significant thoracic kiphosis . laboratory examination : revealed a wbc count of 11.6 , h and h of 10.7 and 31.7 , platelet count of 268 , differential 94 polys , 0 bands , 5 lymphs , one mono . as noted above , lateral neck film revealed marked edema of the epiglottis . the chest x-ray showed signficant kiphosis with several areas of increased interstitial markings but otherwise negative . hospital course : the patient was felt to have epiglottitis , possibly secondary to a malignancy , especially in her age group . she was started on iv ceftriaxone two grams and was given humidification . due to the marked amount of edema , it was felt that she should go the operating room emergently for elective intubation . she was taken to the operating room at approximately 2:00 a.m. which was approximately one hour after being evaluated by ent and was intubated awake over a fiberoptic bronchoscope through the left nares with nasal anesthetic only with a #6 endotracheal tube . the patient was sedated . direct laryngoscopy was performed but this revealed only a large amount of base of tongue edema with minimally visible epiglottis which was also significantly edematous and no distinct mass or lesion could be noted . she was transferred to the sicu where she was kept sedated and was given ceftriaxone one gram q. 12 h. as well as iv steroids for the first 24 hours consisting of decadron 8 mg q. 8 h. x 3 doses in addition to 10 mg that she received in the emergency room on the way down to the operating room . her initial hospital course while intubated was significant for an episode of atrial fibrillation which she went into in the operating room . at the end of the case she had had a central line placed also for frequent blood draws at the request of the sicu house office . her episode of atrial fibrillation as we planned to take her from the operating room after both the intubation and central line placement had been completed . she had no trouble with blood pressure with this atrial fibrillation with rates going up to 150 . she was given a dose of digoxin but broke spontaneously approximately two minutes after the digoxin was given . ekg and enzymes were obtained and showed the first degree av block that she had had on her preoperative ekg but no other findings at all . she continued in normal sinus rhythm and was transferred to the icu where she was monitored . her blood gases and o2 saturations correlated well and we used o2 saturations to follow her as well as venous gases and she continued to maintain good o2 saturation . she was kept ventilated because she was kept sedated . she went into an svt the afternoon after intubation and a decision was made to digitalize her , keeping her level between approximately .6 and 1 . she continued in sinus rhythm after this episode of svt and again had no problems with her blood pressure during that . her edema decreased over the next two days and repeat fiberoptic examination on both 4/3 and 4/4 revealed decreasing edema . on 4/5/91 in the icu under controlled conditions , she was electively extubated and had no problems . she was kept on ceftriaxone but no further steroids were given . examination at that time revealed question of a lesion at the left lateral glossoepiglottic fold . otherwise her examination was normal with good visualization of the larynx and significant decrease in size of the epiglottis . of note , during her first hospital day when she received steroids her blood sugars did increase significantly and therefore she was started on insulin . once the steroids were stopped , the insulin was able to be stopped . tube feedings were started on 4/3/91 and the ng tube was discontinued on 4/5/91 prior to extubation to give a better look at the epiglottis prior to extubating her . after extubation she was watched in the icu for 24 hours and she did well except for some episodes of confusion happening the night of extubation and also the next morning . again , mi was ruled out and metabolic tests were within normal limits . o2 saturations looked good . it was felt that this was a mild episode of icu psychosis . she was followed on the regular floor 24 hours after extubation and had no further problems with her airway . she was maintained on ceftriaxone and then switched to augmentin and remained afebrile . her white counts came down . blood cultures which had been drawn at the time of intubation were negative . she had a geriatric consult due to her confusion and they suggested as we had already done to stop all sedatives and sleeping medications . cardiology was contacted and recommended that given her history she should be taken off all digoxin and just watched and that her svts may have been just secondary to stress of intubation . unfortunately the episodes of atrial fibrillation and svt were apparently not documented well enough in terms of ekg strips to aid cardiology and therefore , they gave us an informal consult so that no formal consult will be found in this chart . nonetheless , their input was greatly appreciated and she was taken off of digoxin and had no further problems with her heart . her mental status began to clear under the family 's request . disposition : on 4/9/91 she was sent home on a week of augmentin and will followup in the ent clinic . our plan will be to establish whether or not she truly had an epiglottic lesion . she , of note , had no history of foreign body ingestion or any abrasion or trauma to this area . if she does have a lesion , then we may entertain , given her age , the possibility of radiating this lesion as opposed to putting her through laryngectomy . discharge medications are augmentin 500 mg t.i.d. x 7 days . the patient is to followup in the ent clinic in approximately one week . discharge diagnosis : epiglottitis , question secondary to epiglottic malignancy . rg556/4903 eento works , m.d. nl6 d : 04/10/91 batch : 5391 report : u5989c79 t :

pupils were miotic , measuring 2 mm but responsive to light . neck - tender on the leftside with no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly . lungs were clear . chest actually had a 5 x 7 cm necrotic area on the left chest wall with some pus . cardiovascular - normal . abdomen - normal . there was no hsm . extremities - her left arm was very swollen . it was tested with no voluntary movement except at the finger tips . there was no edema elsewhere in her extremities , only the left arm . neuro - the patient was oriented to place , but had difficulty with recent memory . she also had mild weakness in the left extremities , both upper and lower . cranial nerves ii - xii were grossly intact . toes were downgoing . laboratory data : of note - na 133 , k 4 , wbc 8.82 , hematocrit 35.1 , platelets 229 . pt 13.8 with an inr of 1.3 , ptt 25.5 , total protein was 6.2 , albumin 3.4 , globulin of 2.8 , calcium of 9.1 , phos 2.7 , mag 2.1 , urea 3.7 . alt was elevated at 240 , ast 85 , ldh 305 , alk phos 85 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , direct bili was .8 . cholesterol 188 , triglyceride was 127 . ua - trace protein , trace ketones , positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1+ bacteria . chest x-ray - showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia . in summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell ca , status post chemotherapy with cmsap and pvsc and xrt who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall . the keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea . when she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with iv antibiotics . so she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her . also at the time of admission we were also considering palliative taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined . she refused the taxol therapy so that was not done . another major issue with this patient was pain control . she had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion . so pain control was a big issue so she was on ms contin and msir at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management . one of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at c6-c7 interface on 1-6-94 . after that the patient had minimal relief of pain . however , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her . so accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up . she is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch . she is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours . we can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain . other things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead ct for her on the 8th of january because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking . we went ahead and got a head ct scanand it showed no enhancing lesions . in addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that . that has been stable . the patient on january 13 became hyponatremic . her sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 . a renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as siadh . we proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it . we had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction . in addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient 's sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116. so that has really improved . we suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day . on the 14th of january , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with hampton 's hump . also a vq scan obtained the next day showed high probability for pe . so we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s. her inr is 2.3 . we want her inr to remain between 2 and 3 . so if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night . however , we would leave it at 2.5 for now . other major issues - as a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also . we put her on nifedipine ir , sl and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol . so on discharge she is on atenolol 100 . if needed to you can give her some nifedipine sl to decrease her blood pressure . the patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so i think that fluid restriction should help with that . she is also a little dry . the patient is on oxygen . ever since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen . she was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters . we would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well . the complications that i have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure . disposition : discharge medications - baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d. , mvi one tablet p.o. q.d. , mycostatin powder tp q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d. condition on discharge : fair . she remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema . she is to go to the necsoncardel medical center for more chronic care . follow-up is with dr. wedleung in the hem / onc in two weeks . the appointment has already been made . the patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain primarily and her difficulty breathing . dictated by : jeabriharl figefreiermfothgrendcajaque , m.d. attending : la inemacistin prontmandes , m.d. hd45 sy882/1177 batch : 020 index no. yjqi3j9vu6 d : 01/25/94 t : 01/25/94 "}

droop and hand weakness after glaucoma laser surgery . she was transferred to the sas general hospital for further evaluation of some weakness in the setting of multiple medical problems . the patient had o.d. glaucoma surgery , 1400 hours , on may 12th , 1992 . soon after surgery , the patient noted her left lower face and hand were weak . she was brought to the emergency room where she was evaluated and determined to have had a cerebrovascular accident . she has absolutely no neurologic disease in past . the review of systems is negative . however , two days prior to admission , one family member noted that the patient had a transient left facial droop . a potassium three days prior to surgery was 2.8 , the level being normalized with p.o. kay ciel prior to admission . past medical history : the patient has a history of mi in 1989 , no angina before or after . she had a normal exercise thallium test in 08/89 , per ona hospital . the phone no. at the ona hospital is

electrolytes were normal . her admitting hematocrit was 45% , white count 7,700 , with an mcv of 92 , platelets were normal at 263,000 . albumin 2.5 . hospital course : # 1. cerebrovascular accident . the patient suffered some mild weakness which was attributed to stenosis of the distal right internal carotid artery . this was determined by head ct , head mri , head mra , carotid noninvasive studies , transcranial dopplers . the possibility of a cardiac origin was evaluated by echocardiogram and holter monitor . her echocardiogram curiously showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function , a patent foramen ovale , with a trace right to left shunt , as determined by bubble study , trace mr was present . previous echoes have shown mvp at the ona hospital . her holter showed up to 12 beats of svt , but was otherwise unremarkable . the patient had a normal b12 , negative syphilis serologies and normal thyroid function during this hospitalization . she was anticoagulated with heparin and after several days coumadin was started . her exact coumadin dose is undetermined at this point , however it looks like it will be something around 5 mg a day . her pro time and ptt have normalized at the time of discharge . she needs to be given 5 mg of coumadin tonight , 5/22/92 . in addition heparin should be started to drip on arrival at 400 units an hour . it is discontinued at the time of transport . the patient has received physical therapy and occupational therapy and her recovery is near complete . during evaluation of her neurologic status , it was determined that for several months prior to admission , the patient has been too unsteady to ambulate . on our exam she is found to have a significant amount of ataxia , especially in the midline and the exact cause of this is unknown . there are multiple possible contributions and this is where her need for careful internal medical evaluation has arisen . at the time we were to embark on this evaluation , the patient 's family strongly requested that she be transferred to the sas general hospital . what follows is a summary of her medical problems and their possible relationship to her ataxia . her ataxia is likely due to some cerebellar function , though this is not certain . moreover her mri did not show any discrete cerebellar lesions . our leading theory at this point is that her cerebellar dysfunction relates to perineoplastic syndrome , relating to her history of breast ca . as i mentioned above , her evaluation was limited by her cardiologic status at the time . while mammogram and ca-15.3 and breast exam are all normal , the idea of a perineoplastic syndrome with or without concomitant breast ca has reared its head . two possible markers are anti-hu syndrome and anti-yo antibody . these tests were sent on the 18th and are pending at the time of discharge . the results can be obtained by paging me , do a. joasscchird , m.d. at 834-364-2251 . i will be happy to furnish the results . the patient has a history of mi in 1989 . echocardiogram no longer shows wall motion abnormalities . ekg , when the patient goes out of left bundle branch block transiently shows an anterolateral q/wave inversion . we would like to discontinue her isordil to improve upon some orthostatic hypotension , but we are not certain whether her heart will tolerate this . persantine thallium is scheduled at this time , but is yet to be performed . the patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension x many years . it has been evaluated in the past without success . during her hospitalization , we confirmed the presence of this , even when she was hydrated with saline , to a fractional excretion of sodium of 2% . studies of her autonomic system did not document any dysautonomia . studies of skin galvanic conduction were normal and her rr interval evaluation was not abnormal . this is a chronic problem but may be contributing to her current weakness and inability to walk . florinef is to be considered , however stopping the isordil is one goal . the patient has a history of bronchiectasis from a childhood pneumonia . in addition there is a distant history of m. kansasaii infection . this has been evaluated by dr. screen at sas general hospital and probably relates to her lung xray . ct at the ona hospital in 1989 showed similar findings . a chest ct was to be performed and may be yielding . a ppd was placed and is to be read on saturday , 4 26th . the left volar forearm has the ppd just proximal to the wrist crease and a candida albicans placed just distal to the antecubital fossa . the patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis in 1990 , for which she received 6 months of coumadin . dopplers of her lower extremities were negative on this admission . it is doubtful that she has chronic pe , but this is one consideration . it is likely that she has pulmonary hypertension from her lung disease , and so this is a consideration . the patient had mild hyponatremia during this hospitalization with a sodium as low as 131 . we think this is likely due to an siadh as she is euvolemic . this can be evaluated further and is not a problem at this time . the patient has glaucoma . her medications are as listed below . her ophthalmologist is aware of transfer . his name is ettrent can and he can be reached at 678-233-5033 , b 549 .

history of present illness : on 01/03/92 the patient was noted to have nausea and a marked increase in her mild baseline confusion of several years duration . she was transferred to a facility at atl mil , maryland in oakwest on 01/10/92 with a headache , nausea and worsening confusion as well as incomprehensible speech . she was not able to follow commands and had a low grade temperature with a question of a right facial droop . she was then transferred to box memorial hospital nursing home where a lumbar puncture revealed a few red blood cells and white blood cells but also showed marked xanthochromia . she did not reveal any meningismus . the patient was transferred to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital and referred under the care of dr. telshey peg by dr. rerhea t. hearing of box

mevacor and with a history of of calan , ornade and lasix . allergies : there were no known drug allergies . habits : did not include tobacco or alcohol ingestion . physical examination : on physical examination on admission the patient was somnolent but conversant , oriented x 1 only . chest was clear . heart had regular rate and rhythm . neck was supple without mass or bruits . the abdomen was soft and nontender . calves were nontender . on neuro exam the patient was somnolent but readily arousable to conversation . she looked at the examiner and carried an appropriate conversation but only for seconds at a time . her face was strong and symmetric . she felt pin prick and light touch bilaterally to the face symmetrically . her extra ocular movements were full without nystagmus . she sees light only od. which is chronic . she reads large print os. her tongue was midline and her palate elevated symmetrically . she could not maintain her arms long enough to detect drift . she also lifted both legs and flexes at the knees . her grip is 5/5 bilaterally . ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion were 5/5 bilaterally . laboratory data : on admission her labs. were notable for a hematocrit of 41.9 , white blood count 11.1 , mcv 87 , sodium 142 , potassium 3.0 , chloride 101 , bicarb. 29.3 , bun 13 , creatinine 0.9 and sugar 134 . a head ct performed on 01/10/92 revealed no cerebrovascular accident and no evidence of acute blood . mra / mri revealed a left internal carotid artery aneurysm about 7 mm. in width . hospital course : the patient was admitted to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital where a four vessel cerebral angiogram was performed on 01/13/92 . this revealed a lobulated aneurysm at the p. comm. origin on the left . this was a left internal carotid artery aneurysm . the internal carotid arteries and middle cerebral artery showed irregularity of caliber probably due to atherosclerosis . after much discussion , endovascular treatment with gd coils were recommended . the patient underwent coiling on 01/14/92 . this showed that 60-70% of the distal aneurysm was obliterated by the coils . one coil protruded into the lumen of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm . it was thought that the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage was low but still substantial from the untreated proximal lobe . also the risk of ischemia or infarct from the internal carotid artery coil could lead to thromboembolism . therefore the lowest overall risk was thought to be a craniotomy to obliterate the aneurysm and possibly remove the protruding coil . therefore after discussion in detail with sister rora dose , a left pterional craniotomy was performed on 01/15/92 . at this time it was noted that the left internal carotid artery aneurysm was mostly within the cavernous sinus and the extracavernous portion was extremely atherosclerotic . therefore no clip was possible and the patient underwent a muslin wrapping of the aneurysm . the patient postoperatively was able to open her eyes to voice and name . her pupils were equal and reactive and she was able to localize with the left upper extremity as well as raise the right upper extremity above the bed . her consciousness as well as her strength improved gradually and the patient was referred for rehabilitation at a chronic care center . discharge diagnosis : subarachnoid hemorrhage and left internal carotid artery aneurysm . procedures : on 01/13/92 four vessel cerebral angiogram . 01/14/92 embolization of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm . 01/15/92 left pterional craniotomy for left internal carotid artery aneurysm with exploration and muslin wrap of the aneurysm . complications : there were no noted complications . medications on discharge : include heparin

the anterior basilar wall best perfused and an ejection fraction of 18% . there was 3+ mitral regurgitation and reflux into the pulmonary veins in the ------ views . in addition , there was a 60% lesion in the left circumflex artery and only minimal irregularities in the left anterior descending itself . the patient tolerated the procedure well apart from a small rise in his creatinine to 2.3 which returned to his baseline value of approximately 1.7 to 1.9 at the time of discharge after holding his diuretics and his vasodilator medications . the patient was seen in consultation by dr. win shufffyfe of the cardiac surgery service and after a long discussion with the patient , dr. shufffyfe and the patient 's family , it was decided to defer cardiac surgery likely indefinitely and probably permanently given the patient 's age , co-morbidities , lack of probable benefit with relief of his mitral regurgitation , modest aortic stenosis and relatively modest coronary artery disease . while in hospital , the patient was seen by lenni breutzoln who felt that the incremental benefit from biventricular pacing was likely to be modest . the patient also underwent a sleep study which revealed evidence for fairly advanced and severe obstructive sleep apnea with multiple hypopneas and apneas , mean duration of which was approximately 30 seconds with one episodes of 68 seconds with a desaturation to 71% . the patient was fitted with a cpap apparatus with titration of 8-12 cms. of water as tolerated as an outpatient . in addition , the patient had oxygen therapy given his prominent desaturation at night . at the time of discharge , the patient 's vasodilator regimen had been winnowed appreciably and he was discharged with a goal weight of 125 lbs . he will be followed both by

cataract on the fundoscopic examination . neck was supple , bilateral bruits , although possibly radiating from cardiac base . there was no jugular venous distension . chest demonstrated bilateral holosystolic bruits over the subclavians , left greater than right with few bibasilar crackles . cardiovascular examination demonstrated a regular rate and rhythm with 2/6 cresendo / descrecendo murmur heard best at the apex with preservation of the second heart sound , no s3 or s4 . abdominal examination was soft , non-tender , non-distended , positive bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly , no abdominal tenderness . however , there were bilateral bilateral renal bruits and femoral bruits . the patient was guaiac negative per the emergency room . extremities demonstrated no edema . extremity pulses revealed a right radial of 2+ , left radial of 1+ , 2+ distal pulses in the lower extremities bilaterally . lower extremity blood pressures demonstrated systolics of 205-210 . laboratory : laboratory values on admission included a sodium of 142 , potassium 4.8 , chloride 106 , bicarbonate 27 , bun and creatinine of 39 and 1.6 respectively , glucose 113 . calcium was 9.6 .

, negative for alcohol . the patient lives alone , but in a senior living facility adjacent to friends . hospital course : 1 ) cardiovascular : the patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction . she remained on telemetry for greater than 48 hours which demonstrated no dysrhythmia during this time . the patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction with left ventricular hypertrophy and no significant valvular abnormalities . the patient was maintained on her aspirin and lasix . the patient 's diltiazem was stopped due to her increased blood pressure and was started on labetalol which was gradually titrated up to a target blood pressure of 160-170 systolic in her right arm . the patient also underwent an adenosine mibi stress test which showed only mild lateral ischemia . at this time , the patient 's presyncopal symptoms were not felt to be secondary to a cardiovascular etiology . 2 ) neurological / vascular : the discrepancy in the patient 's pulses and blood pressure was felt to be consistent with a subclavian artery stenosis . the patient underwent mri / mra of the head , neck and upper chest which demonstrated a proximal left subclavian artery stenosis , proximal to the take off of the left vertebral artery . the left vertebral artery had a decreased flow consistent with either native vessel disease or some degree of retrograde flow with subclavian steal phenomenon . the patient had patent carotids bilaterally on her neck mra . mri of the head demonstrated a small vessel disease and was likely an old right cerebellar infarct . the patient underwent non-invasive carotid ultrasounds which demonstrated no significant carotid disease . the patient was also noted to have antegrade flow in both of her vertebral arteries bilaterally . the results of these studies suggested that the patient 's symptoms were not due to subclavian steal phenomenon , and therefore , it was decided that the patient would not go further to angio and / or surgical or percutaneous intervention . a neurology consult was obtained and it was felt that the most valuable intervention that could be done for the patient 's intervascular disease would be adequate control of her blood pressure . 3 ) orthopedic : the patient suffered a fall at home with her initial event . outside hip films were obtained , but were not available for view . repeat hip films demonstrated a right sided pubic rami fracture , likely new . an orthopedics consult was obtained and the patient was encouraged to weight bear as tolerated with physical therapy assistance . a bone scan was also obtained to rule out an occult hip fracture which was negative . at the time of this dictation , the patient was able to bear weight with the assistance of physical therapy and a walker . plans were made for the patient to be discharged to dwardmegriff rehabilitation for rehabilitation of her rami fracture . 4 ) gastrointestinal : the patient had an episode of her described vertigo while lying in bed and on the monitor during which no dysrhythmia was noted . the patient also complained of frequent vomiting at least once a day , occasionally associated with ingestion of her medications , but sometimes associated with ambulation . the patient has a long-standing history of spontaneous emesis due to overwhelming stress or excitement . however , the patient reports emesis in the hospital more frequently . the patient 's emesis was noted to be bilious without evidence of new or old blood . the etiology of the patient 's nausea remained unclear as she demonstrated ability to keep down many of her meals which did not suggest an anatomical lesion of her gastrointestinal tract . the patient was started on meclizine on december 31 , 2000 for her nausea and vertigo . an attempt was also made to reduce the patient 's large number of medications and the patient 's os-cal , multivitamin , lasix and colace were discontinued . 5 ) infectious disease : the patient complained of some urinary incontinence and difficulty initiating urine on december 30 , 2000 . urinalysis demonstrated a likely urinary tract infection . the patient was started on levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q. day times seven days for a possible nosocomial urinary tract infection . the urine culture was pending at the time of this dictation . 6 ) fluids , electrolytes and nutrition : the patient had a mild increase in her bun and creatinine during her hospitalization which promptly returned to her baseline levels with intravenous fluids . the patient was encouraged to increase her p.o. intake . dictated by : bone a , m.d. iq35 attending : lanay i. iron , m.d. tj93 yb914/4843 batch : 9056 index no. fpof6to0q7 d : new years eve t : new

{"id": 56, "label": "non-smoker", "text": "principal diagnosis : ruptured parathyroid adenoma . history of present illness : ms. shuffa is a 73-year-old portuguese speaking woman who was transferred via med flight to verg medical center . she arrived intubated and was hemodynamically stable despite concerns of a dissecting aortic arch aneurysm . she initially presented to brottlake medical center on 9/15/00 complaining of acute onset dysphasia to liquids and solids . while she was in brottlake medical center , she developed new onset stridor , and an ent consult was obtained . they attempted a fiberoptic intubation with a # 6 endotracheal tube and found a 5 mm severely compressed airway . she was also found to have a differential systolic blood pressure and ecchymosis on her anterior chest . given these findings , she underwent a ct scan which showed a retrotracheal mass that appeared to obliterate the esophagus . this raised concerns for a hemorrhage , and she was transferred to verg medical center emergently . at the ingree and ot of weamanshy medical center , she underwent an emergent ct scan with iv contrast . this revealed no extravasation of contrast and no aortic aneurysm . however , it did show an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with a density consistent with a hematoma . she was admitted to the thoracic surgery service under the care of dr. sccrookes . past medical history : severe hypertension , angina , gerd , peptic ulcer disease , status post billroth ii , ovarian cancer , status post tah-bso in 1987 with a negative second look laparotomy in 1988 , chronic anemia , chronic left ear infection . medications prior to admission : celexa 10 mg p.o. q.d.; lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.; capoten 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.; pepcid 20 mg p.o. q.d.; cardizem 180 mg p.o. q.d.; xanax 0.5 mg tabs . on transfer , she was on her preadmission medications plus unasyn and tigan 250 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. allergies : no known drug allergies . social history : she is divorced and retired . she lives with her daughter , and denies any tobacco or alcohol use . physical examination : the patient is intubated . vital signs : temperature 98.6 , 66 . right arm was 180/80 , left 188/72 , and a-line was 151/61 . tidal volume is 700 with a rate of 10 , 10 of pressure support , and 10 of peep , and 100% fio2 , satting 100% . general : she was sedated and spontaneously moving all four extremities . neck : edematous . trachea was midline . she had bilateral crepitus in the anterior neck . the superior clavicular area showed no signs of central line access attempts . she had a 3 cm mobile gelatinous well-circumscribed mass in the right supraclavicular region . her anterior neck and chest had a 1 cm to 2 cm area of ecchymosis . lungs : she had bilateral expiratory wheezes . abdomen : soft with good bowel sounds . it was nontender . it was obese with a large midline defect consistent with a ventral hernia , as well as a smaller anterior defect in the left lower quadrant . both were easily reducible . pulse : on the right side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , dp , pt , and radial ; on the left side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , dp , pt , and radial . laboratory data : cbc was 8.7 , 25.3 , and 184 . coags 12.2 , 24.8 , and 1.0 . her gas was 7.47/40/332 . electrolytes were 143 , 3.4 , 105 , 28 , 24 , 3 , and 131 . ekg showed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and incomplete left bundle branch block . ct scan showed an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with air . it was consistent with a hematoma . hospital course : ms. shuffa underwent an egd and flexible bronchoscopy on 9/16/00 shortly after she arrived . this showed tracheal compressions but no other lesions that were obvious at the time . she was hemodynamically stable and remained on the ventilator . the differential diagnoses at this point consisted of hematoma vs. neoplasm vs. an abscess vs. a thyroid tumor . on 9/22/00 , she underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy . a biopsy of this mass was consistent with hematoma . the operative report shows that there was an abnormal area below the trachea to the left which represented a cavity between the esophagus , trachea , aorta , and spine that was full of clot . there was no active bleeding at the time . over the next several days , the patient remained hemodynamically stable on the ventilator . she had an elevated calcium level that raised the suspicion that this mass could be a hematoma coming from a ruptured parathyroid adenoma . the ionized calcium was elevated as was the parathormone level . given these findings , she underwent a sestamibi scan . the sestamibi scan showed findings that were consistent with a parathyroid adenoma in the right lobe of the thyroid . at this time , it was believed that her clot was due to a rupture of this parathyroid adenoma . dr. ear brought the patient to the operating room on 10/5/00 . she underwent a parathyroid exploration with resection of a ruptured ectopic right upper parathyroid adenoma , a biopsy of a normal left and right lower parathyroids , resection of a left upper parathyroid , and tracheostomy . she tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the surgical intensive care unit with her new tracheostomy working well . her postoperative course was complicated by serosanguineous pleural effusion on the left . this required a chest tube . her hematocrit continued to drop over the next couple of days despite normal platelet count , normal coags , and no obvious source of bleeding . it was believed that she was continuing to bleed in her chest . however , we are not quite sure why this was occurring . she underwent an extensive workup by hematology that revealed a bleeding diatheses of unknown etiology . it turns out that several people in her family have a similar bleeding diathesis of unknown etiology . in conclusion , by systems : 1. neuro . the patient became intermittently agitated . we have been giving her haldol at bedtime as well as ativan p.r.n. throughout the day . she responds well to this . she speaks some english and seems to understand more than she speaks . she has a family member who is present for approximately 12 hours each day . she has been very helpful in translating and seems to say that ms. shuffa is in good spirits . 2. cardiac . the patient 's blood pressure has been ranging from approximately 140 to 160 systolic . this is on a current regimen of lopressor 25 mg per ng tube t.i.d. as well as diltiazem 60 mg per ng tube t.i.d. , and lisinopril 10 mg per ng tube q.d. she occasionally gets hypertensive when she is agitated . for this , we have given her 10 mg of hydralazine . her blood pressure responds well to this . otherwise , she is in normal sinus rhythm and has been hemodynamically stable throughout her hospitalization . the patient developed a left femoral artery pseudoaneurysm after placement of a greenfield filter . this has been followed by the vascular surgery service here at the ingree and ot of weamanshy medical center . dr. lenni lung has been consulted . the aneurysm at the time of discharge is approximately 2.5 cm . they elected not to inject it with thrombin . they asked that the patient follow-up with dr. ear in approximately three to four weeks so that this aneurysm can be assessed . they have opted for conservative management given the size . 3. respiratory . at the time of discharge , the patient remained on cpap with a peep of 7.5 and a pressure support of 9 . she seems to be tolerating this well as she has an o2 sat of 100% on 40% fio2 . her chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe hematoma that had greatly improved in the last few days . her right lung field is clear . her tracheostomy is functioning well , and we have had no problems with it . she will obviously need to be weaned as tolerated . we had her down to a low pressure support of 7 in the last week . with the pressure support at 7 , she became tachypneic and had to be brought back up to 10 . her oxygen saturation has always been good . 4. gi . the patient is getting tube feeds via her ng tube of full strength jevity of 75 cc per hour . this is her goal . she tolerates them very well and has approximately 200 cc to 300 cc of stool per day . last week , she had copious amounts of stool in the range of 500 cc to 1000 cc of liquid stool per day . stool cultures have been sent numerous times as well as analysis for c. difficile toxin . these have all been negative . we believe the this was an osmotic diarrhea . since her tube feeds have been changed from full strength nephro to jevity , her diarrhea has resolved . she has been taking zantac , and the ph of her ng tube residuals have been in the 5 to 8 range . 5. gu . the patient has had hypernatremia . she is approximately 10 kg up her overall body weight . we believe her to still be total body overloaded . over the last several days , we have been giving her approximately 500 cc to 1000 cc of free water through her ng tube . we also have been diuresing her with bumex . this seems to trend her sodium down . this will need to be monitored closely . her bun and creatinine have been normal , and she has always made good urine . 6. heme . as stated before , the patient continued to ooze into her pleural space well after her definitive operation . she had an extensive workup by hematology which revealed a bleeding diathesis of unknown origin . before we removed her chest tube , we had to give her platelets . she had no problems with this . at the time of discharge , her hematocrit is stable in the 28 to 33 range . i stress that she cannot be anticoagulated . we have given her lovenox in the past , and she continues to bleed . therefore , she is on no dvt prophylaxis . she does have a left iliac deep vein thrombosis . she has a greenfield filter in place , and this is her only dvt prophylaxis . 7. id . at the time of discharge , the patient has a urinary tract infection . she is growing enterobacter cloacae that is sensitive only to macrodantin from her urine cultures . interestingly enough , she also has enterobacter cloacae growing out of her sputum . this is also sensitive only to macrodantin . we do not believe that she has any respiratory process going on at the time . she is just begun on macrodantin at the day of discharge and should continue 100 mg per ng tube q.i.d. for a ten day course . her foley was changed the day before discharge . 8. tubes , lines , and drains . the patient has a tracheostomy , ng tube , and a foley catheter . her central line , which was left subclavian quad lumen , was removed on the day of discharge . discharge medications : albuterol nebulizers 2.5 mg q.4h. and atrovent nebulizers 0.5 mg q.4h. , please alternate albuterol and atrovent ; rocaltrol 0.25 mcg per ng tube q.d.; calcium carbonate 1250 mg per ng tube q.i.d.; vitamin b12 1000 mcg im q. month , next dose is due nov 18 ;

history of present illness : riie pruesschird is a 25 year-old gentleman with metastatic angiosarcoma who presents as a transfer from nacalv medical center with a fever to 101 , vomiting times one and \" left kidney pain \" . this patient is an unfortunate young gentleman who was initially diagnosed with a germ cell tumor in the fall of 1997 after undergoing orchiectomy with a left scrotal mass and underwent three cycles of dep therapy for pulmonary involvement . in the summer of 1998 he was found to have a retroperitoneal mass which ultimately revealed angiosarcoma of presumed germ-cell transformation . in early 1999 he underwent resection of this mass however in february of 1999 he was found to have a new right pleural mass and subsequently underwent pleurodesis and chemotherapy with ifosfamide and adriamycin for six cycles . in 05/99 he had increasing abdominal pain and evaluation revealed extensive progressive retroperitoneal disease as well as left hydronephrosis . in early 2000 he was started on therapy with taxol per dr. azel hibbskays and finished this in march of this year . ct imaging at that time was negative for disease . in april of this year , he was found to have acute renal failure with left hydronephrosis and this was treated with percutaneous nephrostomy tube on that side . thereafter he began chemotherapy with taxotere in 05/13 and his nephrostomy tube was removed after being displaced on 06/14/00 . most recently he has had problems with nausea , vomiting , fever and left sided abdominal pain and was admitted to the pointexasp region general hospital on 06/16/00 . that hospital course was sign for hydration , antibiotics for questionable pneumonia and more importantly , tachycardia and respiratory distress ultimately secondary to a large left pulmonary arterial mass that was likely a thrombus . he was treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis ( tpa ) and was discharged on 06/28/00 on high dose , low molecular weight heparin . it was entirely clear that this mass represents a clot , certainly this could have been tumor embolization . finally , the patient developed hyponatremia with a sodium down to 130 and was otherwise eventually discharged to pre health with morphine for comfort care and advanced care plans , not to be resuscitated in the event of a life-threatening situation . mr. pruesschird returns tonight after being found to have a temperature of 101 , last evening and early this morning in addition to nausea , vomiting times one earlier today . as well he has complained of some vague left abdominal / flank

{"id": 59, "label": "non-smoker", "text": "principal diagnosis : sternal wound infection . associated diagnoses : infected aortic graft . hypertension . principal procedure : 08/31/98 ascending aortic root replacement with homograft with omentopexy . associated procedures : 09/02/98 sternal debridement . bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flap . right superiorly based rectus abdominis flap . primary closure of wound . history and reason for hospitalization : the patient is a 79 year old gentleman with a history of an ascending aortic graft replacement in 1991 for aortic dissection . at that time the patient 's hospital course was complicated by a sternal wound infection requiring a sternal debridement and subsequent abdominal flap . the patient was then continued by report on dicloxacillin for approximately one year following that reconstructive operation . the patient apparently did well until june 1998 when he noted a bulge in his sternal area . a ruptured aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm at the junction of the graft and arch was diagnosed and this was subsequently repaired . the patient then had recurrent bleeding two weeks later which was once again repaired . however the same problem recurred for a third time and a computer tomogram scan at an outside hospital showed an anterior hematoma . by report the patient was at that time told that there was no more that could be done for him and was then apparently placed on comfort measures and pain control at the outside hospital . however the patient was then subsequently transferred to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital upon request of the family on 8/24/98 for further evaluation and possible intervention . the patient was evaluated by dr. rhalt of dentvailr. medical center . as the patient 's early evaluation the patient underwent an aortogram which showed an ascending aortic graft with bulging flaps and a pseudoaneurysm at the anastomosis of the graft and arch just below the great vessels . there was no evidence for a definite leak but there was evidence for gas bubbles in the anterior posterior distal ends of the grafts consistent with an infectious process . at the same time the patient was seen in consultation by the infectious disease service who upon culturing the patient 's sternal drainage switched the patient from intravenous unasyn to levofloxacin for what appeared to be citrobacter and diphtheroids in the wound cultures . subsequent to starting this antibiotic regimen the patient 's wound drainage appeared to subside . given all the findings on the aortogram and the subsequent chest computer tomogram scan it was discovered that the patient 's only real surgical option for cure was a risky operation that involved removal and replacement of the aortic graft probably with homograft and long term antibiotic coverage as well as a plastic surgical reconstructive procedure . the patient understood the risks and potential benefits of the procedure and was willing to proceed . the patient otherwise complained of no angina , no shortness of breath , no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no edema , no palpitations or symptoms of syncope . he did report a 20 lbs weight loss over the last several months . past medical history : 1. thoracic aneurysm repair . 2. hypertension . 3. status post hernia repair . medications on admission : 1. lopressor 100 mg po three times a day . 2. captopril 75 mg po three times a day . 3. prilosec 20 mg po per day . 4. hydralazine 12.5 mg four times per day . 5. reglan 10 mg po three times a day . allergies : no known drug allergies . family history : noncontributory . social history : the patient was married and denied any tobacco or alcohol use . physical examination : the patient was afebrile , vital signs were stable . head , eyes , ears , nose and throat exam : negative . neck was supple . there was no jugular venous distention . 2+ carotids without bruits . cardiovascular exam : regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 diastolic ___ and a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur . his lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without any evidence for crackles . extremities : the patient had 2+ femoral pulses and 1+ pedal pulses . laboratory and radiologic data : sodium 137 , potassium 4.0 , blood urea nitrogen 16 , creatinine .9 , white blood cell count 4.9 , hematocrit 29.7 , platelet count 207 . the patient 's preoperative chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis . physical examination : the patient 's sternal incision had a superior edge that was dehisced with evidence for stay sutures and some superficial closure sutures exposed . hospital course : the patient was initially admitted to the cardiac surgical service under dr. rhalt . the patient was admitted to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit given the patient 's precarious condition . over the next several hospital days the patient underwent aortogram as well as chest computer tomogram as outlined earlier . the patient was also seen in consultation by the infectious disease service as well as the cardiology service who assisted in managing the patient 's intermittent hypertension . the patient was also seen preoperatively in consultation by the plastic surgical service for potential sternal reconstruction . after lengthy discussions with the patient and the patient 's family as well as the various consultant services it was decided that the patient was a viable candidate for aortic root replacement procedure using homograft . this was obtained on 08/30/98 by dr. niste rhalt of the cardiac surgical service . the patient was then subsequently taken to the operating room on 08/31/98 with the preoperative diagnosis of ascending aortic graft infection . the procedure performed was homograft replacement of the ascending aorta with omentopexy and an open chest . the aortic perfusions were via the femoral artery with venous return by the femoral vein . the cardiopulmonary bypass time was one hour and 49 minutes . the graft used was a homograft . the patient tolerated the procedure fairly well and was transferred intubated to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit with his chest open . the immediate postoperative plans were for a short intensive care unit stay and subsequent plastic surgical reconstruction of the patient 's sternum . the patient was transferred to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit in stable condition . there he continued to be hemodynamically stable . of note , intraoperatively multiple tissue cultures had been sent . in the intensive care unit the patient was kept intubated and sedated until 09/02/98 which was postoperative day no. 1 following the homograft replacement . on that day the plastic surgical service performed further sternal debridement and subsequent reconstruction using bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flaps and right superiorly rectus abdominis flap to cover the patient 's sternal wound with subsequent primary closure of that wound . the patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications . a number of indwelling closed suction drains were left in place so as to drain the bed underneath the muscle flaps . the patient was then transferred back to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit in stable condition . at this point the patient continued to followed by infectious disease service and continued to be on intravenous antibiotics which included vancomycin and levofloxacin . the operating room cultures at that point were positive for crinobactermium with sputum cultures being sensitive for yeast and gram positive cocci in clusters . over the next postoperative day the patient was awakened and weaned to extubate without significant difficulties . the patient 's subsequent postoperative course was characterized by persistent hypertension which required a significant amount of antihypertensives including lopressor 100 mg po three times a day , captopril 100 mg po three times a day , as well as procardia . the patient otherwise continued to do well and was becoming more oriented as time went on and as his blood pressure was brought under control . subsequently on postoperative day no. 8 in the intensive care unit the patient was felt to be ready for transfer to the cardiac surgical inpatient service . the patient continued to be followed by the infectious disease service who felt that the patient 's jackson pratt drains needed to stay in as there was still some significant drainage from them . as per the infectious disease service the patient was continued on levofloxacin , vancomycin as antibiotic coverage . however on 09/08/98 the infectious disease service was made aware that the patient 's intraoperative cultures had also grown out mycoplasma humilius . given this finding it was felt that the patient would certainly need long term intravenous antibiotics to include at least six weeks of vancomycin and then subsequent levofloxacin for the citrobacter and mycoplasma as well . the patient was scheduled for peripherally inserted central catheter line placement knowing that he was going to need long term intravenous antibiotics . this was placed on postoperative day no. 9 without any difficulty . at the same time the patient continued to be stable on his antihypertensive regimen . he was becoming more mobile and was taking a high protein high calories diet which he tolerated well . he continued to be afebrile and otherwise very stable . on postoperative day no. 12 the patient was noted to have fallen and subsequently dislocating the pip joint of his left middle finger . subsequent hand x-rays obtained showed no evidence of fracture but the patient was seen in consultation by the plastic surgery hand service . the patient will benefit from splinting of his finger while the swelling subsided and subsequent early mobilization to prevent any rigidity in that joint . the patient was also seen subsequently in consultation by the plastic surgical service who discontinued a number of the patient 's indwelling drains but they felt that others needed to stay while the patient was sent to rehabilitation . these drains will then be subsequently taken out by dr. general upon his followup with the patient . prior to discharge the patient also underwent an audiogram as a baseline hearing test while the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics . the patient otherwise continued to be hemodynamically stable making good progress . as a matter of fact the patient made remarkable progress given the severity of his disease condition prior to the operation . the patient 's condition continued to be improved . given this finding the patient was therefore felt to be ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on 09/13/1998 . in consultation with the infectious disease service the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics . condition on discharge : good . discharge instructions : diet : high calorie , high protein . the patient 's treatment will include typical peripherally inserted central catheter line care with frequent wound checks . the patient prior to discharge was fitted with an orthoplast finger splint as manufactured by occupational therapy services fairm of ijordcompmac hospital . the patient was also instructed in range of motion exercises for the left middle finger . the patient on discharge is to have twice weekly vancomycin peak and trough levels while he continues on long term vancomycin therapy . the patient was instructed to return to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital if he developed any signs of wound infection such a erythema , drainage , or increasing incisional pain . the patient was instructed to be vigilant for any fevers or chills . medications on discharge : 1. vancomycin 750 mg intravenous q 18h. 2. levofloxacin 500 mg po per day . 3. prilosec 20 mg po per day . 4. captopril 100 mg po three times a day . 5. lopressor 100 mg po three times a day . 6. albuterol nebulizers q6h as needed . 7. atrovent nebulizers q6h as needed . 8. lasix 20 mg po per day . 9. kay-ciel 20 meq po per day . followup : the patient was instructed that he needed to followup with dr. rhalt by calling his office for appointment at 763-6361 subsequent to his discharge to his rehabilitation facility in oaksale lavalle . the patient was also instructed to followup with dr. both of the cardiology service fairm of ijordcompmac hospital following his discharge so that his antihypertension medications could be appropriately adjusted . the patient will also be seen in followup by dr. chpo e. enla general of the plastic surgery service fairm of ijordcompmac hospital so that his indwelling jackson pratt drains be appropriately management and if needed be discontinued by him . the patient will also be followed by the infectious disease service so as to ascertain the exact length and course of his antibiotic therapy . the patient was instructed to followup with dr. naco mesprhalt of the infectious disease service by calling her office for an appointment at 094-902-2879 to be seen in approximately four weeks following the patient 's discharge . dr. dau 's recommendation is that the patient is to stay on vancomycin and levofloxacin for approximately six weeks following discharge and then subsequently on antibiotic regimen for chronic suppression . ryna dau , m.d. dictating for : niste ma rhalt , m.d. tr : oq dd : 09/13/1998 td : 09/13/1998 7:18 a cc : kend n both , m.d.

{"id": 60, "label": "non-smoker", "text": "principal diagnoses : 1 ) thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura . 2 ) bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia . 3 ) renal failure requiring chronic dialysis . history of present illness : the patient is a 63 year-old woman transferred from pre health on june 19 , 1998 to the verg medical center intensive care unit for evaluation of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia . on may 12 , 1998 , the patient presented to pre health with fever , cough , dyspnea and a chest x-ray revealing a patchy infiltrate in the right lung . she was treated with clindamycin and erythromycin which were changed to trovan and then transferred to a hospital . on may 27 , 1998 , the patient desaturated to 40% with a temperature of 100.5 degrees . her oxygen saturations improved to only 92% on 100% face mask and she was admitted to pre health intensive care unit . chest x-ray there revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with increasing pleural effusion . a vq scan was high probability , but no pulmonary angiogram was done and an echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricle with no wall motion abnormality and an ejection fraction of 75% . on may 24 , 1998 , the patient had a ct scan of the chest which revealed diffuse alveolar infiltrates at the right base , mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions . at this point , a diagnosis of lupus was considered and her ana was 1:640 and her rheumatoid factor and anca were negative . she was started on a steroid trial at that point . her pleural fluid was tapped and it was negative for malignancy . on june 11 , 1998 , the patient had a video assisted thoracoscopic study of the right lung which revealed chronic interstitial pneumonitis with a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia-like reaction and a chest tube was placed . the patient was then started on 40 mg of prednisone q. day . from may 27 , 1998 through june 19 , 1998 , the patient had a decline in her platelets from 394 to 28 with a stable hematocrit of 32 to 33 and a rise in creatinine from 1.0 to 3.8 . on june 19 , 1998 , she was transferred to the verg medical center medical intensive care unit for evaluation of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura . past medical history : 1 ) cerebrovascular accident in 1995 in the pontine region secondary to hypertension . 2 ) hypertension . 3 ) status post hysterectomy . 4 ) status post appendectomy . medications on transfer : 1 ) albuterol inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d. 2 ) lasix p.r.n. 3 ) prednisone 40 mg p.o. q. day . 4 ) inderal 40 mg p.o. q.i.d. 5 ) thiamine . 6 ) lasix p.r.n. 7 ) atrovent inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d. 8 ) folic acid . 9 ) premarin 0.625 mg p.o. q. day . 10 ) omeprazole 20 mg p.o. q. day . 11 ) insulin sliding scale . allergies : the patient had no known drug allergies . social history : the patient is divorced . she has two children . she recently retired as a clerical worker . she denies any tobacco . she has only social alcohol use . family history : father died at age 56 of coronary artery disease . mother died at age 68 of pancreatic carcinoma . brother has coronary artery disease . there is no family history of hematologic problems . laboratory : laboratory studies on admission were notable for a sodium of 131 , potassium 6.2 , bun 111 , creatinine 3.9 , white blood cell count 23 , hematocrit 27 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on the smear , platelet count 92 and ldh 496 . hospital course : 1 ) bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia : the video assisted thoracoscopic study at the outside hospital was consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia . the patient was continued on steroids throughout the course of her stay . this was changed to solu-medrol part way through the course due to her hematologic problems , see below . by discharge , she was returned to 40 mg of prednisone q. day times one month to be followed by a slow taper . the patient 's bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia appeared to improve slowly throughout her hospital course , however on july 12 , 1998 , after starting dialysis ( see below ) , the patient desaturated and required supplemental oxygen . repeat chest x-rays and chest ct scans appeared consistent with pulmonary edema from volume overload given her renal failure and eventually , the patient 's pulmonary status did improve after significant volume removal with dialysis for several weeks . at the time of her discharge , the patient was still requiring two liters of supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations in the mid 90% . 2 ) thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura : the patient was initially admitted with platelet count of 28 , hematocrit of 32 , ldh of 496 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on her smear . this was felt to be consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and on june 20 , 1998 , she was started on daily plasma exchange which continued through july 27 , 1999 . she was also changed to intravenous solu-medrol 50 mg q. day which was changed back to 40 mg of prednisone prior to discharge . her platelet count initially rose to a maximum of 159 on july 3 , 1998 , then they steadily fell to a low of 60 on july 20 , 1999 . her ldh which peaked at 1255 decreased to the mid 200s , but remained elevated . she continued to have a few schistocytes on her smear , but it was much decreased . the patient also required red blood cell transfusions , approximately two units every seven to ten days to maintain her hematocrit . eventually , her plasma exchange was tapered to a smaller and smaller dose each day and then discontinued altogether after july 27 , 1999 . after this , the patient 's platelet count rose to a maximum of 177 on discharge . it is felt that the patient 's thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has resolved . she will continue on her prednisone for one month as above for the bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia with a very slow taper . 3 ) renal : the patient presented in acute renal failure with a bun of 101 and a creatinine of 3.7 . throughout the month of june , she had a rising potassium phosphate and increasing volume overload with decreasing response to diuretics and she was finally initiated on dialysis with ultrafiltration on july 12 , 1998 . the opinion of the renal consult was that this was permanent and non-reversible renal failure since it did not improve with dialysis and the patient will continue on dialysis three times per week . she required approximately five liters of ultrafiltration fluid removal at each dialysis session due to her significant volume overload . during the course of her dialysis , she had a great improvement in her lower extremity edema and her oxygen saturation . 4 ) infectious disease : the patient had multiple line infections during her admission including a confirmed coag. negative staphylococcus line infection with positive blood cultures on june 23 , 1998 , july 4 , 1998 , july 8 , 1998 and july 9 , 1998 . the patient eventually had a left subclavian tesio catheter placed and a right brachial picc line placed on july 10 , 1998 which remained patent and uninfected . she received a full three week course of vancomycin and also received a three week course of ceftazidime . in addition , she had a fungal urinary tract infection treated with amphojel bladder irrigation , which was followed by a klebsiella urinary tract infection for which she received levofloxacin times fourteen days . she also received a fourteen day course of acyclovir which was begun on june 21 , 1998 for perianal lesions consistent with herpes simplex virus . she was also on fluconazole for some oral thrush which was inadvertently continued for a total of thirty days . the patient was also started on bactrim one double strength tablet q.o.d. as prophylaxis for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while on her high dose steroids . 5 ) rheumatology : the patient was admitted with a question of lupus given her ana of 1:640 although her rheumatoid factor and anca were negative . unfortunately throughout her admission , we were unable to test any more titers since she was receiving daily plasma exchange . a repeat ana , rheumatoid factor and anca may be repeated as an outpatient . follow-up : 1 ) the patient will follow-up with her primary care physician , dr. tamarg study , in arvus after she is discharged from rehabilitation . 2 ) the patient is being discharged to a hospital where she will receive onsite hemodialysis three times per week on monday , wednesday and friday . the nephrologist who will follow her there is dr. study . 3 ) the patient will continue to have her cbc , ldh , bilirubin , chem-7 and magnesium and calcium checked with each dialysis and the results will be faxed to dr. ian zineisfreierm , the hematology attending at fax number 751-329-8840 . 4 ) the patient will eventually need a permanent dialysis fistula . the left subclavian tesio which she has in place will last for several months in the mean time . she would like to arrange to have her fistula placed at pre health and the vascular surgeons there should be contacted regarding this . 5 ) the patient will need packed red blood cell transfusions with dialysis when her hematocrit falls below 26 . 6 ) the patient will continue her prednisone at 40 mg p.o. q. day times one month ( this was started on july 27 , 1999 ) and then she will begin a slow taper as guided by pulmonary . 7 ) the patient has a follow-up appointment in the pulmonary clinic with dr. cedwi stone at 336-2931 on august 30 , 1999 at 1:40 pm . 8 ) the patient has a follow-up appointment with dr. ian zineisfreierm at the we

{"id": 71, "label": "past-smoker", "text": "date of birth ; september 30 , 1917 principal diagnosis : left anterior temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage . associated diagnosis : atrial fibrillation , deep venous thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , right frontal infarct , hypertension , and question progressive supranuclear palsy . principal procedure : magnetic resonance imaging of the brain on 10/18/96 . ther procedures : arterial catheterization on 10/14/96 , head ct scan on 10/14/96 history and reason for hospitalization : granrivern call is a 79-year-old right handed white male with a history of questionable progressive supranuclear palsy , atrial fibrillation , deep venous thrombosis , and pulmonary embolus who presents with a change in mental status and a fall at home . his family stated that he had a progressive mental decline over the past three years and was initially diagnosed with parkinson 's disease or features consistent with parkinsonism . this was poorly responsive to eldopa . he was later seen by dr. flo cuchkote at the ph university of medical center and diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy . over the five to six weeks prior to admission he had a drop off in his mental functioning with more frequent episodes of confusion and disorientation and requiring more assistance with his activities of daily living . he also developed a urinary incontinence . he had had two falls to his wife 's recollection , both times slipping off the edge of a chair backwards . on the morning of admission at 8 o'clock , he was noted to be moving his mouth less and speaking \" gibberish \" . he was later sitting in a chair making multiple attempts to get up , which he subsequently did and promptly fell directly on his face at approximately 11:30 a.m. there was no definite clonic activity . there was no known incontinence . he was taken to an outside hospital and nasally intubated and then transferred to the ph university of medical center emergency room where he was orally intubated . a trauma evaluation was negative and thus he was transferred to the neurology service . medications on admission : coumadin 4 mgs po qhs , vasotec 5 mgs po qd , lasix prn , digoxin 0.25 mgs poqd , proscar and sinemet . allergies : no known drug allergies . past medical history : 1) atrial fibrillation on coumadin , 2) deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus ; the wife states since he was in the infantry in world war ii . 3) question progressive supranuclear palsy . 4) old right frontal infarct . 5) hypertension . social history : he lives with his wife who is his primary care giver . he is a former professor at montana . tobacco ; he has some distant history of some very minimal use . alcohol ; he has no recent use . he was a previous drinker of one \" old fashioned \" every night . family history : he has a father who had dementia . there was no history of strokes or bleeding disorders in the family . physical examination : vital signs in the emergency room were 210/100 for blood pressure , heart rate 70 and irregular . he was afebrile . in general he was an intubated elderly frail appearing white male with blood about his face . head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination ; abrasions about his forehead , there was some minimal swelling associated . his neck was rigid ; 1+ carotids without bruits . oropharynx was intubated with blood as well . lungs ; clear to auscultation bilaterally . cardiovascular examination ; regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops . abdominal examination ; soft , non-tender , non-distended , normal active bowel sounds . extremities : no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema . neurologically ; he opens his eyes to voice . he does not regard the examiner . he had no blink to threat . his pupils were three down to two on the right and five down to four on the left . according to the family this iansicoria was old . he had intact corneals bilaterally and intact horizontal dull movements bilaterally . he had left greater than right nasal stimulation to grimace . he had no gag to tube manipulation . motor examination he had a weak withdrawal to nail bed pressure in both hands . he triple flexed his bilateral lower extremities to pain . his deep tendon reflexes were 2+ at the right brachial radialis and right patella ; everywhere else his reflexes were 1 . his toes were down going . summary of laboratory and radiological examinations : sodium 141 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 107 , bicarbonates 23.8 , bun 23 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 165 , po2 377 , pco2 32 , ph 7.50 , asomus 298 , toxic screen negative , white blood cell count 11.1 , hematocrit 39.6 , platelet count 137 , prothrombin time 25.2 , inr 4.3 , partial thromboplastin time 34.7 , urinalysis 1+ albumin, 0-5 high link caths , cervical spine negative , pelvis negative , lumbar spine ; negative , thoracic spine negative . chest x-ray clear . electrocardiogram showed 2 mm of st depressions in v4-6 . head ct scan showed a 2 x 2 x 2 left anterior temporal hemorrhage with minimal surrounding edema . there was also evidence of an old right frontal infarction . hospital course and treatment : 1) neurology : the patient was admitted to the neurology intensive care unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition . he had an electroencephalogram performed on his initial admittance to the intensive care unit which did not show any evidence of seizure activity . it did , however , show diffuse slowing . he was given 1.5 grams of dilantin in the emergency room as well as 2 mgs of intravenous ativan which did little to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination . his hypertension ; his high blood pressure was controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine in the early going and then he was switched to an oral regimen for better control after he was removed from the intensive care unit . he continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his ability to move . he did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right , but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission . his diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was placed under question on further examination of his eye movement since he was able to have excellent superior gaze especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy . it was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process , but this was not clarified during this admission . it was not felt likely to be due to parkinson 's disease , as he had no significant response to eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of tremor , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic . he had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on october 18 , 1996 . this showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct , but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy . in addition , he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage , so tumor was felt to be unlikely . however , this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage . the etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out . 2) cardiovascular : his electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia . he was on intravenous tng and was supratherapeutic on his anti-coagulation . he did have a slight elevation of his tpk with an additional value of 198 with a mb fraction of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2.9 . that was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent ckmbs and was felt that he had a very small \" leaflet \" . he remained chest pain free throughout his admission . 3) pulmonary : after his initial intubation he remained quite stable . he was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex . however , he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission . 4) hematology : he had his prothrombin time reversed with vitamin k 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room . his anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation , but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed . it was decided that his goal inr was to be 2.0 . he did drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period , but his discharge inr was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time . it was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems . 5) gastrointestinal : he was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the ph university of medical center and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision . thus , his nasogastric tube was discontinued on october 19 , 1996 and he tolerated feeding quite well . in discussions with the family , given his age and number of medical problems , it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have a terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions . however , he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be a short term procedure . the family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good , but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary , short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest . disposition / plan on discharge : stable . doctor 's discharge orders : the patient was to be discharged to

disease 5. bronchitis 6. cervical polyps chief complaint : the patient is a 55 year old white female with dilated cardiomyopathy , status post ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest 02/04/94 . she was transferred to retelk county medical center for further therapy , and transplant evaluation . patient also received aicd . history of present illness : the patient was initially admitted for further therapy of her idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and for transplant evaluation . patient 's past medical history is to besummarized as follows : in 1990 the patient was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy in hispit , delaware . since that time the patient has been treated medically . in 07/93 the patient underwent exercise tolerance test which showed a mbo2 of 12.7 mg per kilogram . on 09/93 the patient underwent transplant evaluation at retelk county medical center . echocardiogram showed severe pr and mitral regurgitation , mild ai and ejection fraction of 15% to 20% , a markedly dilated left ventricle and moderately dilated right ventricle , and a question of a possible left ventricular and right ventricular thrombus . consequently the patient was started on coumadin . catheterization at that time showed an ra pressure of 60 , cardiac index of 1.7 , svr of 2100 and a pvr of 387 . coronaries were completely normal . consequently the patient was admitted to the ccu for intensive hemodynamic monitoring , and after load reduction . in the ccu the patient was initially treated with nitroprusside and eventually switched to captopril and isordil . hemodynamics were optimized resulting in a cardiac output of 4.4 with a svr of 1300 and a wedge of 16 . pulmonary function tests were obtained which showed marked pulmonary dysfunction with fev1 of 1.4 and markedly decreased elcl of 50% . repeat pulmonary function tests following optimization of cardiac therapy showed somewhat improved but not to a significant degree of the pulmonary function tests . furthermore , due to the patient 's long standing amiodarone therapy , and a positive second pulmonary function , amiodarone was discontinued during that hospital admission . consequently the patient was discharged on captopril , digoxin , lasix , micronase , isordil and prn inhalers . the patient did well at home until 1/31/94 when she was admitted to souland in nixmont bovo with increasing congestive heart failure . at that time the patient was aggressively diuresed . by report , in the interim since discharge from retelk county medical center , amiodarone was restarted for unclear indications . dring this hospitalization at hahkellrick hospital , a dobutamine drip was started to improve hemodynamics , and in the setting of the dobutamine drip the patient had spontaneous ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest . she was quickly defibrillated and converted to sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block . she was treated for a short time with lidocaine and eventually weaned off . she was continued on low dose dobutamine and transferred back to retelk county medical center for further evaluation . the patient was transferred to retelk county medical center on 02/20/94 , again for possible heart-lung transplantation . the patient was evaluated by the chf and heart transplant service . it was felt that the patient was not likely a good transplant candidate secondary to endocurrent lung disease . furthermore , since it was felt that the patient failed amiodarone therapy , the patient was seen by the alllo eino hospital which recommended eps to rule out possible bundle branch reentry as the source of the patient 's arrhythmia with possible aicd placement if the eps was negative . note , per recommendation from the chf team , dobutamine was discontinued within the first 24 hours of the patient 's hospitalization without difficulty . on 02/22/94 an eps study was performed . the patient was negative for inducible ventricular arrhythmias despite maximal stimulation . consequently aicd placement was recommended . consequently , the patient underwent aicd placement on 03/09/94 . note , from 02/22 to 03/09 there is a question of the patient having a right forearm thrombophlebitis . consequently , the patient underwent a full 2 week course of antibiotic therapy along with debridement of the right forearm for placement of the aicd . note , biopsies from the right forearm were significant only for inflammation , and not infection . cultures were negative , and note , no pus or purulent fluid was found upon debridement . thus , aicd placement was performed on 03/09/94 following a 2 week course of antibiotic therapy for presumed ( but later found to be inflammation only ) of right forearm phlebitis . there were no intraoperative or postoperative complications following the aicd placement . by 03/10/94 the patient was able to ambulate without assistance , and was only having minimal tenderness at the aicd placement site . at this point it was felt the patient would go home on 03/13/94 . it was felt that the patient should stay inhouse over the weekend since the patient will be traveling back to vonamemp , la via plane by herself . this was discussed with both the patient and the cardiology b team . past medical history : type ii diabetes mellitus , cardiomyopathy , bronchitis , history of hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and cervical polyps . allergies : nkda . medications on transfer : captopril 25 mg t.i.d. , digoxin .125 mg q.d. , lasix 40 mg q.d. , isordil 10

mentioned in the history of present illness ( inadvertently placed in the history of present illness ) , the patient was admitted for further management , and evaluation of transplantation . as per history of present illness the patient was found to be a poor heart-lung transplantation candidate . an eps study was performed which was negative for inducible arrhythmia despite maximal stimulus . consequently , the patient underwent aicd placement on 03/09/94 . hospital course was only complicated by presumed right forearm thrombophlebitis , and the patient completed a 2 week antibiotic course prior to aicd placement . note , for the question of the right forearm thrombophlebitis , the right forearm was debrided and sent for culture and pathology . cultures were negative . debridement was negative for purulent discharge . pathology is only significant for inflammation , and not infection . the patient did well following the aicd placement . there were no intraoperative complications ,
