oxygen saturation . she was aggressively diuresed for her minimal congestive heart failure . 5. gastrointestinal : the patient had guaiac positive stools and had an elevated amylase without an elevated lipase . these findings suggest some bowel pathology . the patient is known to have had an upper gastrointestinal bleed in 1997 in the context of coumadin . an outpatient gastrointestinal workup may be indicated . 6. renal : the patient maintained her baseline creatinine which reflects chronic renal insufficiency secondary to her diabetes . 7. infectious disease : the patient was treated on unasyn for concern of cellulitis . the patient 's lower extremities were bilaterally erythematous consistent with chronic venous stasis . however she did have a low grade temperature to 100f and it was thought that given her diabetes and ulcer on her heel she should be covered for possible cellulitis . she will be discharged on a one week course of augmentin . the patient was

present illness : ms. tikrhalt is an 86 year old female , previously healthy , who presents with a 3 month history of dysphagia . a subsequent workup including upper gastrointestinal series and abdominal computerized tomography scan suggested the presence of a gastric mass . endoscopy with biopsy revealed gastric carcinoma , poorly differentiated , within the body of the stomach along the greater curvature . she was subsequently referred to dr. ko for a possible resection of this carcinoma . she reports a 10 pound weight loss over the past several months . she denies any abdominal pain . past medical history : significant for an appendectomy in the distant past , cholecystectomy in the past , history of of cesarean section in the past and a history of near total thyroidectomy for nodular goiter in the past . medications on admission : her only medication is thyrolar for her relative hypothyroidism following resection . there is a question of an allergy to tylenol . she denies any history of hypertension , diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease or peptic ulcer disease . interestingly , she reports that both her mother and father died of stomach carcinoma . she is a former smoker , and drinks alcohol occasionally . physical examination : on physical examination she is an elderly but spry white female in no acute distress . her sclera were nonicteric . her oropharynx was clear . her neck was supple without masses or bruits noted . her lungs were clear to auscultation . her cardiac examination was unremarkable . examination of her abdomen revealed a flat nontender abdomen without palpable masses . there were multiple well healed surgical scars . she was guaiac negative . there was no cva tenderness or spinal tenderness noted . her pulses were intact throughout . laboratory data : sodium 139 , potassium 3.7 and bun of 19 . her hematocrit was 37.2 with a white blood count of 6.6 . her bilirubin direct and total were 0.1 and 0.3 respectively . her alkaline phosphatase was 134 . her electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm without acute ischemic changes . chest x-ray was unremarkable . the assessment at the time of admission was that of an 86 year old female with poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma , admitted for resection . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the service of dr. fede a. duhenile . on 1/12/92 she was taken to the operating room where she underwent a neart total gastrectomy with a retrocolic bill-roth ii gastrojejunostomy reconstruction . in addition a small ventral hernia was noted upon abdominal exploration within a previous surgical incision . this was repaired . a needle jejunostomy catheter was placed at the time of her operation to facilitate postoperative nutrition . with regards to the cancer , there was a large mass along the greater curvature in the body of the stomach , and several perigastric lymph nodes which were taken with the specimen . in addition , there were at least two lymph nodes within the porta hepatis which were dissected free and taken en bloc with the specimen . the remainder of her abdomen was unremarkable without evidence of metastatic

cmv . a repeat cat scan of the sinuses with finding of progressive thickening of the left maxillary sinus and both sets of ethmoid air cells since prior study of november 9 , indicating progressive infection of acanthamoeba and any possible superinfection with bacterial sinusitis . in the days following admission , there was clear evidence for progression of erythematous nodules over both arms and right thigh at foci of acanthamoeba infection , suggesting progressive skin involvement with acanthamoeba . infectious disease consult was obtained and recommendation was to switch from voriconazole to itraconazole , on which there was more existing data on treatment of acanthamoeba infection . pentamidine intravenous and nasal washings were continued . clinical progression of skin and sinus infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy continued , with emergence on november 20 of a new right-sided ptosis in association with a left homonymous hemianopsia , and fleeting confusion while febrile , prompting head mri which revealed a large 5 x 2 x 4.3 cm region in the right occipital lobe of hemorrhage and edema , with dural and , likely , leptomeningeal enhancement in association with small foci in the right cerebellum and pons , concerning for early lesions of similar type . idiosyncratic reaction to cyclosporine was considered as cause for cerebritis , and cyclosporine was discontinued . however , much more likely explanation is progressive infection of acanthamoeba with new neurologic involvement . most likely source of fevers was judged to be progressive acanthamoeba infection , even on maximal antimicrobial therapy . a single blood culture positive for coagulase negative staphylococcus was treated with a course of vancomycin in the setting of a picc line and a chest x-ray on november 20 indicating possible developing pneumonia , resulted in a course of levofloxacin , for both possible pneumonia , as well as treatment of any bacterial superinfection of acanthamoeba sinusitis . patient experienced steady decline , with persistent fevers despite all above measures , progressive areas of skin infection , more frequent episodes of confusion , and decreasing oxygen saturation in the setting of bilateral effusion , in the setting of fluid surge spacing . on november 30 , a family meeting with patient 's daughter and spouse , along with primary oncologist , dr. tomedankell bile , attending physician , dr. mellerny close , and house staff , was held to discuss patient 's critical condition and inability to prevent progression of skin , sinus and neurological acanthamoeba infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy . decision was made to withdraw aggressive measures of care , with priority on patient 's comfort . pentamidine , itraconazole , levaquin , acyclovir and gcsf were discontinued , along with other medications nonessential to patient 's comfort . dnr / dni status initially established early during hospital stay remained in effect . the patient was made comfortable with morphine for pain and for air hunger , and sinus suctioning was continued to relieve congestion , in conjunction with continuation of nasal sprays . tylenol was continued to control fevers and prednisone was continued to control inflammation and prevent precipitation of adrenal insufficiency . such measures have been continued through december 3 , and patient remains comfortable through this time . this interim dictation to be followed by an addendum detailing end of hospital course . dictated by : shaa kacholera

on 9/15/00 complaining of acute onset dysphasia to liquids and solids . while she was in brottlake medical center , she developed new onset stridor , and an ent consult was obtained . they attempted a fiberoptic intubation with a # 6 endotracheal tube and found a 5 mm severely compressed airway . she was also found to have a differential systolic blood pressure and ecchymosis on her anterior chest . given these findings , she underwent a ct scan which showed a retrotracheal mass that appeared to obliterate the esophagus . this raised concerns for a hemorrhage , and she was transferred to verg medical center emergently . at the ingree and ot of weamanshy medical center , she underwent an emergent ct scan with iv contrast . this revealed no extravasation of contrast and no aortic aneurysm . however , it did show an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with a density consistent with a hematoma . she was admitted to the thoracic surgery service under the care of dr. sccrookes . past medical history : severe hypertension , angina , gerd , peptic ulcer disease , status post billroth ii , ovarian cancer , status post tah-bso in 1987 with a negative second look laparotomy in

spontaneously moving all four extremities . neck : edematous . trachea was midline . she had bilateral crepitus in the anterior neck . the superior clavicular area showed no signs of central line access attempts . she had a 3 cm mobile gelatinous well-circumscribed mass in the right supraclavicular region . her anterior neck and chest had a 1 cm to 2 cm area of ecchymosis . lungs : she had bilateral expiratory wheezes . abdomen : soft with good bowel sounds . it was nontender . it was obese with a large midline defect consistent with a ventral hernia , as well as a smaller anterior defect in the left lower quadrant . both were easily reducible . pulse : on the right side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , dp , pt , and radial ; on the left side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , dp , pt , and radial . laboratory data : cbc was 8.7 , 25.3 , and 184 . coags 12.2 , 24.8 , and 1.0 . her gas was 7.47/40/332 . electrolytes were 143 , 3.4 , 105 , 28 , 24 , 3 , and 131 . ekg showed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and incomplete left bundle branch block . ct scan showed an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with air . it was consistent with a hematoma . hospital course : ms. shuffa underwent an egd and flexible bronchoscopy on 9/16/00 shortly after she arrived . this showed tracheal compressions but no other lesions that were obvious at the time . she was hemodynamically stable and remained on the ventilator . the differential diagnoses at this point consisted of hematoma vs. neoplasm vs. an abscess vs. a thyroid tumor . on 9/22/00 , she underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy . a biopsy of this mass was consistent with hematoma . the operative report shows that there was an abnormal area below the trachea to the left which represented a cavity between the esophagus , trachea , aorta , and spine that was full of clot . there was no active bleeding at the time . over the next several days , the patient remained hemodynamically stable on the ventilator . she had an elevated calcium level that raised the suspicion that this mass could be a hematoma coming from a ruptured parathyroid adenoma . the ionized calcium was elevated as was the parathormone level . given these findings , she underwent a sestamibi scan . the sestamibi scan showed findings that were consistent with a parathyroid adenoma in the right lobe of the thyroid . at this time , it was believed that her clot was due to a rupture of this parathyroid adenoma . dr. ear brought the patient to the operating room on 10/5/00 . she underwent a parathyroid exploration with resection of a ruptured ectopic right upper parathyroid adenoma , a biopsy of a normal left and right lower parathyroids , resection of a left upper parathyroid , and tracheostomy . she tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the surgical intensive care unit with her new tracheostomy working well . her postoperative course was complicated by serosanguineous pleural effusion on the left . this required a chest tube . her hematocrit continued to drop over the next couple of days despite normal platelet count , normal coags , and no obvious source of bleeding . it was believed that she was continuing to bleed in her chest . however , we are not quite sure why this was occurring . she underwent an extensive workup by hematology that revealed a bleeding diatheses of unknown etiology . it turns out that several people in her family have a similar bleeding diathesis of unknown etiology . in conclusion , by systems : 1. neuro . the patient became intermittently agitated . we have been giving her haldol at bedtime as well as ativan p.r.n. throughout the day . she responds well to this . she speaks some english and seems to understand more than she speaks . she has a family member who is present for approximately 12 hours each day . she has been very helpful in translating and seems to say that ms. shuffa is in good spirits . 2. cardiac . the patient 's blood pressure has been ranging from approximately 140 to 160 systolic . this is on a current regimen of lopressor 25 mg per ng tube t.i.d. as well as diltiazem 60 mg per ng tube t.i.d. , and lisinopril 10 mg per ng tube q.d. she occasionally gets hypertensive when she is agitated . for this , we have given her 10 mg of hydralazine . her blood pressure responds well to this . otherwise , she is in normal sinus rhythm and has been hemodynamically stable throughout her hospitalization . the patient developed a left femoral artery pseudoaneurysm after placement of a greenfield filter . this has been followed by the vascular surgery service here at the ingree and ot of weamanshy medical center . dr. lenni lung has been consulted . the aneurysm at the time of discharge is approximately 2.5 cm . they elected not to inject it with thrombin . they asked that the patient follow-up with dr. ear in approximately three to four weeks so that this aneurysm can be assessed . they have opted for conservative management given the size . 3. respiratory . at the time of discharge , the patient remained on cpap with a peep of 7.5 and a pressure support of 9 . she seems to be tolerating this well as she has an o2 sat of 100% on 40% fio2 . her chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe hematoma that had greatly improved in the last few days . her right lung field is clear . her tracheostomy is functioning well , and we have had no problems with it . she will obviously need to be weaned as tolerated . we had her down to a low pressure support of 7 in the last week . with the pressure support at 7 , she became tachypneic and had to be brought back up to 10 . her oxygen saturation has always been good . 4. gi . the patient is getting tube feeds via her ng tube of full strength jevity of 75 cc per hour . this is her goal . she tolerates them very well and has approximately 200 cc to 300 cc of stool per day . last week , she had copious amounts of stool in the range of 500 cc to 1000 cc of liquid stool per day . stool cultures have been sent numerous times as well as analysis for c. difficile toxin . these have all been negative . we believe the this was an osmotic diarrhea . since her tube feeds have been changed from full strength nephro to jevity , her diarrhea has resolved . she has been taking zantac , and the ph of her ng tube residuals have been in the 5 to 8 range . 5. gu . the patient has had hypernatremia . she is approximately 10 kg up her overall body weight . we believe her to still be total body overloaded . over the last several days , we have been giving her approximately 500 cc to 1000 cc of free water through her ng tube . we also have been diuresing her with bumex . this seems to trend her sodium down . this will need to be monitored closely . her bun and creatinine have been normal , and she has always made good urine . 6. heme . as stated before , the patient continued to ooze into her pleural space well after her definitive operation . she had an extensive workup by hematology which revealed a bleeding diathesis of unknown origin . before we removed her chest tube , we had to give her platelets . she had no problems with this . at the time of discharge , her hematocrit is stable in the 28 to 33 range . i stress that she cannot be anticoagulated . we have given her lovenox in the past , and she continues to bleed . therefore , she is on no dvt prophylaxis . she does have a left iliac deep vein thrombosis . she has a greenfield filter in place , and this is her only dvt prophylaxis . 7. id . at the time of discharge , the patient has a urinary tract infection . she is growing enterobacter cloacae that is sensitive only to macrodantin from her urine cultures . interestingly enough , she also has enterobacter cloacae growing out of her sputum . this is also sensitive only to macrodantin . we do not believe that she has any respiratory process going on at the time . she is just begun on macrodantin at the day of discharge and should continue 100 mg per ng tube q.i.d. for a ten day course . her foley was changed the day before discharge . 8. tubes , lines , and drains . the patient has a tracheostomy , ng tube , and a foley catheter . her central line , which was left subclavian quad lumen , was removed on the day of discharge . discharge medications : albuterol nebulizers 2.5 mg q.4h. and atrovent nebulizers 0.5 mg

procedures : radiation therapy to the right clavicle 07/16/2004 . history of present illness : one of several puomc admissions for this 88-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer initially diagnosed in 1997 and treated with surgery , radiation , and hormonal treatment . she had actually completed her five years of tomaxifin , but was continuing to be plagued by menopausal symptoms and finally in the summery of 2004 understanding the obvious potential risks , she began an estrogen patch . not long afterwards she began to develop some bone pains which progressed over the late summer and fall requiring escalation of opiates and restaging confirmed the presence of metastases throughout her spine and in the base of her skull , ribs , arms , etc ... but no visceral involvement . she ultimately was admitted to the hospital because of delirium and difficulty controlling the pain . she had no fevers , chills , headaches , or neck stiffness . there had been no focal neurologic changes . up until this admission she had been relatively independent and was very dismayed to discover the extensive relapse of her disease . on admission to the hospital her temperature was 99 , heart rate 99 , blood pressure 151/87 , o2 saturation on room air was 92% . she did look mildly dyspneic . her lungs were clear . she had good range of motion throughout except for severe local tenderness and swelling on the mid third of her right clavicle which impaired right shoulder movement . she was oriented to place and name and this waxed and waned over the next couple of days . the rest of her neurologic exam was essentially intact . laboratory data : sodium of 137 , bun of 25 , creatinine of 0.9 , glucose of 77 , calcium slightly high at 10.9 with an albumin of 3.7 . bilirubin normal . her alt 11 , her ast slightly up at 59 . her alk phos slightly up at 174 . wbc 10.8 with normal differential . hemoglobin 12.2 , hematocrit 36.6 , mcv 89 , platelets 345,0000 . a urinalysis showed cloudy urine with 10-20 red cells and 20-50 white cells . a ca 153 was significantly elevated at 66.5 ( normal 0-30 ) . the patient was brought to the floor , hydrated gently , given another dose of zomaten to help with her calcium and over the next few days remained relatively lethargic while we held some of her long acting opiates . she gradually began to improve and was able to tell if the worst pain was in the right clavicle . this was assessed promptly by an x-ray that confirmed pathologic fracture of that site . she also went on to have cervical , thoracic , and lumbosacral mris to confirm the wide spread bony metastases in the vertebral bodies and old degenerative changes perhaps with some indentation of the thecal sac but with no radiologic evidence for cord compression . she had had some urinary hesitancy and difficulty moving her legs in the first few days that had lead to the concern to _________ quinine syndrome but as soon as the opiates were tapered down she was able to void spontaneously and soon began to ambulate with the help of physical therapy . a single fraction to the collar bone seemed to help with pain . her bowels required fairly heavy duty osmotic laxatives to keep them open . the sudden plunge in such a dependent state left her quite depressed and ultimately a small dose of dexedrine was started partly to overcome the sedation of the opiates and perhaps improve her mood since more traditional antidepressants would take four to six weeks . plan : escalate the doses of the dexedrine perhaps up to a maximum of 10 mg at 8 o'clock in the morning and another 10 mg around noon and see if she can get reasonable sleep at night on this schedule , adding on remeron at night time for sleep as an antidepressant would be a possibility or to go right to a conventional ssri overlap until it seems to show more affect . she lives with her elderly husband and he was appropriately overwhelmed by the prospect of caring for her single-handedly , hence the transfer to a skilled nursing facility for a week or two of rehab . the patient and husband clearly expressed during this visit that she would not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation and ventilator support in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest . she was begun on letrazole as an ____________ inhibitor for her breast cancer and discussions were begun to consider a possible course or two of xeloda perhaps at a dose reduced scheduled if she continues to make progress in rehab and can return to dr. first 's office to have further discussions of this later approach

shoulder and , in fact , there was a lytic lesion involving the right shoulder and femur . plain film revealed a moth-eaten appearance consistent with probable new metastases . the radiation service was consulted and noted that past areas treated including her right femur , her thoracic spine , pelvis , and right posterior ribs had all responded to radiation therapy and agreed that treating the right shoulder humerus and the right hip which had not been previously treated was reasonable . planning for further radiation therapy was arranged for next week by the radiation service . she was

left lung with scattered nodules in the right upper lung . these nodules are confirmed by chest ct and demonstrated to be smaller than 3 millimeter peripheral nodules appearing in both lung apices . the ct also demonstrated questionable right hepatic hemangioma and multiple tubular hypodensities were hepatic veins should be . hospital course and treatment : because of the extensiveness of ms. abreun 's hospital course it will be organized by system : 1. neurological : on admission the patient was intubated and sedated . her sedation was gradually weaned during her first month in the intensive care unit and she was noted to have an underlying depression and history of obsessive compulsive disorder as listed from the patient and her family . a psychiatric evaluation was obtained and she was placed on paxil at 5 milligrams which was gradually increased to a total of 20 milligrams po q day at the time of her admission . on august 29th , ms. abreun again required sedation when she found apneic and hypotensive . she spent several days in the intensive care unit at that time , during which her sedation was gradually weaned back to off . 2. pulmonary : ms. abreun was admitted , sedated and on a respirator , requiring minimal settings with a pressure support of 10 and a pep of 5 . after two weeks of intubation on july 25th the patient went to the operating room for a tracheostomy which she tolerated without issue . over the next several weeks , the ventilatory support was gradually weaned to off . by august 9th she was tolerating trach mask trials and was on the verge of tracheostomy removal by august 29th . at this time , she had a sudden episode of respiratory distress accompanied by hypotension and unresponsiveness . she was bag masked and taken immediately to the intensive care unit where she was placed on respiratory support with simv settings which were gradually weaned over the course of her ten days in the intensive care unit . after her wean from the respiratory , she was transferred back to the floor and over the next several days tolerated trach mask trials admirably and had her tracheostomy removed on september 16th , 1998 . at the time of her discharge , she had no acute respiratory issues . 3. cardiovascular : ms. abreun was admitted on cardiac support requiring 30 of neo-synephrine . she was placed on a swan gans catheter monitor and gradually weaned off the neo-synephrine by the 22nd of july . she required no further support and had no further issues until august 29th when she had her respiratory crisis and was transferred to the unit . at this time her dramatic pressure drop required dopamine support at levels of 500 micrograms per minute . a swan gans catheter floated at this time demonstrated an svr of 500 . she was supported with dopamine and with fluid and was slow to come off the dopamine requiring approximately 8 to 10 days for full weaning . after the wean she required no further cardiac medication and had no further issues . 4. renal : ms. abreun 's fluid management was an important contributor to her hospital course . she presented with massive ascites and anasarca for which she received large volume diuresis with regular lasix dosing daily . renal parameters were normal until the time of her respiratory cardiovascular crisis on august 29th . at this time , it was noted that her bun jumped to levels of approximately 80 , while her creatinine stayed at levels of .6 to .7 . an elevation by dr. freiermthalskush of renal medicine at first suspected a subclinical congestive heart failure as being responsible for a prerenal azotemia , however on further elucidation of the patient 's course , it is evident that a broad sepsis caused by her pneumonia was responsible for her decreased svr and eventual renal hypoperfusion . her azotemia responded readily to pressor support and fluid resuscitation . at the end of her second intensive care unit admission , her bun and creatinine had resolved to normal values . 5. gastrointestinal : ms. abreun was admitted nothing by mouth , intubated on intravenous fluids alone . she was immediately begun on total parenteral nutrition therapy for what would be a prolonged course without po intake . on july 25th a g tube was placed and feeds were begun gradually . these g tube feeds were gradually increased with a total parenteral nutrition wean , however at the time of her re-admission to the intensive care unit on august 29th aspiration was suspected and all tube feeds were held . she was maintained on total parenteral nutrition for the course of her time in the intensive care unit . at the end of this time , she was begun gradually on g tube feeding , however she was able to tolerate only very small volumes and produce large aspirates . this problem had remained and been ongoing for the remainder of her hospital at fairm of ijordcompmac hospital . she is currently being supported on tube feeds of vivonex at a rate of approximately 20 and hour with aspirates being measured q 4 hours and measuring from 30 to 250 regularly . she has also been supplemented with glutamine 10 grams b.i.d. via the g tube in hopes of reviving what most certainly be her gut atrophy from prolonged disuse . ms. abreun , from the onset of her stay at fairm of ijordcompmac hospital demonstrated elevated alkaline phosphatase levels in isolation from her other liver function tests . these values ranging as high as 2300 were evaluated by gastrointestinal consult who came and performed and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which demonstrated a normal biliary system with diameters on the large end of normal . stone was demonstrated in the gallbladder , but there was no evidence of obstruction and the study was ready as normal . 5 'nucleotidase values have also been elevated ranging from 150 to 180 . to date there has been no satisfactory explanation for these elevations in alkaline phosphatase and 5 'nucleotidase and all associated studies have been negative . further evaluation of this during her later hospital stay or as an outpatient . 6. infectious disease : ms. abreun underwent a work up for tuberculosis at the beginning of her hospital course . she ruled out by ppd . the initial management of her necrotizing fascitis was empiric with imipenem , flagyl and vancomycin . because of the extent of her wound , she was also treated with hyperbaric oxygen which was of some benefit in resolving her infection . the course of flagyl , imipenem and vancomycin was continued for fourteen days . at this time imipenem were discontinued and vancomycin was maintained alone for additional several days . she then went without antibiotic therapy for a period of several weeks until her crisis of august 29th . on admission to the unit , she was begun on triple antibiotic therapy with levo / vanc/flagyl . shortly thereafter gentamicin was added to the regimen which was maintained for a period of one week until cultures came back and her therapy could be stream lined to vancomycin , levofloxacin alone . after a ten day course of levofloxacin it was discontinued , vancomycin was maintained for five additional days , after which time , it was discontinued as well and she was without antibiotics . on discharge , she was currently taking no antibiotics . ms. abreun entered the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital having taking only oral hypoglycemic agents for control of her diabetes . because of the stress of her infection and intensive care unit admission she was requiring sliding scale insulin for the full course of her hospital stay . her total parenteral nutrition was also supplemented with insulin nph for better control . her total parenteral nutrition is currently supplemented with 30 units nph q day and she is on a sliding scale to control the remainder of her sugars . ms. abreun 's hypothyroidism diagnosed shortly before her admission was an important aspect of her therapy during her course at fairm of ijordcompmac hospital . her thyroid necessity was poorly controlled with a synthroid dose of 0.125 milligrams for the majority of her stay . at the time of her admission to the intensive care unit on august 29th it was noted that she had a thyroid stimulating hormone that was dramatically raised to a value of 26.83 . more active supplementation was performed increasing her dose to .3 milligrams q day , which caused a rapid resolution of her thyroid studies and an improvement in her physiology almost immediately . she has since been maintained on a dose of 0.2 milligrams iv q d . however , she has had a gradual rise in her thyroid stimulating hormone to a value of 6.68 . her discharge medication will include synthroid dose of 0.3 milligrams po q day with recommendation that this parameter be followed closely . in summary : ms. abreun is a fifty nine-year-old female who presented with necrotizing fascitis of the right hip , status post debridement , severely debilitated by the extent of her infection . over the course of 2 months this infection was cleared , the wound was cleaned and split thickness skin grafting was successful in covering over the wound . her course , however was complicated by an methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was resistant to therapy and which produced a profound sepsis which caused a hypotensive ana apneic episode which required intensive care unit support for a period of a week . her course was also complicated by her hypoactive thyroid function which went unrecognized for some period , but has since resolved with aggressive synthroid therapy . currently , her most issues are the advancement of her tube feeds and the restarting of her po intake which was planned to begin for the next several days before her transfer was initiated . her wound also requires further care as smaller areas of non-take in the graft are being management with sterile saline wet to dry dressings . condition on discharge : stable with issues resolving . medications on discharge : heparin 5,000 units sub q b.i.d. prilosec 20 milligrams per g tube q day . paxil 10 milligrams per g tube q.h.s. milk of magnesia 30 ccs per g tube q.h.s. lotrimin cream b.i.d. to effected areas . nystatin powder b.i.d. to effected areas . lasix 20 milligrams intravenous q day . synthroid 0.3 milligrams per g tube q day . reglan 10 milligrams per g tube t.i.d. peri-colace 15 ccs per g tube q.h.s. glutamine 10 grams diluted as necessary per g tube t.i.d. ativan 0.5 milligrams to 1 milligrams per g tube or sublingual q 6 hours whenever necessary . insulin sliding scale as follows ; 0 to 70 call house officer , 70 to 200 no insulin , 201 to 250 2 units of insulin , 251 to 300 4 units of insulin , 301 to 350 6 units of insulin , 351 to 400 8 units of insulin , 401 or above 10 units of insulin and call house officer . the patient is also receiving total parenteral nutrition as designed by the nutritional services at fairm of ijordcompmac hospital . instructions : dressing changes with sterile saline wet to dry guaze bandages on areas of breakdown on the graft . the patient is currently nothing by mouth and will require a modified barium swallow before beginning po feeds . physical therapy and occupational therapy to work with patient daily in improving activity and working toward ambulation . disposition : follow up with primary care physician dr. vontha elkszuk , phone number ( 644 ) 075-7150 . sta bodejove , m.d. dictating for : rey caffefalmyoretland , m.d. tr : ug dd :

dilated cardiomyopathy , inferior myocardial infarction , and anterior mediastinal masses admitted with acute onset of pulmonary edema . in the setting of inadvertently decreasing lasix from 80 mg. po 40 mg. a day mr. state had sudden onset dyspnea after approximate day and a half prodrome culminating in severe dyspnea . upon arrival in the emergency room mr. state 's saturations were in the mid 80s and he was promptly rendered more comfortable with high flow oxygen , morphine , and nitrates and intravenous lasix . chest x-ray was relatively unrevealing for interstitial or alveolar edema and with clinical improvement ensued with the immediate therapy in the emergency room as noted . the patient denied angina , syncope , preceding worsening orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations , chest pain , hematemesis or melena . past medical history : is notable for an inferior myocardial infarction , restrictive and obstructive lung disease with an fev1 of .9 and fvc of

revealing an lvid of 62 mm. and ejection fraction of 28 percent , moderate mitral regurgitation and mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 33 and a mean gradient of 19 and a valve area of 1.4 cm. squared . in addition , mr. state has an anterior mediastinal mass 2x2x1.7 cm. by recent computerized tomography scan without surrounding or adjacent adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease apart from bronchiectasis . his cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ana , negative spep , upep and benz-jones proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative . the patient lives on quelene with his wife . he is a non-smoker and drinks rare alcohol . physical examination : the patient was a very pleasant man who appeared his stated age . blood pressure was 155/60 , heart rate 70 with occasional premature ventricular contractions , respirations 14 . mr. state was dyspneic speaking in short sentences initially on high flow oxygen . jugular venous pressure was 8 with a brisk inspiratory descent . there was no thyromegaly . carotids were 2+ . breath sounds were decreased at the bases only with distant heart sounds and a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur consistent with aortic stenosis with gallavardin like radiation to the apex . abdomen : soft , nontender with hepatosplenomegaly , or hepatojugular reflex , bruits or pulsations . there was no rash and no edema and the neurological examination was non-focal . laboratory data : notable for a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.6 , bun 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 104 , hematocrit 42 , white count 8.7 , platelet count 235 and a pt of 12.9 seconds . the urinalysis was negative . the troponin i was less than .4 and the creatine kinase was 114 . chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases . the electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations . after a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent . prior to catheterization a vq scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for pe with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung . subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and d-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent . it was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto . coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries . after a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute . based upon these findings it was felt that mr. state most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state . in hospital he was seen by both speech therapy , physical therapy , and the uspend harmemewood medical center congestive heart failure nurse practitioner program . his isordil was increased in hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 . future adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures . at a goal weight of 142 pounds , mr.

subarachnoid hemorrhage , history prostate cancer . history of present illness : the patient presented to ph university of medical center with a fever . the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of parkinson 's disease x 's 18 years , prostate cancer , urinary incontinence and recent subdurals after fall . he reports lower abdominal pain x's 2 days . of note , he is a very poor historian given his difficulty speaking and inability to write from his parkinson 's disease . his wife noted him to be restless on the day of admission , felt warm , temperature to 102.5 . they went to a local hospital where he was found to have a temperature of 102.4 and blood cultures were done and he was transferred to ph university of medical center for admission . he was recently started on a texas catheter for urinary incontinence at home . he has no symptoms of shortness of breath , cough , diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , choking on food , no new medications . past medical history : as above . medications ; on admission were eldepryl , artane , prilodol , sinemet and opuputine . allergies : he had no known drug allergies . hospital course and treatment : the patient was admitted and started on ampingent intravenously . there was a question of aspiration pneumonia so he was switched from ampicillin pen-g to aspiration pneumonia . he was continued on his parkinson 's medications . a head ct was scheduled to rule out interval increase in subdurals . head ct results show full bilateral acute hemorrhage in his subdural hematomas , now with slight midline shift . dr. factor agreed he would review the cts and follow the patient while in house . he was seen by urology , who suggested to leave the catheter in for now in the setting of doubt ms . he was seen by neuro , who felt that the subdural hemorrhages should be followed and treated conservatively as well as precautions for fall and no further intervention was warranted given risk of re-bleed which is quite high with his atrophic changes . the patient 's mental status improved greatly after the onset of intravenous antibiotics , doing much better , was much more awake and alert and the plan was to possibly send him home on po antibiotics and full arnsperni health services . bedside swallow test was done which showed him to have some aspiration . he did have some recurrent fevers and his intravenous antibiotic were continued . thus , he was considered ready for discharge . he again became much more somnolent , there was a question whether he had re-aspirated . he again was becoming increasing febrile and somnolent while the patient was awaiting a chest x-ray and further evaluation . he was switched over the clinda and gentamicin for his aspiration pneumonia and again his mental status improved . on 8/10/97 , the patient became unresponsive and apneic . brachial consult was obtained and the patient was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit . he was found to be profoundly hypoxic with sats down to 60% on 100% facemask . he was hypotensive into the 80s . an electrocardiogram showed evolving inferior q wave with increased st segment and left anterior st depressions . rv leads were negative for st elevation . a chest x-ray showed marked congestive heart failure with increased heart size . a portable echo showed no pericardial effusion and his left ventricle was severely diffusely hypokinetic with septal dyskinesis . anterior and inferior akinesis , apical akinesis to the posterior lateral wall moved slightly . he had about 20% mild mitral regurgitation . the right ventricle was markedly dilated with a kinetic free wall and very decreased function in a marked incomplete closure of the tricuspid valve with wide open tricuspid regurgitation . he was transferred to the intensive care unit for his acute myocardial infarction with very likely multi-vessel disease with concominent left anterior descending severe stenosis or likely left anterior descending with collateral circulation from that occluded right coronary artery . the patient was also evaluated by neurosurgery , given the difficult situation , the patient was not a candidate for streptokinase or tpa given his chronic subdurals with a recent new bleed . he was evaluated by neurosurgery , who felt that if heparin could be avoided , that would be best . he was treated conservatively with intubation , control of heart rate and on dobutamine for pressure support . he was diuresed with lasix and diuril and was oxygenating fairly well while intubated . he surprisingly made it through the next 24 hours . he was dynamically stable on his dobutamine with improved oxygenation . the patient continued fairly stable while intubated . two days after the myocardial infarction he continued with stable blood pressure on a very small amount of dobutamine . he had diuresed very well with good oxygenation . his neurostatus was indeterminate given his sedation on the ventilatory . discussions with the family were ongoing regarding do not resuscitate and long term plan given his comorbidities . they were waiting appropriately for some information from the repeat echo after his myocardial infarction . an echo showed that there was not much improvement in cardiac function , both right or left ventriculus . they did at that time decide to make him do not resuscitate , but were interested in continuing supportive care to see how much he would bounce back . the repeat echo showed no improvement in left ventricle or right ventricle function with marked akinesis of many walls . the lack of meaningful recovery was much less likely . discussions were had with the family regarding withdrawal of ventilator support , which they very appropriately decided on given the low possibility of any meaningful recovery . he was extubated successfully and was breathing comfortably on his own . the patient was transferred back to the medical floor in stable , but very guarded condition . no further blood draws were done . the patient was made comfortable on a low dose of intravenous morphine with sectioning to prevent further aspiration . comfort measures continued until the day 8/19/97 , where mr. koteleebdils was found to be pulseless , without respirations . he was declared dead at 7:15 a.m. on 8/19/97 . the family and the attending

{"id": 74, "label": "current-smoker", "text": "history of present illness : this is a 64 year old patient initially admitted to dr. riode area status post an aorto bifemoral bypass in 01/98 with an end to end proximal and to the common femoral bilaterally . the patient has had recurrent claudication for the last five months and has developed lesions on the first toe which is apparently similar to aparonychia . he had an angiogram which shows a severe stenosis in the right distal area with a thrombosing right limb of an aorto femoral graft . he also has an irregular lesion at the profunda femoris origin and with the superficial femoral occluded bilaterally . he was therefore admitted to the hospital for an ileofemoral bypass . the patient unfortunately continues to smoke and has greater than a 50 pack year history of smoking and by notes of dr. area 's office , this has been discussed at length with him and the implications of the smoking . he has a history of a deep vein thrombosis and a question of a pulmonary embolism with what is thought to be a non fully documented hypercoagulable state . he had a left superficial femoral artery interposition graft around 1990 which is non functioning at the present time , most of which was done at the alconspore woocawo medical center . allergies : the patient has no known drug allergies . medications on admission : his medications on admission include coumadin and levofloxacin . his coumadin has been held for two days . his claudication is equal bilaterally . physical examination : on physical examination was remarkable for no carotid bruits , a ventral hernia without any masses which was reasonably reducible . his rectal exam was refused at the time of surgery since apparently it was negative at the tocon hospital the previous week . he has a first and fourth toe which had some purulent discharge around the toes with ischemic modeled toes and on the left side there were no lesions in the feet . his pulse exam was a femoral pulse bilaterally , but none distally . laboratory data : his bun and creatinine were within normal limits at 16 and 1.3 and his hematocrit was 44 with a white blood count of 10,000 and 139,000 platelet count . he has ankle brachial indices of .36 bilaterally but with his right toes appearing ischemic with lesions he would most likely not heal these lesions . hospital course : dr. area had asked me to see the patient and after discussing with the patient it was agreed that i would proceed with revascularization of his right leg since he had a angiogram which demonstrated a failing limb of his aortofemoral graft and a tight profundus stenosis . after discussing with the patient , getting his prothrombin time closer to range , he was brought to the operating room where a ileo profunda bypass was performed with an 8 mm . ep to fe under general endotracheal anesthesia . there was copious thrombus in the distal right limb of the aortofemoral graft which also had a thromboendarterectomy performed and excellent inflow was achieved . superficial femoral artery was divided since it was also chronically occluded . there was a significant amount of thrombus at the anastomosis as well which had developed a small aneurysmaltype of dilatation , although there was no dehiscence of the anastomosis . the profunda had been opened beyond the origin stenosis and the bypass was then performed providing and excellent flow to the calf and excellent pulsevolume recordings were obtained with strong upstrokes . it was therefore elected not to proceed with a distal bypass graft to the popliteal arteries which would have been required should this not have worked . the patient postoperatively did quite well . he had continued good post volume recordings and there was no question that with this improved circulation and silvadene dressings to his toes that they actually started to heal in his postoperative course with improved perfusion and capillary refill . his groin incision was healing nicely and he was on heparin , being converted to coumadin . because of the issue relating to his hypercoagulable state , and the need for getting him in range , he was keptin the hospital and not discharged . the orders of his wounds and wound care were clarified and he was transferred to frontera 34 to ensure that this would be performed properly . no cellulitis was present , and the patient had indicated his desire to be discharged . despite loading him on coumadin , his prothrombin time and inr increased slowly and he left the hospital without discharge order or discharge planning on the 18th of december . i had called the patient and discussed with him his care , which he had been then transferring to his local medical doctor for anticoagulation purposes . i explained to the patient that because of his early discharge i would not be able to be responsible for his care but would be happy to see him in theoffice for removal of his sutures and an appointment for that was undertaken . degreg r. uph , m.d. electronically signed a lisswhiti area , m.d. 01/30/2001 04:33 _ tr : yg dd : 01/18/2001 td : 01/22/2001 9:24 pcc : riode

, negative for alcohol . the patient lives alone , but in a senior living facility adjacent to friends . hospital course : 1 ) cardiovascular : the patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction . she remained on telemetry for greater than 48 hours which demonstrated no dysrhythmia during this time . the patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction with left ventricular hypertrophy and no significant valvular abnormalities . the patient was maintained on her aspirin and lasix . the patient 's diltiazem was stopped due to her increased blood pressure and was started on labetalol which was gradually titrated up to a target blood pressure of 160-170 systolic in her right arm . the patient also underwent an adenosine mibi stress test which showed only mild lateral ischemia . at this time , the patient 's presyncopal symptoms were not felt to be secondary to a cardiovascular etiology . 2 ) neurological / vascular : the discrepancy in the patient 's pulses and blood pressure was felt to be consistent with a subclavian artery stenosis . the patient underwent mri / mra of the head , neck and upper chest which demonstrated a proximal left subclavian artery stenosis , proximal to the take off of the left vertebral artery . the left vertebral artery had a decreased flow consistent with either native vessel disease or some degree of retrograde flow with subclavian steal phenomenon . the patient had patent carotids bilaterally on her neck mra . mri of the head demonstrated a small vessel disease and was likely an old right cerebellar infarct . the patient underwent non-invasive carotid ultrasounds which demonstrated no significant carotid disease . the patient was also noted to have antegrade flow in both of her vertebral arteries bilaterally . the results of these studies suggested that the patient 's symptoms were not due to subclavian steal phenomenon , and therefore , it was decided that the patient would not go further to angio and / or surgical or percutaneous intervention . a neurology consult was obtained and it was felt that the most valuable intervention that could be done for the patient 's intervascular disease would be adequate control of her blood pressure . 3 ) orthopedic : the patient suffered a fall at home with her initial event . outside hip films were obtained , but were not available for view . repeat hip films demonstrated a right sided pubic rami fracture , likely new . an orthopedics consult was obtained and the patient was encouraged to weight bear as tolerated with physical therapy assistance . a bone scan was also obtained to rule out an occult hip fracture which was negative . at the time of this dictation , the patient was able to bear weight with the assistance of physical therapy and a walker . plans were made for the patient to be discharged to dwardmegriff rehabilitation for rehabilitation of her rami fracture . 4 ) gastrointestinal : the patient had an episode of her described vertigo while lying in bed and on the monitor during which no dysrhythmia was noted . the patient also complained of frequent vomiting at least once a day , occasionally associated with ingestion of her medications , but sometimes associated with ambulation . the patient has a long-standing history of spontaneous emesis due to overwhelming stress or excitement . however , the patient reports emesis in the hospital more frequently . the patient 's emesis was noted to be bilious without evidence of new or old blood . the etiology of the patient 's nausea remained unclear as she demonstrated ability to keep down many of her meals which did not suggest an anatomical lesion of her gastrointestinal tract . the patient was started on meclizine on december 31 , 2000 for her nausea and vertigo . an attempt was also made to reduce the patient 's large number of medications and the patient 's os-cal , multivitamin , lasix and colace were discontinued . 5 ) infectious disease : the patient complained of some urinary incontinence and difficulty initiating urine on december 30 , 2000 . urinalysis demonstrated a likely urinary tract
