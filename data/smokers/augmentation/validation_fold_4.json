then , dr. thorebreutz took him to the operating room , where he had quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting . he had a left internal mammary artery graft of the lad , a single saphenous vein to the right coronary artery with 280 cc per minute flow , and a saphenous vein snake graft to the diagonal and circumflex with 150 cc per minute flow . a paraphimosis was noted and treated by dr. ryna jescdrig . after surgery he had a ongoing sinus tachycardia . he was able to be rapidly weaned and extubated . he had good hemodynamics . he had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats . his intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the surgical intensive care unit . he was seen in consultation by the nutrition service , who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus . on 08/05 it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous heparin and indeed , when heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal . therefore , he does have a thrombocytopenic reaction to heparin . he remained in normal sinus rhythm . he did have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , which were clinically stable . he had a right bundle branch block . he is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction , but he is clinically stable on ace inhibitors , digoxin , coumadin , and aspirin . therefore he was able to be discharged home . he understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin times and his arrhythmias ;

hematuria status post nephrostomy tube placement transferred to retelk county medical center for further management . history of present illness : mr. prehekote is an 88-year-old portuguese speaking only male who was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate in 1998 . he received transurethral resection of the prostate one year ago because of persistent urinary retention . after that , he was on lupron and nilandron hormone therapy . the patient was admitted on february 23 , 1999 to eifro medical center because of failure to thrive and decreased hematocrit . he was noted to have elevated bun and creatinine . bun was 34 and creatinine was 2.6 , up from his baseline of 1.0 . prostate specific antigen increased from 77.9 to 88 , and the patient also had urinary incontinence and body weight loss . further evaluation of his renal failure showed that the patient has bilateral hydronephrosis , most likely obstructive uropathy due to prostate ca in the pelvic area . because of the increasing creatinine to 8.0 on february 28 , 1999 , a left nephrostomy tube was placed . however after the procedure , the patient 's hematocrit dropped to 24 and he was transfused two units of packed red blood cells . his hematocrit increased to about 30 , but he continued to have hematuria and his renal function only improved very slowly . he also received kayexalate for hyperkalemia . due to the persistent blood in the urine , he was transferred from eifro medical center to the retelk county medical center for angiographic studies to rule out any vascular injuries . the patient was

looking elderly male lying in bed in no acute distress . temperature 95.4 , pulse 120 , blood pressure 150/80 , respiratory rate 24 , 95% on room air . conjunctiva were not pale . sclera nonicteric . pupils : isocoric cataract bilaterally . mouth : mucous membranes slightly dry . no oral ulcers . neck : supple . jugular vein not engorged . carotid pulses bounding very strongly . no thyromegaly . chest examination showed some basilar crackles at the right lung base . heart initially tachycardia , grade ii / vi systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border . abdomen : soft . liver and spleen were not palpable . bowel sounds normoactive . extremities : traced pitting edema . no cyanosis and no clubbing . peripheral pulses were very strong and bounding . no calf tenderness . homan 's

chloride 107 , bicarb 14 , bun 63 , creatinine 5.8 , blood sugar 133 . liver function test showed ast 21 , alkaline phosphatase 70 , total bilirubin 0.3 , total protein 6.5 , albumin 3.9 , globulin 2.6 . cbc : wbc 8.4 , hematocrit 32.6 , platelet count 194,000 . pt 11.9 , inr 1.0 , ptt 28.4 . chest x-ray showed no evidence of cardiomegaly . no lung infiltrate . ct scan of the renal area showed right hydronephrosis which extends to an asymmetrically thickened urinary bladder wall . a mass like thickening of the urinary bladder suggestive of either detrusor hypertrophy or possibly tumor . the ct scan showed a cavitary lung lesion in the right lower lobe compatible with metastatic or septic embolus . ekg showed atrial fibrillation , left axis deviation , lvh , nonspecific st-t changes either due to digitalis affect . ck enzymes 146 . repeated three times and remained flat . troponin i on the second day of admission was 1.18 . hospital course : after admission , urology , nephrology as well as interventional radiology was consulted about the management of this patient . the specialist concluded that because the patient 's hematuria seemed to be stable and hematocrit to maintain at about 29-30 , there is no urgent need to do an arteriogram which may cause further damage to the patient 's kidney . urology consultation thinks that cystoscopy would not add any benefit to the management and only would consider a right nephrostomy if renal function failed to improve . after admission , the patient was treated conservatively to correct his electrolyte and metabolic acidosis . he was given blood transfusion , two units when his hematocrit dropped to 29.4 . after transfusion , the patient 's hematocrit rose to 37.7 on the day of discharge . the patient was also given sodium bicarbonate to correct his metabolic acidosis . he continued to pass about 1500-2000 cc of urine a day and his renal function improved slowly with creatinine decreased to 4.2 on the day of discharge . during this admission , the patient also developed atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of about 70-80 . cpk was tracked , but was totally normal . no beta blockers were given . a long discussion amongst the specialist , nephrology , urology , interventional radiology , primary oncology as well with the family lead to the conclusion that conservative management may give the patient more comfort than crisis treatment in this well advanced prostate ca . dr. lucreamull discussed the patient 's clinical status and overall situation with the patient 's family and the family decided that mr. prehekote could return home with hospice . the patient 's primary care physician , dr. tomedankell flowayles will manage the hospice issues . the patient was discharged to home for

{"id": 9, "label": "unknown", "text": "principal diagnosis : metastatic melanoma . principal procedure : wide resection of metastatic melanoma to the right shoulder with partial thickness skin graft reconstruction on 9/1/00 . history of present illness : this is a 69 year old man who was initially diagnosed with a right upper posterior extremity melanoma level 4 , 2.5 mm in depth , in 10/02/92 . subsequently in 10/92 he underwent a wide excision with axillary dissection which showed residual malignant melanoma with nine negative lymph nodes . he had a recurrence in 05/99 in a similar area which was 2.1 mm in thickness . he had this resected between 8/4 and 9/5/97 and was treated with 6000 c of radiation therapy over the right upper extremity . he has done well since that time and subsequently in 05/98 had pulmonary nodules which were noted and a computer tomogram scan in 08/98 demonstrated a 4.2 cm splenic lesion . he underwent an open splenectomy in the fall 1998 which demonstrated metastatic melanoma only to the spleen . since that time he has been treated with _______ cells in 1999 and also with allovecting injection to the right anterior axillary nodule . most recently in he has this right anterior axillary metastatic melanoma resected at brook hospital by dr. bainpruess on with local triceps myocutaneous tissue transfer . since april through july this area has increased in size where the triceps tissue transfer has been replaced with a bulky metastatic melanoma disease . surgical consultation for resection of this for local ___ control was requested . the patient has ___ dr. peakekudz and has known visceral metastases of the liver as well the lung with mediastinal adenopathy which has been stable for the past two years . the other complicating factor in his care was that he was wheelchair bound from a viral meningeal encephalomyelitis in 1966 and has relied heavily on his upper extremity for wheelchair transfer and access and transportation . in order to workup up this metastatic melanoma recurrent after local excision only two months previously it was elected to get an magnetic resonance imaging scan of the shoulder . this magnetic resonance imaging scan confirmed that there was a large mass which measured approximately 4-6cm anterior to the deltopectoral groove and unfortunately a smaller lesion 1cm was seen separately adjacent and medial to the biceps tendon near the brachial neurovascular bundle . an magnetic resonance imaging scan which was performed three months prior to admission to brook hospital for resection demonstrated that this more medial lesion was not present at that time and therefore it was suspicious for metastatic melanoma . the patient had a fine needle aspiration of this bulky tumor mass which demonstrated malignant melanoma and subsequently he was sent for a positron emission tomography scan which was performed at s nakantlakeing university hospital and medical center on 8/24/00 . the positron emission tomography scan demonstrated a known larger anterior metastatic melanoma and more medially two approximately 1cm lesions that also enhanced . these were consistent with metastatic melanoma near the brachial plexus confirmed by the magnetic resonance imaging scan . the patient now presents for surgical resection and reconstructive repair of this lesion . past medical history : viral meningeal encephalomyelitis in 1996 which left him paralyzed from waist down and wheelchair bound . he is incontinent of bowel and bladder and wears a texas catheter due to phimosis of the penis . he also suffered comminuted fractures of the right lower extremity . he has bilateral venous stasis and hypertension . past surgical history : as above including a splenectomy . medications on admission : 1. atenolol 25 mg po per day . allergies : bactrim . sulfa . intravenous pyelogram dye . social history : he works as a lawyer . he is active in general practice and is divorced with four daughter one of which is a neurologist who comes to visit him often . her name is dr. lynea moyduhe . family history : father with renal cell carcinoma and prostate cancer . mother with primary brain tumor . physical examination : afebrile , vital signs stable . his right shoulder had a large 6cm bulky mass which had grown somewhat in size over the past 2-3 weeks . the bulky mass is somewhat mobile on the medial aspect and there are subcutaneous nodules which had not been present before . the axillary area medially has two dominant nodules . hospital course : the patient underwent a wide excision of the malignant melanoma of his right shoulder and partial thickness skin grafting to his right axilla . the donor site was his right thigh . he tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications . a vac dressing was applied postoperatively and this was maintained for four days . when this was taken down the graft was noted to be healthy with good take . it was then dressed with adaptic and bacitracin ointment and covered with a dry sterile dressing per day . the harvest site was blown dry with a blow dryer . the patients pain was controlled initially with a pca and this was eventually discontinued and he was started on oxycontin . his foley was discontinued and a texas catheter was reapplied . he was tolerating a regular diet with regular bowel movements with digital rectal stimulation . he began to work with ot service . they began range of motion to his right upper extremity except for around his shoulder . this was kept to minimal activity . he remained afebrile with stable vital signs . on discharge his graft is clean , dry and intact without any evidence of discharge or erythema . his donor site is also without evidence of infection . condition on discharge : good . discharge instructions : regarding the patient 's physical activity status he is to be minimally weight baring of the right upper extremity . there is to be no range of motion to the right shoulder but active range of motion to the rest of his right upper extremity . he is not to transfer to a wheelchair using his upper arm . diet is regular . for dressings , an adaptic with bacitracin should be applied to the shoulder graft per day . this should be covered with a dry sterile dressing . medications on discharge : 1. tylenol 650 mg po q4h as needed . 2. atenolol 25 mg po per day . 3. benadryl 25-50 mg intravenous qhs as needed . 4. valium 5-10 mg po four times per day as needed . 5. oxycontin 10 mg po three times a day . 6. oxycodone 5-10 mg po q4h as needed pain . 7.

continued to have nausea and vomiting . the patient was seen in consultation by dr. signs of gastroenterology . eventually , a picc line was inserted and he was given central total parenteral nutrition because of severe anorexia during radiation therapy . two weeks passed without a bowel movement because of the lack of intake and eventually that resolved . it was felt that endoscopy would be of value . a central venous line was placed on 8-29-93 . after neutropenia resolved by 9-2-93 with white blood count rising to 2.2 and platelet count to 28,000 , endoscopy became feasible . this was done on 9-4-93 and there were inflammatory exudates , ulcerations , and granulation tissue in the middle and distal third of the esophagus , but the tumor polypoid masses had completely disappeared . cytologic brushings of the ulcerated areas were positive for cancer cells but deep biopsies were negative . the patient was treated with fluconazole in case there was any monilia , although biopsy did not confirm the presence of monilia . gradually during the hospitalization , the sternal pain improved , as did the pain in the left hip and the patient became able to ambulate somewhat . he was making progress and accordingly , a second course of chemotherapy was given at lower dose . he received vp-16 100 mg daily x three , 9-12 , 9-13 and 9-14-93 , and cisplatin 40 mg daily x three on that same date with zofran 10 mg. the only problem was some recurrent nausea . the radiation therapy was finally finished on the day of discharge , 9-19-93 , at which point the patient was able to take fluids and food but was still occasionally vomiting . his white blood count was in the range of 53,000 because neupogen had been started with his second cycle of chemotherapy and will be continued until it is clear that he has passed the nadir of any neutropenia to be expected from this cycle of chemotherapy . discharge diagnosis : 1. metastatic small cell cancer of esophageal origin to liver and bone , 2. severe ulcerations of the esophagus at sites of prior tumor , 3. intractable nausea and vomiting , 4. pain syndrome , largely resolved , 5. hypertension .

echocardiogram 3/27/93 . doctors discharge orders : lasix 40 mg qd ; digoxin 0.25 mg qd ; aspirin 325 mg qd ; isordil 10 mg tid . history of present illness : mr. breun underwent a six vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure in march , 1990 , following a complicated inferior posterior myocardial infarction . he had a very stormy course , dominated by post infarction angina pectoris , high grade atrial ventricular block , gastrointestinal bleeding , pneumonia , and no noliguric renal failure . an intra-aortic balloon pump was required for stabilization . he also had moderately severe aortic stenosis at that time with a peak aortic valve gradient of 30 , and a calculated valve area of 1.2 cm squared . despite the magnitude of these problems , he made a remarkable recovery over the course of several months , and was able to return to work on a part-time basis , after joining a program of cardiac rehabilitation . postoperatively , we measured a left ventricle ejection fraction of 40% , by gated cardiac blood pool scanning . over these past 3 years , he has remained stable , on a very simple program of aspirin , and atenolol . he returned for routine office evaluation on 3/25/93 , complaining of 2 months of progressive exertional dyspnea , with occasional chest discomfort , and , more recently , orthopnea , cough , peripheral edema , and weight gain . physical examination : weight 197 lbs , up 6 lbs , blood pressure 128/88 , heart rate 70 and regular . the venous pressure was markedly elevated to 15 cm . the carotids were of low volume , and sluggish bilaterally , with transmission of a basal heart murmur . there was dullness at both bases , with rales 1/3 way upon the right , and at the base on the left . the right ventricle , and left ventricle impulses were diffuse . there was a grade i-ii murmur of aortic stenosis , with additional murmurs of tricuspid , and mitral regurgitation , and an obvious s3 . the liver was enlarged 2 finger breadths below the right costal margin , and there was 1-2+ peripheral edema . his chest x-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly , with bilateral pleural effusions , right greater than left , and pulmonary vascular re-distribution . the electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with first degree av block , an old inferior myocardial infarction , and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction , and non-specific st-t wave abnormalities , that were unchanged compared to june , 1992 . later , an echocardiogram on 3/27/93 , demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with calcification of the annulus , and incomplete closure of the valve , consistent with papillary muscle dysfunction . the left atrium was dilated to 52 mm . the aortic valve was thickened , with restrictive motion , and there were indistinct mobile echo densities on the leaflets . there was evidence of trace aortic regurgitation , however , due to technical difficulties , accurate gradients could not be estimated . the left ventricle was dilated , with concentric hypertrophy , and multi segmental wall motion abnormalities , with a reduced ejection fraction of 24% . there was also doppler evidence of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary insufficiency . a persantine thallium scan on 3/31/93 , showed increased lung uptake , cavity dilatation and a large inferior , apical scar , without evidence of active ischemia . laboratory data : potassium 4.4 , bun and creatinine 33/1.7 , albumen 3.6 , total bilirubin 1.8 , direct bilirubin 0.5 , ck 162 , with 11.1 mb for a relative index of 6.9% . this was of uncertain significance . the hematocrit 43.2 , whiteblood count 9.2 , prothrombin time 10.4 , partial thromboplastin time 34.2 , urinalysis had 1+ albumen and 0-2 white blood cells , per high power field , with a culture that demonstrated rare enterococcus . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the medical service , and placed at bed rest , and given intravenous furosemide . over the course of the next few days , we succeeded in having his weight decrease from its value of 189 lbs , to as low as 177 1/2 lbs . coincident with this , his clinical condition improved markedly , and he became fully ambulatory . given the difficulties in trying to assess the exact mechanism by which his heart failure had occurred , we proceeded to cardiac catheterization on 4/1/93 . at the time of this study , the right atrial pressure was 1 , the pa pressure 32/10 , and the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 10 . there was a 40-50 mm peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve , a mean gradient of 40 , and a calculated valve area of 0.5 cm squared , using a cardiac output of 3.4 liters per minute . left ventriculography demonstrated marked left ventricle dilatation . there was mild mitral regurgitation , a posterior basil aneurysm , and akinesis of the apex , septum , and inferior walls . the anterior lateral wall was severely hypokinetic , and the posterior lateral wall moderately kinetic . the aortic valve was calcified with reduced excursion consistent with his aortic stenosis . a dominant right coronary artery had an 80% proximal stenosis , and was then occluded at the acute margin . a large right ventricular marginal branch did fill the saphenous vein graft in a retrograde fashion . the posterior descending artery had an 80% stenosis proximal to the insertion of the graft . the left anterior descending was proximally occluded , and the left circumflex had a 90% stenosis in the first marginal branch , and 90% stenosis distally in other branches . the saphenous vein graft to the right ventricular acute marginal and posterior descending artery was patent with good runoff . the saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending had a minor plaque at the distal anastomosis . the saphenous vein graft to three distal marginal branches was patent with good flow . certainly , the cardiac catheterization was consistent with severe aortic stenosis in the presence of profound left ventricular systolic dysfunction . these findings were reviewed with dr. patella and together we decided that conservative therapy would be the appropriate first choice in mr. breun 's management . his advanced age , prior cardiac surgery and advanced left ventricular dysfunction , together with his chronic renal insufficiency , would certainly complicate to an enormous degree any undertaking as risky as redo surgery for aortic valve replacement . percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty , on the other hand , would only be a temporary procedure and did not seem necessary even for transient symptomatic relief given his marked improvement following a rather conventional course of intravenous diuretics . it is very unlikely that we will offer mr. breun aortic valve replacement surgery in the future . he seems to agree with this particular approach as the quality of life has become very important and appropriate issue for him . he is looking forward to returning home and going back to work on a part time basis at the local pharmacy . we will see how far we can get with medical therapy although mr. wierst and his family clearly understand

white female without a significant past medical history who presented in the middso memorial hospital emergency room following a nine day history of dizziness on standing without loss of consciousness . during the week prior to admission , the patient complained of severe constipation , dry mouth , possible urinary retention along with some nausea and vomiting . she felt that she was profoundly cold at the time . in the emergency room , the patient was hypotensive with an initial blood pressure of 92/70 and a pulse of 96 lying flat that became 70/50 with a pulse of 104 when standing . the patient was aggressively hydrated with a total of 9 liters of normal saline over a 7 hour period with marginal increase in blood pressure . over the same period of time , the patient became increasingly hypoxic and developed worsening hypertension . stat chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema . the patient was subsequently transferred to the micu on dopamine for further management . past medical history : only noticeable for remote appendectomy and being gravida v , para v . medications on admission : none . allergies : no known drug allergies . social history : the patient has an 80-pack-year history of tobacco and is currently smoking 1-2 packs per day . she also has a questionable alcohol history of up to one quart daily . she is married and lives with her husband . family

reactive to light . extraocular muscles intact . oropharynx benign . eyebrows were notable for lateral thinning . neck was supple without lymphadenopathy . carotids were 2+ . no palpable thyroid . lungs showed decreased breath sounds bilaterally . cardiac exam revealed s1 , s2 with an intermittent s4 without murmur or rubs . abdominal exam was benign . extremities showed mild clubbing , no cyanosis and no edema . neurologic exam : the patient was alert , agitated and oriented to name , date and place moving all extremities . light touch was intact . admission labs : sodium 127 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 76 , bicarb 35 , bun 13 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 105 , serum osmolality 254 , hematocrit 43.5 , white count 10.0 with 68% polys , 20% lymphs and 10 monos . platelets 310 . pt and ptt were normal . lft 's were within normal limits . admission cortisol , aldosterone , b12 and folate and tsh were drawn . chest x-ray on transfer to the micu showed pulmonary vascular redistribution without infiltrate , effusions or nodules as compared with an admission chest x-ray which was interpreted as clear . hospital course : in the micu , the patient initially required dopamine for five days , at which point , she tolerated a wean without recurrent light headedness , dizziness or syncope . echocardiogram revealed preserved ejection fraction without regional wall motion abnormalities . the patient had a swan-ganz catheter placed which showed a cardiac output of 8 with systemic vascular resistance of 700 . because the swan-ganz readings were felt to be explained by sepsis , the patient was treated empirically with cefotaxime , gentamicin and flagyl . all cultures were subsequently negative with the exception of an e coli uti . the infectious workup included a lumbar puncture which was negative for pleocytosis but showed an elevated glucose of 106 and an elevated protein of 76 . the patient had an extensive workup for hypopituitarism . because addisonian crisis could not be initially ruled out , the patient was placed on distressed dose cortisone . however , a random cortisol level drawn initially in the emergency room subsequently returned as normal . the patient also responded appropriately to cortrosyn stimulation test . also , tsh was normal on admission . thyroid function panel drawn while the patient was on dopamine was subsequently abnormal . however , repeat panel was drawn when the patient was stable and had been transferred to the floor and was pending at the time of discharge . the patient was also evaluated by the neurology service for possible dysautonomia as the cause of her orthostatic hypotension with an inappropriate heart rate response to hypotension . emg showed no evidence of peripheral neuropathy . additional studies also included a head ct that showed a small lacunar infarct in the right pons and a partial empty sella which was confirmed by head mri . other studies sent during the workup included a negative serum and urine protein electrophoresis , negative serum and urine immunoglobulin electrophoresis . lh and ssh levels were consistent with a post-menopausal state . galactin levels were within normal limits . ana was negative . ace level was negative . heavy metal screen was negative except for a slightly elevated cobalt level so a possibility of a perineoplastic syndrome was considered . an anti-yo ri and who antibodies were sent and were pending at the time of discharge . on hospital day eight , the patient had uneventfully weaned off dopamine and was transferred to the floor . at that time , the stress dose hydrocortisone was weaned and the patient was switched to prednisone without any evidence of recurrent hypotension . her initial hyponatremia and hypokalemia resolved with stable sodium and potassium levels prior to discharge . in the studying of aggressive fluid resuscitation , it was felt that the patient had been sent into pulmonary edema . the patient auto-diuresed spontaneously . subsequent to the diuresis , reticulonodular diffuse pattern became apparent on chest x-ray . because of the patient 's significant smoking history , chest pt was performed to evaluate the possibility of lymphangitic carcinomatosis . however , the chest ct showed relative sparing of the lower lobes with primary involvement in both upper lobes . the patient following diuresis had no oxygen requirement whatsoever and had no respiratory complaints . prior to discharge , she was evaluated by the pulmonary service who felt that the differential diagnosis for her chest ct included eosinophilic granuloma , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , less likely sarcoidosis . because the patient had no respiratory symptoms , it was felt that her abnormal chest ct would be best evaluated as an out-patient . a new baseline chest x-ray was obtained prior to discharge . she will also require baseline pulmonary function tests as an out-patient . medications on discharge : prednisone taper 40 mg p.o. q day times two days , 30 mg p.o. q day times two days , 20 mg p.o. q day times three days , 10 mg p.o. q day times three days , 5 mg p.o. q day times three days .

area . hospital course : the patient was admitted to a telemetry bed and started on heparin . around 4:00 am the next day , an acute decompensation in respiratory status was noted . lung examination at that point showed good air entry , no wheezing , coarse breath sounds throughout . neurologically , the patient was not following commands . eyes were closed . he was moving the right arm and leg spontaneously , though less than before . withdrawal to pain was still present . both plantars were upgoing . a blood gas at this point showed a ph of 7.49 , po2 61 , pco2 of 33 on 100% non-rebreather mask . ekg showed sinus tachycardia . the patient 's temperature was 102 degrees . a repeat cat scan of the head was performed . this showed continued evolution of the right posterior cerebral artery infarction now extending into the right cerebellar hemisphere . there was also a high density adjacent to the right cerebellar infarction suggesting the presence of hemorrhage . at this point , the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit . an mri and mra of the head was arranged to evaluate the extent of his stroke and the posterior circulation . the mri showed infarct of the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally , the right occipital lobe , the right thalamus and bilateral pons . the mra of the intracranial circulation demonstrated gross patency of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally and the basilar arteries . the left vertebral artery was not visualized . there was a dominant right vertebral artery . there was mildly reduced flow in the branches of the right middle cerebral artery compared to the left . there was visualization of flow within both posterior cerebral arteries . clinically , the patient continued to deteriorate . neurosurgery was consulted , however the neurosurgeons felt that there was no surgical option , since even in the case of cerebellar swelling , there would be no improvement from decompensation . the patient was therefore treated conservatively with fluid restriction and blood pressure management . heparin was discontinued because of the risk of intercerebral hemorrhage . the aspiration pneumonia was treated with cefotaxime and metronidazole . the patient 's family was involved and they decided to opt for dnr / dni in view of the poor prognosis . the patient passed away at 6:45 am on june 12 , 1998 . condition on

10/18/96 . ther procedures : arterial catheterization on 10/14/96 , head ct scan on 10/14/96 history and reason for hospitalization : granrivern call is a 79-year-old right handed white male with a history of questionable progressive supranuclear palsy , atrial fibrillation , deep venous thrombosis , and pulmonary embolus who presents with a change in mental status and a fall at home . his family stated that he had a progressive mental decline over the past three years and was initially diagnosed with parkinson 's disease or features consistent with parkinsonism . this was poorly responsive to eldopa . he was later seen by dr. flo cuchkote at the ph university of medical center and diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy . over the five to six weeks prior to admission he had a drop off in his mental functioning with more frequent episodes of confusion and disorientation and requiring more assistance with his activities of daily living . he also developed a urinary incontinence . he had had two falls to his wife 's recollection , both times slipping off the edge of a chair backwards . on the morning of admission at 8 o'clock , he was noted to be moving his mouth less and speaking \" gibberish \" . he was later sitting in a chair making multiple attempts to get up , which he subsequently did and promptly fell directly on his face at approximately 11:30 a.m. there was no definite clonic activity . there was no known incontinence . he was taken to an outside hospital and nasally intubated and then transferred to the ph university of medical center emergency room where he was orally intubated . a trauma evaluation was negative and thus he was transferred to the neurology service . medications on admission : coumadin 4 mgs po qhs , vasotec 5 mgs

pulmonary embolus ; the wife states since he was in the infantry in world war ii . 3) question progressive supranuclear palsy . 4) old right frontal infarct . 5) hypertension . social history : he lives with his wife who is his primary care giver . he is a former professor at montana . tobacco ; he has some distant history of some very minimal use . alcohol ; he has no recent use . he was a previous drinker of one \" old fashioned \" every night . family history : he has a father who had dementia . there was no history of strokes or bleeding disorders in the family . physical examination : vital signs in the emergency room were 210/100 for blood pressure , heart rate 70 and irregular . he was afebrile . in general he was an intubated elderly frail appearing white male with blood about his face . head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination ; abrasions about his forehead , there was some minimal swelling associated . his neck was rigid ; 1+ carotids without bruits . oropharynx was intubated with blood as well . lungs ; clear to auscultation bilaterally . cardiovascular examination ; regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops . abdominal examination ; soft , non-tender , non-distended , normal active bowel sounds . extremities : no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema . neurologically ; he opens his eyes to voice . he does not regard the examiner . he had no blink to threat . his pupils were three down to two on the right and five down to four on the left . according to the family this iansicoria was old . he had intact corneals bilaterally and intact horizontal dull movements bilaterally . he had left greater than right nasal stimulation to grimace . he had no gag to tube manipulation . motor examination he had a weak withdrawal to nail bed pressure in both hands . he triple flexed his bilateral lower extremities to pain . his deep tendon reflexes were 2+ at the right brachial radialis and right patella ; everywhere else his reflexes were 1 . his toes were down going . summary of laboratory and radiological examinations : sodium 141 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 107 , bicarbonates 23.8 , bun 23 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 165 , po2 377 , pco2 32 , ph 7.50 , asomus 298 , toxic screen negative , white blood cell count 11.1 , hematocrit 39.6 , platelet count 137 , prothrombin time 25.2 , inr 4.3 , partial thromboplastin time 34.7 , urinalysis 1+ albumin, 0-5 high link caths , cervical spine negative , pelvis negative , lumbar spine ; negative , thoracic spine negative . chest x-ray clear . electrocardiogram showed 2 mm of st depressions in v4-6 . head ct scan showed a 2 x 2 x 2 left anterior temporal hemorrhage with minimal surrounding edema . there was also evidence of an old right frontal infarction . hospital course and treatment : 1) neurology : the patient was admitted to the neurology intensive care unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition . he had an electroencephalogram performed on his initial admittance to the intensive care unit which did not show any evidence of seizure activity . it did , however , show diffuse slowing . he was given 1.5 grams of dilantin in the emergency room as well as 2 mgs of intravenous ativan which did little to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination . his hypertension ; his high blood pressure was controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine in the early going and then he was switched to an oral regimen for better control after he was removed from the intensive care unit . he continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his ability to move . he did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right , but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission . his diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was placed under question on further examination of his eye movement since he was able to have excellent superior gaze especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy . it was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process , but this was not clarified during this admission . it was not felt likely to be due to parkinson 's disease , as he had no significant response to eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of tremor , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic . he had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on october 18 , 1996 . this showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct , but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy . in addition , he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage , so tumor was felt to be unlikely . however , this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage . the etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out . 2) cardiovascular : his electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia . he was on intravenous tng and was supratherapeutic on his anti-coagulation . he did have a slight elevation of his tpk with an additional value of 198 with a mb fraction of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2.9 . that was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent ckmbs and was felt that he had a very small \" leaflet \" . he remained chest pain free throughout his admission . 3) pulmonary : after his initial intubation he remained quite stable . he was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex . however , he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission . 4) hematology : he had his prothrombin time reversed with vitamin k 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room . his anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation , but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed . it was decided that his goal inr was to be 2.0 . he did drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period , but his discharge inr was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time . it was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems . 5) gastrointestinal : he was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the ph university of medical center and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision . thus , his nasogastric tube was discontinued on october 19 , 1996 and he tolerated feeding quite well . in discussions with the family , given his age and number of medical problems , it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have a terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions . however , he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be a short term procedure . the family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good , but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary , short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest . disposition / plan on discharge : stable . doctor 's discharge orders : the patient was to be discharged to a rehabilitation hospital , the location of which was undetermined at this time of this discharge summary . the patient is to follow up with dr. ria in clinic on one month time and the family is to

were called . upon arrival , they found the patient in bed , with notes nearby , listing his funeral home preferences and information on his next of kin . the patient indicates that his neighbors were making excessive noise upstairs from his dwelling , and he found it unbearable . he therefore decided to take his life with a gun which he had found in the house . apparently , the gun belonged to his father . on further questioning , the patient described that his father passed away approximately forty to fifty years prior to his admission , and the gun was found in a box in their home . the patient expressed concern that he had several utility bills that he was unable to pay . the patient 's sister died eight years prior to the patient 's admission of leukemia , and he otherwise has no next of kin with the exception of one brother in washington , with whom his relationship is tenuous . on initial questioning , however , the patient denies any recent losses . on admission , the

the right ear , which is approximately 1 cm. in length and surrounded by powder burn . there is a lump in the right parietal region , which corresponds with the bullet seen on the computerized tomography scan . there is no bruising about the eyes or mastoid sinuses , and there is no fluid from the nose or ears . the neck was supple , and without adenopathy . the lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . the heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm and no murmur , rub or gallop are appreciated . the abdomen is soft , nontender , nondistended , without hepatosplenomegaly . there are no masses and the bowel sounds are present . the extremities are well perfused and there is no clubbing , cyanosis or edema . neurological : examination revealed a patient who was alert and

prior to his admission , the patient 's gunshot wound was sutured close in the emergency room . the patient was placed on suicide precautions , and was hydrated with an infusion of intravenous fluid . the patient was seen in consultation by the psychiatry service , who began a battery of testing , which continues at the time of discharge . the consulting psychiatrist recommended a minimum of 2 point restraints at all times , and recommended the patient be monitored by a sitter . allowing the patient to ambulate was not recommended . from a medical standpoint , the patient did well . he was initially admitted to the neurological intensive care unit where he was closely monitored during the first two days of his hospitalization . the chief obstacle was bringing his blood pressure under control and this was ultimately achieved with a combination of captopril and nifedipine . after his blood pressure had stabilized , the patient was transferred to the neurology ward . close monitoring demonstrated his blood pressure to be stable and within an acceptable rang on his dosage regimen . the psychiatry service followed up extensively with the patient , and his psychiatric progress is detailed in the psychiatry transfer note . by the 7th hospital day , the patient was medically stable . he had undergone full psychiatric evaluation , and was prepared for transfer to a psychiatric

dilated cardiomyopathy , inferior myocardial infarction , and anterior mediastinal masses admitted with acute onset of pulmonary edema . in the setting of inadvertently decreasing lasix from 80 mg. po 40 mg. a day mr. bridge had sudden onset dyspnea after approximate day and a half prodrome culminating in severe dyspnea . upon arrival in the emergency room mr. bridge 's saturations were in the mid 80s and he was promptly rendered more comfortable with high flow oxygen , morphine , and nitrates and intravenous lasix . chest x-ray was relatively unrevealing for interstitial or alveolar edema and with clinical improvement ensued with the immediate therapy in the emergency room as noted . the patient denied angina , syncope , preceding worsening orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations , chest pain , hematemesis or melena . past medical history : is notable for an inferior myocardial infarction , restrictive and obstructive lung disease with an fev1 of .9 and fvc of 1.34 and a moderate at best response to bronchodilators , and a negative sestamibi scan in december , 1999 apart from a severe fixed inferolateral defect , systolic dysfunction with recent echocardiography revealing an lvid of 62 mm. and ejection fraction of 28 percent , moderate mitral regurgitation and mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 33 and a mean gradient of 19 and a valve area of 1.4 cm. squared . in addition , mr. bridge has an anterior mediastinal mass 2x2x1.7 cm. by recent computerized tomography scan without surrounding or adjacent adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease apart from bronchiectasis . his cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ana , negative spep , upep and benz-jones proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative . the patient lives on ewi with his wife . he is a non-smoker and drinks rare alcohol . physical examination : the patient was a very pleasant man who appeared his stated age . blood pressure was 155/60 , heart rate 70 with occasional premature ventricular contractions , respirations 14 . mr. bridge was dyspneic speaking in short sentences initially on high flow oxygen . jugular venous pressure was 8 with a brisk inspiratory descent . there was no thyromegaly . carotids were 2+ . breath sounds were decreased at the bases only with distant heart sounds and a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur consistent with aortic stenosis with gallavardin like radiation to the apex . abdomen : soft , nontender with hepatosplenomegaly , or hepatojugular reflex , bruits or pulsations . there was no rash and no edema and the neurological examination was non-focal . laboratory data : notable for a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.6 , bun 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 104 , hematocrit 42 , white count 8.7 , platelet count 235 and a pt of 12.9 seconds . the urinalysis was negative . the troponin i was less than .4 and the creatine kinase was 114 . chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases . the electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations . after a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent . prior to catheterization a vq scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for pe with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung . subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and d-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent . it was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto . coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries . after a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute . based upon these findings it was felt that mr. bridge most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state . in hospital he was seen by

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who has had several recent admissions to oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital for respiratory insuffiencey most often secondary to pneumonia . he was most recently discharged from oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital on 03/06/99 and was then transferred to linghs county medical center from which he was discharged on 03/20/99 . the patient was doing relatively at home until one day prior to admission he complained discomfort over a suprapubic catheter area . the patient had missed his usual monthly change of his suprapubic catheter and felt discomfort and noticed some blood at the site of the catheter . the patient was brought to the emergency room one day prior to admission where he was evaluated by urology and had his catheter changed . the patient at that time noted slight shortness of breath but was sent home anyway . on the day of admission the patient noticed increasing shortness of breath . the patient was noted to be confused and to be disoriented toward the end of the day after complaining of shortness of breath for most of the day . the patient denies any recent upper respiratory infections , no fevers , no chills , no change in cough , sputum . he also denies any chest pain . no orthopnea . no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea . the patient had been taking his usual medications and using his nasal oxygen at home . by the time the patient arrived at the oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital emergency room he was in moderate respiratory distress . his initial blood gases on 40% 02 was p02 102 , pc02 115 , ph 7.11 . the patient was given respiratory therapy in the way of nebulizer treatments in the oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital emergency room because of a longstanding desire by patient and family to refrain from intubation to be considered do not resuscitate . the patient was not intubated . however he was transferred to the medical intensive care unit where he received continuous respiratory therapy in theway of albuterol nebulizers as well as nasal oxygen , intravenous steroids and intravenous antibiotics . a chest x-ray in the oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital emergency room showed new changes on his chest x-ray on top of his usual severe bilateral emphysema_____ with scarring in both lungs . there were new air space opacifications in the left apex and the right lower lobe . these were thought to be consistent either with pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema . past medical history : associated medical problems include : 1. atonic bladder with a suprapubic tube . 2. anxiety . 3. coronary artery disease with a history of angina in the distant past . 4. history of colon cancer with a colectomy in the past . medications on admission : 1. ativan 1 mg po twice a day . 2. trusopt 1 gtt left eye three

respiratory rate 25 . he was in moderate respiratory distress . his temperature was 98f . he had a normal head , eyes , ears , nose and throat exam . neck exam revealed no jugular venous distention and no masses . lung exam revealed decreased breath sounds as well as crackles in the bases . there were no wheezes or rhonchi . heart exam revealed a soft s1 and s2 , no murmur was heard , no s3 . abdomen was soft , nontender with no masses palpable . rectal exam was unremarkable with stool heme negative . neurological exam revealed an alert and oriented x 3 elderly male . he moved all extremities . deep tendon reflexes were symmetrical in all extremities . laboratory and radiologic data : sodium 148 , potassium 3.4 , glucose 174 , p02 102 , pc02 115 , ph 7.11 on 40% 02 . blood urea nitrogen 11 , creatinine .6 , uric acid 3.0 , alkaline phosphatase 78 , creatinine phosphokinase isoenzymes too low , hematocrit 41 , white blood cell count 11.6 . urine analysis showed 20-50 white blood cells and 3-5 red blood cells . electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 123 beats per minute compared to previous electrocardiogram of 1/29 there were no significant changes . hospital course : the patient was stabilized in the medical intensive care unit . he stayed in the unit for about one day . during that period of time he received nebulizer treatments with albuterol . he was also started on intravenous ticarcillin for possible gram negative pneumonia . he was diuresed with intravenous lasix to which he responded with at lease a 2l urine output on the first day and 1.5l the second day . after one day in the medical intensive care unit the patient was stable enough to go to the floor where he continued the rest of his treatment . this consisted of continued nebulizer treatments as well as intravenous antibiotics and intravenous solu-medrol . as the patient 's diuresis continued his respiratory status improved . a chest x-ray showed clearing of the opacities in the chest x-ray that were consistent with pulmonary edema because he continued to have some abnormality in the right lower lobe . the patient was continued on antibiotics for possible pneumonia . the antibiotic chosen was levaquin 500 mg 1 tab per day . this was started on 4/2/99 and should be continued for ten days . the ticarcillin was stopped after two days when it was felt that he did not have a serious pneumonia . the patient 's respiratory status continued to improve but towards the last 2-3 days of his hospitalization the amount of improvement was minimal . it was felt that his respiratory status has been maximally treated by then . the patient 's major improvement came after the first two days with brisk diuresis with lasix . while in the oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital the patient on 4/4/99 complained of mild epigastric discomfort because he was put in cimetidine while in the intensive care unit for prophylaxis against peptic ulcer disease . the patient was upgraded to prilosec 20 mg per day for possible treatment of gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease . the patient did have any nausea , vomiting or evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding . the patient 's abdominal pain should be followed over the next week or so in case it does not respond to prilosec . while in oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital the patient was never able to get out of bed and walk independently . it is hoped that when he is transferred to a rehab facility that he will continue with physical therapy to regain his strength and regain independence in activities of daily living . discussion with the family regarding the possibility of sending him to a nursing home was entertained however the family strongly refused to allow him to go a nursing home . they wanted the patient to return to his home after a stay at a rehab facility . condition on discharge : the patient 's respiratory status was stable . i think his breathing was as good as to be expected with the amount of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease he had . he needed to go to a rehab facility for continued respiratory therapy and for physical therapy to increase his muscle strength . medications on discharge : 1. albuterol 2.5 mg in 2.5 normal saline q4h . 2. heparin 5000 units subcutaneously twice a day . 3. ativan .5 mg twice a day . 4. nasal oxygen 3l per minute . 5. levaquin
