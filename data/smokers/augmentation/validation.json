e. coli . principal procedure : mri / mra . other procedures : echocardiogram , neurovascular ultrasound . history : patient is a 73-year-old retired cook with a history of cervical myelopathy , who is admitted for new left hemiparesis . he had undergone c-spine surgery for spinal stenosis with a question of myelopathy and radiculopathy in 1992 with residual spastic paresis and monoparesis of the left upper extremity , but was ambulatory until a day prior to admission . at his baseline , he was able to perform limited tasks with his left upper extremity , and was clearly able to move his hand and able to ambulate . he also at baseline has had urinary and fecal urgencies / incontinence . his history is now that he has had a week of progressive left upper extremity weakness , to the point of being unable to move the left hand and one day of being unable to walk secondary to left leg weakness with a marked tendency to fall leftward . past medical history : notable for anemia , hypercholesterolemia , narcolepsy for the past 6 years on dexedrine , impotence with decreased testosterone , status post implant , peptic ulcer disease , status post duodenal resection , cervical stenosis , status post decompression '92 , hernia , status post herniorrhaphy . allergies : no known drug allergies . medications on admission : dexedrine 5 mg per day and motrin 600 mg tid . physical examination : on admission , older , black gentleman in no acute distress with left upper extremity flex across his chest . his temperatureis 98.9 . his pressure is 150/90 . rate 76 . respirations 16 . he was edentulous . he had mild copper wiring . he has a i / vi systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border . heart sounds were normal and regular . breath sounds were equal bilaterally with course rhonchi . he had a midline abdominal scar and a reducible umbilical hernia . abdomen was otherwise soft and nontender . he had 2+ carotids , no bruits . he had gynecomastia . rectal was guaiac negative with brown stool , good tone but unable to squeeze . extremities : 1+ right posterior tibialis , 2+ left posterior tibialis , no edema , ichthyotic changes were present . he had 0 left wrist flexion or extension while his left proximal muscles were 4 including his biceps and triceps . his right arm muscles were also in the range of 4/5. his hip flexion was 4+ on the right and 4- on the left ; extension 5 on the right , 4+ on the left ; knee flexion evidently trace on the right and 4- on the left with knee extension 5- on the left , 5 on the right ; knee flexion 4- on the left , trace on the right ; ankle dorsi flexion 4- on the left , trace on the right . reflexes 4+ overall in the upper extremities and 3+ overall in the lower extremities , an upgoing left toe and a down going right toe . his tone was increased on the left side and he had diminished pin prick and light touch in his left upper extremity and slightly in his left lower extremity with a similar finding for vibratory sense , but in an unreliable pattern . he occasionally had extinction in his left upper , greater than lower extremity , but this was fluctuating . mental state : he was awake , occasionally sleepy but easily aroused , oriented to self , oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital and the date . he was mildly perseverative and inattentive . coordination : his fine finger movements and rapid alternating movements were within normal limits . he was unable to stand without extensive assistance . laboratory data : sodium 141 , potassium 3.6 , bun 14 , creatinine 1.1 , hematocrit 37% , platelets 177 , white blood count 4.1 . chest x-ray showed degenerative joint disease , an ill defined left hemi-diaphragm without air space disease . on the lateral view , surgical clips in the abdomen . ekg showed normal sinus rhythm , no st or t wave changes . hospital course and treatment : mr. finger was admitted for what appeared to be a stroke syndrome involving his left middle cerebral artery territory . he underwent neurovascular doppler studies which showed no significant change in either common carotid or in the left common internal ophthalmic system . however , there were hemodynamic changes which raised the question of right siphon disease . he had normal cervical vertebral arteries . transcranial dopplers showed no abnormalities in the ophthalmic siphon systems , distal vertebrals , or proximal basilar artery . the proximal , middle , anterior and posterior cerebral arteries , however , could not be insinuated . over the course of the first hospital day , the patient 's exam deteriorated in a manner that appeared to be blood pressure dependent . he had been started on heparin from the time of his admission . a computerized tomography scan had showed multiple lacunes , right greater than left , and the deep gray and white matters suspicious for proximal middle cerebral artery stem occlusion or stenosis . mri / mra was performed with diffusion weighted images , showing subcortical white matter and basal ganglia infarcts , but preserved middle cerebral artery territory cortex . because of his blood pressure , dependence of his left sided extremities , the lower leg specifically , he was transferred to the intensive care unit where he underwent hypertensive therapy for several days . his systolic blood pressure goal was initially 170-190 , which he was able to achieve spontaneously for the most part . however , due to the absence of clear benefit at this level , and further deterioration in his left sided strength , this goal was increased and neo-synephrine was added to his regimen to achieve mean arterial pressures in the 110-120 range . this strategy and its incumbent risks , particularly in a patient on heparin , were discussed at length with both the patient and his family , who were very clear in wanting to proceed with all possible efforts to save the use of his left leg . while in the intensive care unit , his strength deteriorated from being able to hold his left leg off the bed up to several inches to loosing virtually all distal extremity strength , and having a 2-3/5 power in his proximal left leg groups . he also , as neo-synephrinewas tapered , developed mild sensory findings , in particular diminished large fiber sensibility in his left hand , although he at times , including near the end of his intensive care unit stay had a right gaze preference . in terms of exploring his visual space , he was able to look to the left , and it was not possible to elicit clear evidence for a field deficit . he was followed by speech and swallowing service , who assisted in the management of po intake which gradually improved , although he clearly had problems with manipulation of food in the left side of his mouth and would tend to accumulate a pouch of food in his left cheek . i should mention that his blood pressure therapy was at times limited by a severe headache , although he also had this off the pressor . he had several repeat imaging studies during his intensive care unit stay which showed further demarcation , but not extension of his prior infarct , both on computerized tomography scan and dwi images . additionally , he had a perfusion , diffusion mr study earlier on , which suggested the presence of viable penumbra , including the overlying cortex . he was transferred to the regular neurology floor once it became clear that he was not receiving any significant benefit from hypertensive therapy . at this time , his neurologic exam is notable for hemiplegia of his left arm , severe hemiparesis of his left leg , mild large fiber sensory loss in his left arm , and otherwise fairly intact mental status , cranial nerve function , and right sided motor and sensory function . we anticipate that he represents a good rehab potential . he will be discharged to rehab on a regimen of coumadin 5 mg po today then daily for an inr goal of 2-3 , ofloxacin 400 mg po bid to be discontinued on 11/05/96 , dexedrine 5 mg po qd , omeprazole 20mg po qd , erythromycin eye ointment ou bid , heparin at its present rate adjusting per partial

she complained of chest pain , which was diffuse , non-localizing without electrocardiogram changes and persisted for several days and then went away completely . she was oriented to person , place , time and purpose , she recalled three out of three objects at five minutes , she is able to do calculations . she maintained her fixation on the conversation well . the cranial nerve exam : pupils reactive to light , extra ocular movements show good upgaze up to 3 mm. , good down gaze . right lateral gaze , the right eye had 2 mm. of sclera showing , the left eye was normal , and there are a few beats of right beading nystagmus . the left lateral gaze , the left eye had 1 mm. of lateral sclera showing . disks were flat . sensory limb of the right eye corneal reflex is slowed , otherwise normal . seventh nerve weakness on the right in a central pattern is present . soft palate was in the midline and moved upward nicely , but did not respond to gag . tongue protrudes 2 cm. with slight

closely and should continue to show improvement . she is anticoagulated on coumadin and this has been stable . she is do not resuscitate in agreement with the wishes of her multiple family members . follow up computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown infarction in bilateral basis pontis , mid brain , the superior cerebellar areas , left thalamus , bilateral temporal lobes medially and inferiorly and left posterior communicating artery . the patient had fevers sporadically during this hospitalization with rising white blood counts . a chest x-ray documented a progressing left lower lobe infiltrate . initially this improved on clindamycin and cefotetan , but fevers recurred on this antibiotic regimen . sputum grew out klebsiella pneumoniae , and she was treated with gentamicin and ancef for 14 days intravenous ( bug being sensitive to these two drugs ) . a left pleural effusion developed and this was tapped with ultrasound guidance , and found to be sterile , and without evidence of empyema . the patient is on ciprofloxacin . the day of discharge is day #3 of 7 , after which antibiotics should be totally discontinued . she has developed bad thrush in this setting , she is not yet able to swallow and so she is on nystatin swish and spit five times a day . she also gets peridex to clean out her mouth . once her liver enzymes are completely normal , a seven day course of fluconazol may be helpful if the thrush is not spontaneously resolving off of antibiotics . she has been afebrile for greater than 10 days , including several days on oral antibiotics . the patient 's liver enzymes were noted to be elevated mid way through her hospital course , to about three times normal , especially the sgot and sgpt . these have spontaneously reversed , and are nearly normal at the time of discharge . a right upper quadrant ultrasound documented gallstones , without evidence of common bile duct dilatation or active cholecystitis . the exact cause of her liver enzyme elevation is unclear , but we are being careful about administering drugs , which might irritate the liver . the patient had a steady decline in her hematocrit during this hospitalization . iron studies are all entirely normal , her anemia is attributed to anemia or chronic disease with hypoproliferation as well as multiple phlebotomies . the plan is to give her folic acid , but not iron . the patient 's potassiums have been repeatedly low and require daily checks and repletion . this is thought due to the extensive course of gentamicin which she received . this must be carefully checked despite the standing order for potassium . the patient has had low sodiums during this hospitalization . this may due to her central nervous system process or her pulmonary process , with fluids administered as described , she should not have any problems from this . her sodiums were never below 130 . she does well with tube feeds . her tube feeds orders are as follow : full strength replete with fiber at 70 cc. per hour . in addition , the patient gets 250 cc. of juice ( not water ) three times a day . she also gets lactinex granules three packages in each bottle of tube feeds . she also gets metamucil one teaspoon with the first bolus of juice each day . please note that evaluation by the swallowing therapist , showed that the patient is aspirating at this time , but there is great hope from the nature of her deficit and the good movements of her tongue that normal swallowing should return soon . it is for this reason that she is discharged with an nasogastric tube and that no plans for g tube placement are made at this time . she has a history of of angina without myocardial infarction that has not been worked up . she did have brief chest pain twice during this admission that did not correlate with electrocardiogram changes . in the first week of november , her electrocardiogram showed t wave inversions in the lateral leads , correlating with an increase in the ldh , but not ck . this did not normalize with administration of isordil and the patient denied chest pain at this time . as of 4/7 , her electrocardiogram had reverted back to normal and there is no evidence of congestive heart failure or continued electrocardiogram changes , and chest pain is absent . her cholesterol was 350 here . she has been off of her hypercholesterol medicines . these can be restarted when it is deemed reasonable , in view of her acute disease and recently elevated liver enzymes . note that the liver enzymes were normal on admission , at which time she was taking all of the above cholesterol medicines . medications on discharge : metamucil 1 teaspoon q.d. , with first bolus of juice , juice 250

is referred for progressive angina . she had rheumatoid fever as a child and a heart murmur noted but no further testing . she has used antibiotic prophylaxis since 1980 . in 1980 she had quadruple coronary artery bypass graft surgery by dr. elks at feargunwake otacaa community hospital and did well until 1988 when she had exertional angina and a positive stress test and found that three or four grafts were occluded . in october , 1989 , dr. no re-did her bypass operation . she had a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 2 . in 1993 she had a ddd pacemaker for complete heart block . she had exertional angina at that time . in november , 1997 she had a small myocardial infarction as was transferred to ona hospital where a cardiac catheterization showed a tight left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending stenosis , high grade saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 stenosis and patent obtuse marginal 2 graft . she had normal left ventricular function with apical tip akinesis . since that time she has continued to have exertional left chest burning , radiating to the left neck and arm , relieved by nitroglycerin . she was turned down for re-do surgery at that time and did not have a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty . because these symptoms have been increasing , particularly at cardiac rehabilitation , she was referred here . in may , 1998 she had an exercise tolerance test in which her heart rate went to 112 and her blood pressure fell to 95 systolic . she had diffuse ischemic st segment changes and increased lung uptake and a reversible anterior and lateral defect . she has had no syncope . her cardiac risk factors are hypertension and elevated cholesterol . she has a very strong family history of coronary artery disease with a mother , sister and brother dying of myocardial infarction . she is a remote cigarette smoker . she also has a history of lactose intolerance , peptic ulcer disease , with a remote gastrointestinal bleed and multiple ectopic pregnancies and mid term miscarriages . she has had a total abdominal hysterectomy . social history : she is a widow for 20 years and retired 18 years from palmci she lives alone . her son , nertland is nearby and he works at the em nysonken medical center on verville . they live in ohio . physical examination : she is a healthy appearing female , 5 foot 120 pounds . her blood pressure was 120/70 , pulse 60 and regular . neck veins are not distended . respiratory rate 12 . carotids : no bruits . lungs were clear . cardiac : 1/6 systolic ejection murmur . abdomen was benign . peripheral pulses intact . neurological examination non-focal . laboratory data : on admission , includes an electrocardiogram that shows ddd pacing . hematocrit 39 percent , white blood cell count 4500 , pt and ptt normal . sodium 140 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 105 , carbon dioxide 30 , bun 24 , creatinine 1.0 . hospital course and treatment : the patient was admitted to the cardiac catheterization laboratory . there , her pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure 44/17 . her left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with dyskinesis of the apex . she had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction . her native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was an obtuse marginal branch . the saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded . the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded . the saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with no significant stenosis , but there was an outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery . this was considered her culprit lesion . this was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft . in addition , it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs . her left internal mammary artery was also unused . it was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead . she would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing . this was intermittent . the p wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed . the patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker . it was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure . her pacemaker was set to a vvi mode which sensed appropriately . she was in sinus rhythm with most of the time . when her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker , she had significant angina . carotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable . the situation was reviewed with dr. niste graft . he felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction . for this reason , it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates . the situation was reviewed with dr. no of the pacemaker service . on august 20 , under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a cpi unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .15 mm. , which permitted appropriate atrial sensing . there was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads . it just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode . she tolerated this well . her medications were resumed . she ambulated without difficulty and was discharged to home to be followed medically for her coronary artery disease following two

taken to the operating room where she underwent a neart total gastrectomy with a retrocolic bill-roth ii gastrojejunostomy reconstruction . in addition a small ventral hernia was noted upon abdominal exploration within a previous surgical incision . this was repaired . a needle jejunostomy catheter was placed at the time of her operation to facilitate postoperative nutrition . with regards to the cancer , there was a large mass along the greater curvature in the body of the stomach , and several perigastric lymph nodes which were taken with the specimen . in addition , there were at least two lymph nodes within the porta hepatis which were dissected free and taken en bloc with the specimen . the remainder of her abdomen was unremarkable without evidence of metastatic spread elsewhere , including the liver . the patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in good condition . the patient 's postoperative course was for the most part unremarkable . her wounds healed well without incident and the needle jejunostomy tube was utilized on the first postoperative day right up until the time of discharge , infusing vivonex t.e.n. the patient tolerated this without difficulty . the patient 's nasogastric tube was removed on the 3rd postoperative day , and with the passage of flatus and good bowel sounds noted , she was started on a liquid diet which was advanced slowly . she was seen by the dietician and was advised with regard to needing numerous small meals during the day rather than 3 larger meals as she previously was used to . her ambulation and mobilization increased gradually and by the time of discharge she was walking in the halls without assistance . as mentioned , her wounds healed well without incident and the staples were removed on the 10th postoperative day just prior to discharge . she had some difficulties with confusion in the early postoperative period which were attributable to her advanced age and a sundowning effect . these problems resolved by the 4th or 5th postoperative day and she remained lucid and alert for the remainder of her hospital stay . surgical pathology report was completed prior to discharge which revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma ulcerating and extending through the wall into the serosa of the stomach . metastatic carcinoma was present in 3 of 3 lymph nodes . the gastric resection margins were free of carcinoma . the patient was set for discharge on the 11th postoperative day doing well . on the day prior to discharge she complained of some dysuria , a urine specimen was obtained , which showed numerous white cells consistent with a urinary tract infection . she was started empirically on bactrim , while culture and sensitivity results were pending and remained

to be performed . chest x-ray showed significant kiphosis but otherwise no significant lesions at all . past medical history : negative . past surgical history : negative . medications on admit : none . allergies : none . smoking none . family history : negative . alcohol none . social history : lives in an old age facility but is quite active and quite independent . physical examination : the patient was sitting upright and was not drooling and was able to swallow her secretions although she did have a very wet voice which got progressively more hoarse during the examination . she had no respiratory distress but did choose to sit in an upright position . her ear examination was normal . nasal examination was normal . oral cavity was normal . neck : revealed fullness in the submental and suprahyoid regions with mild tenderness which was consistent with edema of the soft tissues without significant mass . neck : otherwise normal and the trachea was midline . hypopharyngeal examiantion revealed a severely edematous , yellowish-white epiglottis with significantly edematous base of tongue which had marked watery edema . the left pyriform was obliterated by edema . the right pyriform was narrowed by edema . the epiglottis was so edematous that is was pushed back posteriorly and abutted the posterior oropharynx completely obscuring the larynx . the patient had no stridor and it was clear that she must be breathing around the epiglottis . there was blood oozing out from the left lateral epiglottis at the region consistent with its base although this was unclear for identification secondary to edema and it was possible that she may have had a lesion in this area . lungs : clear . heart : regular rate and rhythm . s1 and s2 , no murmurs , rubs or gallops . abdomen : soft , nontender , positive bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly , no bruits . no masses . extremities : normal . back : showed significant thoracic kiphosis . laboratory examination : revealed a wbc count of 11.6 , h and h of 10.7 and 31.7 , platelet count of 268 , differential 94 polys , 0 bands , 5 lymphs , one mono . as noted above , lateral neck film revealed marked edema of the epiglottis . the chest x-ray showed signficant kiphosis with several areas of increased interstitial markings but otherwise negative . hospital course : the patient was felt to have epiglottitis , possibly secondary to a malignancy , especially in her age group . she was started on iv ceftriaxone two grams and was given humidification . due to the marked amount of edema , it was felt that she should go the operating room emergently for elective intubation . she was taken to the operating room at approximately 2:00 a.m. which was approximately one hour after being evaluated by ent and was intubated awake over a fiberoptic bronchoscope through the left nares with nasal anesthetic only with a #6 endotracheal tube . the patient was sedated . direct laryngoscopy was performed but this revealed only a large amount of base of tongue edema with minimally visible epiglottis which was also significantly edematous and no distinct mass or lesion could be noted . she was transferred to the sicu where she was kept sedated and was given ceftriaxone one gram q. 12 h. as well as iv steroids for the first 24 hours consisting of decadron 8 mg q. 8 h. x 3 doses in addition to 10 mg that she received in the emergency room on the way down to the operating room . her initial hospital course while intubated was significant for an episode of atrial fibrillation which she went into in the operating room . at the end of the case she had had a central line placed also for frequent blood draws at the request of the sicu house office . her episode of atrial fibrillation as we planned to take her from the operating room after both the intubation and central line placement had been completed . she had no trouble with blood pressure with this atrial fibrillation with rates going up to 150 . she was given a dose of digoxin but broke spontaneously approximately two minutes after the digoxin was given . ekg and enzymes were obtained and showed the first degree av block that she had had on her preoperative ekg but no other findings at all . she continued in normal sinus rhythm and was transferred to the icu where she was monitored . her blood gases and o2 saturations correlated well and we used o2 saturations to follow her as well as venous gases and she continued to maintain good o2 saturation . she was kept ventilated because she was kept sedated . she went into an svt the afternoon after intubation and a decision was made to digitalize her , keeping her level between approximately .6 and 1 . she continued in sinus rhythm after this episode of svt and again had no problems with her blood pressure during that . her edema decreased over the next two days and repeat fiberoptic examination on both 4/3 and 4/4 revealed decreasing edema . on 4/5/91 in the icu under controlled conditions , she was electively extubated and had no problems . she was kept on ceftriaxone but no further steroids were given . examination at that time revealed question of a lesion at the left lateral glossoepiglottic fold . otherwise her examination was normal with good visualization of the larynx and significant decrease in size of the epiglottis . of note , during her first hospital day when she received steroids her blood sugars did increase significantly and therefore she was started on insulin . once the steroids were stopped , the insulin was able to be stopped . tube feedings were started on 4/3/91 and the ng tube was discontinued on 4/5/91 prior to extubation to give a better look at the epiglottis prior to extubating her . after extubation she was watched in the icu for 24 hours and she did well except for some episodes of confusion happening the night of extubation and also the next morning . again , mi was ruled out and metabolic tests were within normal limits . o2 saturations looked good . it was felt that this was a mild episode of icu psychosis . she was followed on the regular floor 24 hours after extubation and had no further problems with her airway . she was maintained on ceftriaxone and then switched to augmentin and remained afebrile . her white counts came down . blood cultures which had been drawn at the time of intubation were negative . she had a geriatric consult due to her confusion and they suggested as we had already done to stop all sedatives and sleeping medications . cardiology was contacted and recommended that given her history she should be taken off all digoxin and just watched and that her svts may have been just secondary to stress of intubation . unfortunately the episodes of atrial fibrillation and svt were apparently not documented well enough in terms of ekg strips to aid cardiology and therefore , they gave us an informal consult so that no formal consult will be found in this chart . nonetheless , their input was greatly appreciated and she was taken off of digoxin and had no further problems with her heart . her mental status began to clear under the family 's request . disposition : on 4/9/91 she was sent home on a week of augmentin and will followup in the ent clinic . our plan will be to establish whether or not she truly had an epiglottic lesion . she , of note , had no history of foreign body ingestion or any abrasion or trauma to this area . if she does have a lesion , then we may entertain , given her age , the possibility of radiating this lesion as opposed to putting her through laryngectomy . discharge medications are augmentin 500 mg t.i.d. x 7 days . the patient is to followup in the ent clinic in approximately one week . discharge diagnosis : epiglottitis , question secondary to epiglottic malignancy . rg556/4903 eento works , m.d. nl6 d : 04/10/91 batch : 5391 report : u5989c79 t : 04/10/91 dicatated by : sa jescwierst , m.d.

congestive heart failure . a thallium stress test showed equivocal st segment changes with fixed apical and inferior defects . his coronary risk factors include cigarette smoking , obesity , a family history of coronary disease , and elevated serum cholesterol . he also has a history of atrial fibrillation with sinus pauses during sleep apnea . on june 4 , 1993 , he underwent cardiac catheterization . he was found to have an occluded right coronary artery , 70% distal left main lesion , 80% proximal ramus lesion , and his left ventricular ejection shows preserved function except for akinesis of the inferior wall . his ejection fraction was 50% , a carotid duplex study showed plaqueing but no critical lesions . past medical history : as above . social history : he has a wife

was reasonable to proceed . on june 24 , 1993 , dr. lenni breutzoln performed triple coronary bypass surgery . he placed a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , single saphenous vein to the posterior descending artery with 170 cc. per minute flow and a single saphenous vein to the circumflex with 140 cc. per minute flow . he weaned easily off cardiopulmonary bypass . he had no hemodynamic difficulties . he was able to wean from the ventilator , but he did have marginal oxygenation throughout . he did revert back to atrial fibrillation . he was extubated within forty eight hours . he was transferred out of the surgical intensive care unit on june 26 . he reverted back to atrial fibrillation that required digoxin , and verapamil to control . he could not be converted back to normal sinus rhythm even with a trial of quinaglute . he also had anemia and he was seen in consultation by the nutrition service . he was advised to have an ideal body weight of 178 pounds , and clearly a 2300 calorie diet was appropriate for him . weight reduction would be important in the long term management of his coronary disease . he was treated with digoxin and diuretics along with ace inhibitors because of his depressed left ventricular function . he was able to ambulate although somewhat slowly because of his rapid atrial fibrillation . it was considered to obtain a pulmonary consultation on a formal basis , but it was then felt that he would do better by healing fully from his surgery , because he really had little in the way of pulmonary complications , despite

{"id": 30, "label": 1, "text": "principle diagnosis : metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast . other problems : 1. hyponatremia , 1-13-94 . 2. pulmonary embolus , 1-14-94 . 3. diarrhea , nausea and vomiting , fever . 4. history of ovarian cyst resection , 1975 . history of present illness : the patient is a 49 year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with pbse and ccss support ending june 1994 . she was admitted on 1-5-94 for fever , chest wall ulceration , cellulitis and pain control . the patient first presented in october 1991 with a tender right axillary mass . a mammogram done in november 1990 was negative . however , mammography repeated in october 1991 showed bilateral breast masses , suspicious for carcinoma . fine needle aspiration on october 23 , 1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters . staging evaluation included normal liver function tests , normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray . bone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally . dr. berca gachfrum performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on november 4 , 1991 . the right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated , grade iii out of iii infiltrating ductal carcinoma . the margins were free of tumor , but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma . furthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer . the left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion . estrogen receptor was 0% by erica . the patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage . therefore she had a stage iii-a adenocarcinoma of the breast . since she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor , she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy . the patient was treated with cmsap , which is cytoxan , methotrexate , leukovoranrescue , 5-fu , adriamycin and prednisone for four cycles . there were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression . however , following cycle 4 , she developed a flu-like illness , followed by fever , nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion . abgs showed a po2 of 79 , ph 7.44 , po2 33 . chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates . the differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis , mycoplasma , chlamydia . basically in december 1993 , she returned to the hem / onc clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied . although she had mediastinal recurrence , bone scan , head and liver ct were negative for metastatic disease . she was thus started on a protocol of high dose chemotherapy with gcsf and peripheral stem cell support . complications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis . she also developed klebsiella uti after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy . it was treated with gent and cipro . re-staging done in april 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis . in may 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and velban and methotrexate , which required some red cell transfusions . in mid may she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a uti with blood clots in the urine . the patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100 . she has also been having diarrhea since november and her other complaints of admission include confusion , nausea and vomiting . we will include a very thorough hpi with this dictation that was done by dr. wedleung . past medical history : significant for metastatic breast cancer , complicated by fever and neutropenia . utis , obstruction of the right subclavian vein and right brachial cephalic vein , herpes zoster . status post ovarian cyst resection in 1975 . she had menarche at age 15 . she used the pill for five years in the past . she is g 2 , p 2 with spontaneous vaginal deliveries . she has a history of easy bruis ability . she is allergic to augmentin which gives her a rash . medications : ms contin , msir , and percocet . family history : noncontributory . social history : married with two children . she worked as an occupational therapist at a professional center for handicapped children . she denies tobacco and drug use and drinks ethanol socially . physical examination : a cachectic white female . t 100.1 , p 104 , blood pressure 130/90 , heart rate of 16 , she was sating 95% on room air . heent - pupils were miotic , measuring 2 mm but responsive to light . neck - tender on the leftside with no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly . lungs were clear . chest actually had a 5 x 7 cm necrotic area on the left chest wall with some pus . cardiovascular - normal . abdomen - normal . there was no hsm . extremities - her left arm was very swollen . it was tested with no voluntary movement except at the finger tips . there was no edema elsewhere in her extremities , only the left arm . neuro - the patient was oriented to place , but had difficulty with recent memory . she also had mild weakness in the left extremities , both upper and lower . cranial nerves ii - xii were grossly intact . toes were downgoing . laboratory data : of note - na 133 , k 4 , wbc 8.82 , hematocrit 35.1 , platelets 229 . pt 13.8 with an inr of 1.3 , ptt 25.5 , total protein was 6.2 , albumin 3.4 , globulin of 2.8 , calcium of 9.1 , phos 2.7 , mag 2.1 , urea 3.7 . alt was elevated at 240 , ast 85 , ldh 305 , alk phos 85 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , direct bili was .8 . cholesterol 188 , triglyceride was 127 . ua - trace protein , trace ketones , positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1+ bacteria . chest x-ray - showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia . in summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell ca , status post chemotherapy with cmsap and pvsc and xrt who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall . the keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea . when she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with iv antibiotics . so she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her . also at the time of admission we were also considering palliative taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined . she refused the taxol therapy so that was not done . another major issue with this patient was pain control . she had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion . so pain control was a big issue so she was on ms contin and msir at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management . one of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at c6-c7 interface on 1-6-94 . after that the patient had minimal relief of pain . however , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her . so accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up . she is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch . she is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours . we can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain . other things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead ct for her on the 8th of january because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking . we went ahead and got a head ct scanand it showed no enhancing lesions . in addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that . that has been stable . the patient on january 13 became hyponatremic . her sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 . a renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as siadh . we proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it . we had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction . in addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient 's sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116. so that has really improved . we suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day . on the 14th of january , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with hampton 's hump . also a vq scan obtained the next day showed high probability for pe . so we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s. her inr is 2.3 . we want her inr to remain between 2 and 3 . so if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night . however , we would leave it at 2.5 for now . other major issues - as a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also . we put her on nifedipine ir , sl and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol . so on discharge she is on atenolol 100 . if needed to you can give her some nifedipine sl to decrease her blood pressure . the patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so i think that fluid restriction should help with that . she is also a little dry . the patient is on oxygen . ever since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen . she was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters . we would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well . the complications that i have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure . disposition : discharge medications - baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d. , mvi one tablet p.o. q.d. , mycostatin powder tp q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d. condition on discharge : fair . she remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema . she is to go to the necsoncardel medical center for more chronic care . follow-up is with dr. wedleung in the hem / onc in two weeks . the appointment has already been made . the patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain primarily and her difficulty breathing . dictated by : jeabriharl figefreiermfothgrendcajaque , m.d. attending : la inemacistin prontmandes , m.d. hd45 sy882/1177 batch : 020 index no. yjqi3j9vu6 d : 01/25/94 t : 01/25/94 "}

( on 02/06 , his bilirubin had been 7.2 with 6 direct ) . his arterial blood gas on 50% was po2 92 , pco2 24 , and ph 7.46 . his chest x-ray showed bilateral nodular infiltrates . hospital course : the patient was admitted for work-up of his cholestatic jaundice picture along with work-up for his pulmonary process and treatment of both . in terms of pulmonary function , it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a bactrim failure for pcp although this was unusual . he was started on pentamidine , especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to bactrim . the patient was also covered with erythromycin and gentamicin for coverage of community acquired pneumonias and gram negative rods . he was given supplemental oxygen . in terms of his liver abnormalities , it was felt that viral hepatitis was in the differential as well as several opportunistic infections of the liver but also was felt that bactrim could be a cause of these abnormalities . titers for cmv and epstein-barr virus were sent and a titer for toxoplasma was sent . stool was sent for ova and parasites . gastrointestinal was consulted . initially , the patient did well in terms of his pre-status and required less oxygen . however , on 02/10/91 , his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased . actually in reviewing the records at this point , it appears that pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of erythromycin and gentamicin , the patient 's respiratory status worsened and his ldh climbed so he began pentamidine on 02/10/91 . on 02/11/91 , the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50% facemask but then required more oxygen , dropped his o2 saturations , and was intubated on 02/11/91 . he was transferred to the intensive care unit on 12/12/90 on gentamicin , vancomycin , pentamidine , and prednisone . also of note at that point , hepatitis c virus serologies had come back positive . however , at this point , his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12.1 and total being 14.1 . the patient 's abdominal ct scan showed no liver disease and no obstruction . the patient 's liver function tests appeared to improve . the patient 's penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on acyclovir . on 02/13/91 , the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage performed which showed a toluidine blue with many pneumocysts noted . no other cultures grew out and the patient 's clinical status deteriorated . the patient required 100% oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on the ventilator . he required elevated ventilatory pressures with pips often above 60 . fortunately , no evidence of baratroma was ever discerned . however , the patient 's respiratory status continued to decline and we were unable to maintain oxygen saturations above 80% even using reverse i to e ventilation , paralysis , sedation , and other modes of ventilation . patient underwent liver biopsy on 02/16/91 and the results of this were pending when the patient died . the patient actually developed decreasing counts with white count as low as 1.75 , hematocrit as low as 26 , and platelets as low as 68 noted on 02/15/91 . these were supported with blood products and hematology was consulted . they felt that it was most likely secondary to bactrim and these actually were getting better when the patient died . bone marrow biopsy was not attempted . discussions were begun with the family regarding limits of supportive care . due to continued worsening pulmonary status and an overall grim prognosis , the family decided , in consultation with the medical team , to withdraw ventilatory support . this was done on the evening of 02/18/91 . patient expired after the endotracheal tube was withdrawn at 6:40 p.m. disposition : the patient died in hospital . an autopsy will be performed . an autopsy was performed as per the family 's wishes . we221/9850 tako c. inske , m.d. , ph. jt2 ff2 d : 02/18/91 batch : 8600 report : v7238b57 t : 02/20/91 dicatated by : lato l. tikfreierm , m.d. cc : 1. lerma n. wynbrantesxell , m.d. 2. ana v. a , m.d. 3. dalli a. seen , m.d 4. arc n. seen , m.d.

of 90 lymphocytes and l0 monocytes in tube number four and two white cells and 600 red cells with a differential of 5 polys , 90 lymphocytes , and 5 monocytes in tube number one . patient also had an mri scan of the head which showed a lesion in the left pons consistent with multiple sclerosis . serum igg was elevated at l,520 . spep showed an elevated gamma spike of l.83 and was otherwise within normal limits . the patient underwent lenti pidesrah non community hospital multiple sclerosis treatment , group ii protocol with cytoxan and acth induction with the plan for maintenance methylprednisolone after discharge . she tolerated the protocol medications well except for some nausea and vomiting which was relatively well controlled with anti-emetic medication and also some very mild hematuria to the tune of 20 to 25 red blood cells on micro . this was , in fact , consistent with the fact that she had an indwelling foley placed on admission after post-void residual was noted to be 200 cc of urine . she received occupational therapy and physical therapy during the hospitalization . 2) anemia - patient had a steady drop in hematocrit from the admission value of 43.5 to the range of about 3l by hospital day number eight which remained stable at this point . she had guaiac negative stools , no menses , no significant hematuria , and no signs of hemolysis . work-up included an iron of l24 , tibc of 207 , a ferritin of l24 , and bl2 and folate were pending but unlikely to be contributing to this acute drop . haptoglobin was l79 with a normal bilirubin and a normal ldh . glucose was 6 , phosphate deficiency was checked with a normal level of 25 being measured , and reticulocyte count of less than 0.l% was noted at one point with follow-up reticulocyte count of 0.l% noted on the day prior to discharge . this was felt to be consistent with decreased bone marrow production of new red cells and possibly a hematocrit drop secondary to in-hospital phlebotomy with some dilutional component secondary to intravenous and p.o. hydration . patient did not show coincident decrease in white count or platelet count . a clot was sent to the blood bank , however , the patient did not require a transfusion . she did receive bactrim for a urinary tract infection and this medication was discontinued given its potential for aplasia in the bone marrow . patient will be followed up with subsequent cbc on the september , the september , the september , and the septemberth of 2006 to assure that her hematocrit recovers . 3) urinary tract infection - patient had too numerous to count white cells on urinalysis on 08/15/90 and was thus begun on bactrim ds one tablet p.o. b.i.d. subsequently , urine culture prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy grew out pan sensitive e. coli , greater than l00,000 including sensitivities to bactrim . patient received a seven day course of bactrim ds one tablet b.i.d. with resolution of symptoms and subsequent negative culture . her foley will be discontinued at discharge and she will continue home straight catheterizations given her post-void residual of 200 cc on admission per the visiting nurse . disposition : discharge medications : multivitamins one tablet p.o. q.d. , halcion 0.l25 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. ( forty tablets , no refills ) , and acthar 40 units intramuscularly q.d. times two days and then 20 units intramuscularly q.d. times three days . condition on discharge : stable . disposition is to home . follow-up care will be per dr. critche at the cockdownbayscot waredoun inmountsonente memorial and per dr. a or at the retelk county medical center with regard to the rys memorial hospital protocol . ________________________________ mj092/0660 a l. or , m.d. bi89 d : 08/21/90 batch : 2695 report : x9178r1 t : 08/25/90 dicatated by : trangca f. or , m.d. ou12 "}

maryland in oakwest on 01/10/92 with a headache , nausea and worsening confusion as well as incomprehensible speech . she was not able to follow commands and had a low grade temperature with a question of a right facial droop . she was then transferred to box memorial hospital nursing home where a lumbar puncture revealed a few red blood cells and white blood cells but also showed marked xanthochromia . she did not reveal any meningismus . the patient was transferred to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital and referred under the care of dr. telshey peg by dr. rerhea t. hearing of box

mevacor and with a history of of calan , ornade and lasix . allergies : there were no known drug allergies . habits : did not include tobacco or alcohol ingestion . physical examination : on physical examination on admission the patient was somnolent but conversant , oriented x 1 only . chest was clear . heart had regular rate and rhythm . neck was supple without mass or bruits . the abdomen was soft and nontender . calves were nontender . on neuro exam the patient was somnolent but readily arousable to conversation . she looked at the examiner and carried an appropriate conversation but only for seconds at a time . her face was strong and symmetric . she felt pin prick and light touch bilaterally to the face symmetrically . her extra ocular movements were full without nystagmus . she sees light only od. which is chronic . she reads large print os. her tongue was midline and her palate elevated symmetrically . she could not maintain her arms long enough to detect drift . she also lifted both legs and flexes at the knees . her grip is 5/5 bilaterally . ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion were 5/5 bilaterally . laboratory data : on admission her labs. were notable for a hematocrit of 41.9 , white blood count 11.1 , mcv 87 , sodium 142 , potassium 3.0 , chloride 101 , bicarb. 29.3 , bun 13 , creatinine 0.9 and sugar 134 . a head ct performed on 01/10/92 revealed no cerebrovascular accident and no evidence of acute blood . mra / mri revealed a left internal carotid artery aneurysm about 7 mm. in width . hospital course : the patient was admitted to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital where a four vessel cerebral angiogram was performed on 01/13/92 . this revealed a lobulated aneurysm at the p. comm. origin on the left . this was a left internal carotid artery aneurysm . the internal carotid arteries and middle cerebral artery showed irregularity of caliber probably due to atherosclerosis . after much discussion , endovascular treatment with gd coils were recommended . the patient underwent coiling on 01/14/92 . this showed that 60-70% of the distal aneurysm was obliterated by the coils . one coil protruded into the lumen of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm . it was thought that the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage was low but still substantial from the untreated proximal lobe . also the risk of ischemia or infarct from the internal carotid artery coil could lead to thromboembolism . therefore the lowest overall risk was thought to be a craniotomy to obliterate the aneurysm and possibly remove the protruding coil . therefore after discussion in detail with sister rora dose , a left pterional craniotomy was performed on 01/15/92 . at this time it was noted that the left internal carotid artery aneurysm was mostly within the cavernous sinus and the extracavernous portion was extremely atherosclerotic . therefore no clip was possible and the patient underwent a muslin wrapping of the aneurysm . the patient postoperatively was able to open her eyes to voice and name . her pupils were equal and reactive and she was able to localize with the left upper extremity as well as raise the right upper extremity above the bed . her consciousness as well as her strength improved gradually and the patient was referred for rehabilitation at a chronic care center . discharge diagnosis : subarachnoid hemorrhage and left internal carotid artery aneurysm . procedures : on 01/13/92 four vessel cerebral angiogram . 01/14/92 embolization of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm . 01/15/92 left pterional craniotomy for left internal carotid artery aneurysm with exploration and muslin wrap of the aneurysm . complications : there were no noted complications . medications on discharge : include heparin

or head trauma during her accident . she had no other musculo-skeletal or systemic signs of trauma except for her left patellar fracture . at this time the patient was admitted to the orthopedic trauma service and informed consent was obtained for open reduction , internal fixation of her left patellar fracture . after the patient was cleared by anesthesia and consent was obtained the patient was taken to the operating room on april 27 , 2002 . she underwent open reduction , internal fixation of her left patellar fracture . there were no complications and a hemo dressing was placed . the patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit and then to the floor in stable condition . there was no evidence of anesthesia difficulties due to her past medical history of asthma . at this point the initially plan was to have no active knee extension , to use a continuous passive motion machine with a goal of 0 to 45 degrees range of motion . if she was to be up and ambulating weight bearing as tolerated . when she was up and out of bed her knee was to be locked in full extension . on postoperative check there were no active issues . on postoperative day number one she had no complaints . she had initial fevers of 102.2 postoperatively but this temperature spike declined and she was afebrile after postoperative day number one . her hemovac had minimal output of 30 cc. in the first 12+ hours of insertion . as such the drain was discontinued on postoperative day number one . she was using her continuous passive motion machine on the first day postoperatively from 0-15 degrees . she was weight bearing as tolerated but on postoperative day number one was only able to stand at the edge of the bed . her iv was heplocked after she tolerated good po's and her patient controlled analgesia was converted to po percocet . she did have trouble with pain management and eventually was changed to oxycontin 10 mg. b.i.d. with flexeril prn muscle spasm . this regimen worked remarkably well and on postoperative day number two she was in her continuous passive motion machine from 0-30 degrees and was able to do some minimal crutch walking . the patient received a hinged knee brace with lock in full position to assist her and have her knee in full extension during ambulation . on postoperative day number two her temperature max was 100.3 and her vital signs were otherwise stable . she was neurovascularly intact . she was cleared by physical therapy for discharge the following morning . on the last day of hospitalization there was no change in her examination and the incision was clean , dry and intact with no evidence of erythema . she continued on her fragmin 5000 units subcutaneous q.day . condition

however the neurosurgeons felt that there was no surgical option , since even in the case of cerebellar swelling , there would be no improvement from decompensation . the patient was therefore treated conservatively with fluid restriction and blood pressure management . heparin was discontinued because of the risk of intercerebral hemorrhage . the aspiration pneumonia was treated with cefotaxime

{"id": 66, "label": 0, "text": "principal diagnosis : thoracoabdominal aneurysm . associated diagnosis : hypertension . principal procedure : 2/17/94 : resection and grafting of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm . history : the patient is a 74 year old female who was involved in a motor vehicle accident on 11/18/93 at which time her workup revealed a large thoracoabdominal aneurysm at the eifro medical center which was evaluated with a chest x-ray and abdominal ct scan . at that time the patient denied any symptoms of aneurysmal pain and did not suffer significant injury from her motor vehicle accident . she was subsequently referred to dr. riode zetllille for evaluation and workup of her aneurysm . the patient underwent a thoracic abdominal arteriogram on 12/31/93 via a right femoral approach and she was noted to have a large descending aorta with tortuosity but no aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta . the patient was discharged after the procedure was performed and subsequently admitted in this hospitalization for elective resection . since the patient 's last admission she gives no history of chest or back pain and continues to be quite active . physical examination : on physical examination she is a well developed female in no distress . her head and neck examination is within normal limits . her lungs were clear to auscultation . her lung and pericardic examination is regular rate and rhythm . her abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended . she has a pulsatile upper abdominal mass . extremities : are well perfused and she has a small left inguinal hernia . she has a well healed right groin scar and pulse examination reveals 2 plus pulses from the carotids through the posterior tibial arteries bilaterally . neurologically she is awake and alert , she has normal cranial nerve function and her motor examination is within normal limits . laboratory data on admission : is remarkable for normal serum electrolytes with creatinine 1.2 , hematocrit 31.9 and normal coagulation studies . ekg reveals a normal sinus rhythm , normal intervals with slight left ventricular hypertrophy repolarization abnormality . her chest x-ray is remarkable only for a tortuous aorta on the anterior projection . hospital course : the patient was admitted and underwent resection and grafting of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm which she tolerated well . there were no intraoperative complications . she was taken to the surgical intensive care unit postoperatively . the patient 's procedure was also remarkable for the fact that she underwent spinal cooling during this procedure . the patient remained intubated postoperatively . she had a stable first postoperative day without evidence of hemodynamic or cardiopulmonary deterioration . on postoperative day 1 she had a slight hematocrit drop to 27.2 which was expected with hydration in addition to intraoperative volume loss but otherwise had an unremarkable course . epidural anesthesia was used throughout her course for pain management and she was transferred to the surgical floor on postoperative day two . the patient developed an episode of atrial fibrillation with physical examination consistent with only mild cardiopulmonary congestion as manifested by bilateral scattered rales in the lung fields . serum electrolytes at the time revealed normal potassium levels and the patient was treated with p.r.n. verapamil and digoxin therapy for a heart rate varying between 80 and 110 . the patient 's oxygen saturations continued to maintain at levels greater than 95 percent and this was felt to be well controlled and she was placed on digoxin chronically and also diuresed for therapy . she was transferred to the surgical floor where on postoperative day three she began to complain of hypersensitivity in the left lower extremity and inability to move her toes . this was a new finding considering postoperatively she had full motor and sensory function of all four extremities . neurologic assessment at the time did in fact reveal profound paresis of the left lower extremity only with absent reflexes but hyperesthesia to light touch throughout the lower extremities . laboratory data obtained revealed no significant changes from her initial postoperative levels . neurological consultation was obtained . it was felt that the patient had been subjected significant cord ischemia and possibly this neurologic event also related to spinal or epidural catheter placement . the epidural catheter had been removed prior to their evaluation and no return of significant function was noted over the ensuing two days aside from flexion and extension of the toes but still the patient maintained profound proximal lower extremity weakness . mri obtained did not reveal evidence of a structural cause for cord or root dysfunction and further recommendation of abdominal ct scanning in addition to emgs and sseps to further evaluate and confirm the site of the lesion be performed . the patient continued to do well otherwise being slowly progressed in her diet and mobilized from bed to chair without difficulty . she was placed on a bowel regimen to alleviate signs and symptoms of constipation while the workup to determine the exact etiology of her left lower extremity paresis could be identified . continued supportive care was performed for the patient as again she manifested no other significant signs of hemodynamic or neurologic deterioration . her ultimate diagnosis was subsequently felt to be a segmental infarction of the anterior and lateral part of her t10 level spinal cord and there was no evidence of that recovery of her left lower extremity would be obtained . social service consultation for rehabilitation placement was performed . the patient understands the ramifications of her disability and continued neurologic assessment is to be made . the patient continued to make slight gains in motor movement of the left lower extremity as manifested by digital function and some knee jerk return and by postoperative day eight she was manifesting some dorsiflexion in addition to urodynamics being performed revealed good detrusion contraction , normal sensation and a coordinated sphincter which suggested no disability to the sympathetic control of her bowel and bladder . the patient complained of some urinary incontinence and urgency on the 10th postoperative day . she was placed on bactrim therapy for e. coli positive urine culture and emg performed revealed a lesion proximal in the central nervous system ( cns ) consistent with central lesions . additional neurological follow-up will be maintained as the patient continues to rehabilitate in the on modenyheatl rowbrook of medical center . it is at this point encouraging that she continues to slowly regain some motor function of the left lower extremity but the patient has been advised that this may in fact not return . condition on discharge : is satisfactory . discharge diagnosis : (1) status post thoracoabdominal aneurysm grafting and resection . complications : during this hospitalization include left lower extremity paresis as well as e. coli urinary tract infection . discharge medications : lopressor 25 mg po b.i.d. , dulcolax tablets 2 po q.a.m. , dulcolax suppository 1 po q.o.d. , digoxin .125 mg po q. day , bactrim ds b.i.d. ,

smear cultures . his electrocardiogram was within normal limits . his urine sediment was basically within normal limits . hospital course : mr. cliffestreukote was admitted on the night of the 20th , for obvious right lung pneumonia . the differential diagnosis included several organisms as outlined below . (1) pneumonia . he was admitted for a pneumonia unresponsive to antibiotics for five days . the pneumonia was found to be multilobar , and accompanied by significant hypoxia . he was started on broad spectrum coverage , including ceftriaxone , clindamycin , and ciprofloxacin . the ration off for the utilization of the ciprofloxacin , was that because of his allergy to erythromycin , an alternative regimen was needed to cover for legionella , which was probably the leading diagnosis at the time of admission , because of his hyponatremia accompanied by liver function abnormalities . however , he was isolated , and three afb smears were obtained , in order to rule out tuberculosis . in addition , sputum induction was performed for pneumocystis , which was negative . his urinary legionella antigen subsequently came back negative . however , this test is only 85-95% sensitive for legionella pneumophila , type i , which is the subtype that causes some 80% of legionnaires disease . however , the legionella antigen is neither sensitive , nor specific , for other legionella species that may be involved in legionella pneumonia . therefore , the ciprofloxacin was continued . in addition , his sputum cultures were all negative , as of the day of admission . after admission , with the initiation of antibiotic therapy , mr. cliffestreukote remained quite hypoxic . however , within one to two days after admission , he defervesced with a significant decrease in his cough during the week , post admission . because of persistent hypoxemia on room air , as well as nasal cannula , some concern was raised about the possibility of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , versus some other lesion that may predispose him for persistent hypoxemia , ( i.e. malignancy ) . therefore , an evaluation by the pulmonary team of the tonwe hospital , as well as a sputum cytology and chest ct scan , were all obtained . the chest ct scan revealed evidence for emphysematous changes of his lungs , as well as the previously noted right pneumonia , with several pseudo abscesses noted in infected bullae . his sputum cytology is pending at the time of discharge . the pulmonary team felt that the patient exhibited significant physical findings , laboratory values , and radiologic features , all consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . therefore , his persistent hypoxemia may be secondary to that underlying disease . despite being afebrile , with significant decrease in his cough , mr. cliffestreukote will be maintained , after discharge , on eleven more days of antibiotic therapy , to complete a full course . it should be noted , that clindamycin was discontinued , approximately three days after admission , because of the development of diarrhea . additionally , when switched to oral medication , mr. cliffestreukote was switched to augmentin 500 mg. p.o. t.i.d. , as well as continuing on his ciprofloxacin 150 mg. p.o. b.i.d. (2) hypertension . while in the hospital , mr. cliffestreukote was maintained on hydrochlorothiazide , and verapamil sr , and required no additional medication . (3) hyponatremia . while in the hospital , persistent type of natremia was noted on the patient 's profile 7 labs . it was felt that this was due largely to his pulmonary disease , and would resolve with the resolution of his intrapneumonic process . while in the hospital , there were no complications . discharge medications : augmentin 500 mg. p.o. t.i.d. for eleven more days , ciprofloxacin 750 mg. p.o. b.i.d. for eleven days , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. p.o. q. day , verapamil sr 240 mg. p.o. q. day , and atrovent meter dose inhaler two puffs four times a day . disposition : his condition on discharge was stable . he was discharged to home . he has a followup appointment with dr. naaan jesc , in the tonwe hospital pulmonary clinic on 2-18-95 , at 9:45 a.m. , as well as with his primary care physician , dr. rybam selcjescpint . his estimated disability is mild . we are still awaiting the results of his hiv testing . dictated by : nasa linkeweertsjescleask , m.d. co23 attending : rybam t. selcjescpint , m.d. on57 rp221/7499 batch : 9144 index no. wgrd2l3hee d : 10/27/94 t : 10/27/94 cc : 1. rybam t. selcjescpint , m.d. 2. nasa linkeweertsjescleask , m.d.
