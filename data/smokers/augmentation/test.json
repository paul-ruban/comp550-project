extremity with a similar finding for vibratory sense , but in an unreliable pattern . he occasionally had extinction in his left upper , greater than lower extremity , but this was fluctuating . mental state : he was awake , occasionally sleepy but easily aroused , oriented to self , oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital and the date . he was mildly perseverative and inattentive . coordination : his fine finger movements and rapid alternating movements were within normal limits . he was unable to stand without extensive assistance . laboratory data : sodium 141 , potassium 3.6 , bun 14 , creatinine 1.1 , hematocrit 37% , platelets 177 , white blood count 4.1 . chest x-ray showed degenerative joint disease , an ill defined left hemi-diaphragm without air space disease . on the lateral view , surgical clips in the abdomen . ekg showed normal sinus rhythm , no st or t wave changes . hospital course and treatment : mr. finger was admitted for what appeared to be a stroke syndrome involving his left middle cerebral artery territory . he underwent neurovascular doppler studies which showed no significant change in either common carotid or in the left common internal ophthalmic system . however , there were hemodynamic changes which raised the question of right siphon disease . he had normal cervical vertebral arteries . transcranial dopplers showed no abnormalities in the ophthalmic siphon systems , distal vertebrals , or proximal basilar artery . the proximal , middle , anterior and posterior cerebral arteries , however , could not be insinuated . over the course of the first hospital day , the patient 's exam deteriorated in a manner that appeared to be blood pressure dependent . he had been started on heparin from the time of his admission . a computerized tomography scan had showed multiple lacunes , right greater than left , and the deep gray and white matters suspicious for proximal middle cerebral artery stem occlusion or stenosis . mri / mra was performed with diffusion weighted images , showing subcortical white matter and basal ganglia infarcts , but preserved middle cerebral artery territory cortex . because of his blood pressure , dependence of his left sided extremities , the lower leg specifically , he was transferred to the intensive care unit where he underwent hypertensive therapy for several days . his systolic blood pressure goal was initially 170-190 , which he was able to achieve spontaneously for the most part . however , due to the absence of clear benefit at this level , and further deterioration in his left sided strength , this goal was increased and neo-synephrine was added to his regimen to achieve mean arterial pressures in the 110-120 range . this strategy and its incumbent risks , particularly in a patient on heparin , were discussed at length with both the patient and his family , who were very clear in wanting to proceed with all possible efforts to save the use of his left leg . while in the intensive care unit , his strength deteriorated from being able to hold his left leg off the bed up to several inches to loosing virtually all distal extremity strength , and having a 2-3/5 power in his proximal left leg groups . he also , as neo-synephrinewas tapered , developed mild sensory findings , in particular diminished large fiber sensibility in his left hand , although he at times , including near the end of his intensive care unit stay had a right gaze preference . in terms of exploring his visual space , he was able to look to the left , and it was not possible to elicit clear evidence for a field deficit . he was followed by speech and swallowing service , who assisted in the management of po intake which gradually improved , although he clearly had problems with manipulation of food in the left side of his mouth and would tend to accumulate a pouch of food in his left cheek . i should mention that his blood pressure therapy was at times limited by a severe headache , although he also had this off the pressor . he had several repeat imaging studies during his intensive care unit stay which showed further demarcation , but not extension of his prior infarct , both on computerized tomography scan and dwi images . additionally , he had a perfusion , diffusion mr study earlier on , which suggested the presence of viable penumbra , including the overlying cortex . he was transferred to the regular neurology floor once it became clear that he was not receiving any significant benefit from hypertensive therapy . at this time , his neurologic exam is notable for hemiplegia of his left arm , severe hemiparesis of his left leg , mild large fiber sensory loss in his left arm , and otherwise fairly intact mental status , cranial nerve function , and right sided motor and sensory function . we anticipate that he represents a good rehab potential . he will be discharged to rehab on a regimen of coumadin 5 mg po today then daily for an inr

media stinum were seen and no acute pulmonary disease was visualized . the patient also had a shoulder film done on 10/10/97 that showed a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus with proximal distraction . a lucency and irregularity of the glenoid , possibly representing a fracture , was also seen , and a ct scan was therefore obtained in order to evaluate this area . this ct scan , done also on 10/10/97 , again showed the severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus . two major fracture fragments were seen at the humeral head , articulating with the glenoid fossa . the fracture fragments retained their proper site of articulation with the glenoid fossa . innumerable smaller fracture fragments were interposed between the fracture fragment and the distal humeral shaft . the glenoid fossa was intact . no scapular fractures were present . ekg : normal sinus rhythm at 72 beats / minute , intraventricular conduction delay , q - waves seen in ii , iii , and avf with probable old inferior myocardial infarction . t - waves were also noted to be inverted in i and avl . ventricular bigeminy was also seen . hospital course and treatment : 1. orthopedics : the patient has a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus . he is status post a hemiarthroplasty on 10/17/97 . he received ancef preoperatively . physical therapy has been seeing the patient and putting him through passive external rotation to the neutral position of the left shoulder and forward flexion with physical therapy assistance . brittle bones were noted during the operation . a bone density scan would be recommended as an outpatient , in order to evaluate this . 2. neurological : the patient has right facial droop , right ptosis , stable and present for greater than one year . 3. cardiovascular : no chest pain , no shortness of breath , 1+ ankle edema . the patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction , given his fall at the airport and bigeminy seen on electrocardiogram that he developed during conscious sedation during reduction of the fracture . cardiology was consulted and aspirin and beta blocker added to his regimen , as well as chest wall nitroglycerin around the time of surgery , which was subsequently discontinued . an adenosine sestamibi was performed on 10/12/97 , which showed a negative electrocardiogram for ischemia and cardiac perfusion scans , with a moderate-sized , dense , fixed inferior defect indicative of scar . a small / moderate-sized , mild-intensity , reversible posterior lateral defect was also seen , indicative of mild / moderate ischemia . an echocardiogram was performed on columbus day which showed an ejection fraction of 50% , left atrial enlargement , thickening of the aortic wall consistent with atherosclerotic changes , left ventricle size , and systolic function within normal limits . cardiac monitor was placed on the patient , given the bigeminy , and he did rule out for myocardial infarction . cardiology recommended that in addition to the medications already stated above , his hematocrit be kept greater than 30 . after his procedure on 10/17/97 , elevated cpks were noted on 10/19/97 to 10/20/97 , and the first level was 744 , cpk # 2 635 , and cpk # 3 461 . mb fractionations of the cpks were all negative and were thought to be secondary to the patient 's beginning physical therapy on 10/19/97 , and all muscular in origin . 4. gastroenterology : gi was consulted on 10/15/97 for melena , decreased hematocrit prior to his humeral fixation surgery . upper endoscopy x 2 were done . the first was on 10/15/97 , which showed clotted blood in the esophagus . the stomach had evidence of prior surgery and old blood in the stomach . it was thought that the blood in the esophagus was secondary to a possible mallory-weiss tear . a second endoscopy was also performed several days later , in order to rule out a gastric ulcer , and also because the patient had had another episode of melena . a gastric ulcer was found and this was biopsied and pathology is pending at this time . this report needs to be followed up , and will be available at bri health in the pathology department some time within the next three to seven days . the patient also needs a repeat endoscopy and a gi follow-up appointment inapproximately two months . i have spoken with the patient in detail , and he will be getting in touch with his primary-care physician , dr. fordwoodall stick , in ranegei pkwy , verertliet , south carolina 62156 . the patient is to arrange follow up with a gi doctor in jotar boulevard , cunahtampfordama , south dakota 62848 through his primary-care physician . the patient was initially on cimetidine and carafate here at bri health , and then switched to prilosec 20 mg bid . 5. pulmonary : the patient 's admitting chest x-ray showed an elevated left hemidiaphragm consistent with atelectasis versus splinting on that side . incentive spirometry was started . albuterol and atrovent nebulizers were done . the patient received chest physical therapy bid . 6. endocrine : the patient needs still better diabetes control . he has been somewhat noncompliant with his diet ( eating pringle 's in the room ) . his nph was recently increased today ( 10/23/97 ) to 24 units in the a.m. and 14 units in the p.m. with czi sliding-scale coverage . 7. infectious disease : the patient urinalysis on 10/19/97 showed moderate occult blood , ph 5 , albumin 1+ , white blood cells present , 2-50 red blood cell , 10-20 white blood cells , few bacteria , and moderate bladder epithelial cells . floxin 200 mg po bid was begun . however , his urine culture from the same day remained negative , and this was discontinued two days later . a repeat urinalysis on 10/22/97 was negative . 8. renal : after the patient 's procedure , he was felt to be volume overloaded . he was given lasix 40 mg iv x 1 and also had nitro paste around the time of his surgery and beta blocker . the patient became slightly hypotensive on the night of 10/18/97 with systolic blood pressures in the 80s to 90s. his bun/ creatinine rose from 16/1.2 on 10/18/97 to 25/1.9 on 10/18/97 to 22/9.1 to today 's labs , which are 15/0.7 on 10/23/97 . 9. hematology : the patient transfused 2 units on 10/15/97 for a hematocrit of 27.6 . the patient transfused 2 units of 10/16/97 for a hematocrit of 30.03 . the patient transfused 1 unit on 10/18/97 for a hematocrit of 29.4 . the patient transfused 1 unit on 10/19/97 for a hematocrit of 27.9 . the patient transfused 2 units on 10/20/97 for a hematocrit of 28.2.10 . fen : repleting potassium , magnesium , phosphorus as needed . the patient was noted to be slightly hyponatremic over the past few days , with sodiums

right thoracoabdominal incision for bleeding . history of present illness : the patient is a 42 year old female with known metastatic colon carcinoma , limited to the liver , who is referred to dr. duhenile for placement of an internal pump for hepatic arterial chemotherapy . the patient initially presented in september of 1992 with bloody diarrhea . she subsequently underwent a right colectomy in september of 1992 for a duke 's c-ii moderately well differentiated adenocarcinoma of the hepatic flexure . she subsequently recent adjuvant 5-fu and levamisole therapy but developed a right hepatic metastasis in september of 1993 . in thanksgiving of 1993 , the patient underwent a partial right hepatectomy . postoperatively , she did well , however she was noted to have a rising carcinoembryonic antigen level in february of 1994 , of 5.7 , and a 42.1 in april of 1994 . a computerized tomography scan obtained in april of 1994 revealed hepatic metastases involving both lobes . after two additional cycles of 5-fu and leucovorin , the patient had marked progression of her hepatic metastases associated with tumor fevers . the computerized tomography scans continued to demonstrate disease confined to the liver . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital on 7-28-94 for placement of an infusaid pump versus an exploratory laparotomy for liver resection . prior to surgery , the patient was taken to vascular radiology where she underwent superior mesenteric artery and ciliac angiograms . these demonstrated 1. portal vein patent , 2. normal hepaticanatomy with normal right and left hepatic arteries , 3. an enlarged liver with necrotic regions consistent with known colon metastatic tumors . the patient was subsequently brought to the operating room where she underwent a hepatic right trisegmentectomy . the operative findings were notable for a softball sized tumor in the right lobe of the liver , as well as multiple smaller tumor nodules . the left lateral segment was grossly free of tumor . the intraoperative course was notable for acute hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the fifties . the patient received 21 liters of lactated ringers solution , 16 units of packed red blood cells , and 21 units of fresh frozen plasma , and 12 units of platelets . there were 5300 cc given via the cellsaver . the patient was returned to the surgical intensive care unit . however , over the ensuing hours , the patient continued to have ongoing blood loss with hypotension . the decision was made to return the patient to the operating room . the patient was then returned to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy for bleeding . the operative findings were notable for bleeding from the inferior vena cava . the patient was returned again to the surgical intensive care unit . however , again the patient continued to demonstrate ongoing hypotension and transfusion requirements . the patient required blood pressure support with pressors . due to output of approximately 950 cc on placement of a right chest tube , the decision was made to return tothe operating room for exploration for bleeding . the patient was therefore explored through a right thoracoabdominal incision . the abdomen was again notable for bleeding from the inferior vena cava , a notable coagulopathy , and therefore , the abdomen was packed and the patient was returned to the surgical intensive care unit . however , over the subsequent 8-10 hours , the patient continued to demonstrate declining blood pressure despite maximal support with pressor agents including phenylephrine , norepinephrine , epinephrine , and dopamine . the patient continued to require transfusions . the patient 's oxygenation became increasingly difficult , as the chest x-rays demonstrated marked pulmonary edema . the ventilator settings demonstrated elevating peak inspiratory pressures up to 75 millimeters . the urine output dropped dramatically , and the patient was treated with lasix and mannitol for an attempt at forced diuresis . as the patient 's hemodynamic parameters demonstrated a narrow pulse pressure and rapidly elevated pulmonary artery pressures , the decision was made to perform echocardiogram to rule out potential paracardial tamponade . the study was considered to be inadequate , and it was unable definitively rule out the presence of such tamponade . despite maximal support with pressor agents , mechanical ventilation , and ongoing transfusion with fresh frozen plasma and packed red blood cells , and a protamine for treatment of the coagulopathy , the patient continued to demonstrate declining blood pressure , and subsequently expired with a cessation of heart rate and blood pressure at 11:20 p.m. on 7-29-94 . at this point , the mechanical ventilator was turned off . condition on discharge : the patient expired . ri media , m.d. dictating for : fede a. duhenile , m.d. tr

has a history of a gunshot wound many years ago and has had multiple surgical procedures since then . most recently he was admitted to an outside hospital with a drug overdose in adult respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately found to have candidal pericarditis which eventually led to constrictive pericarditis . he had a pericardial window . he had a barium swallow and endoscopy and was said not to have gastric or pericardial ulcer . he had previous substernal gastric bypass because of an interruption of his esophagus at the time of his gunshot wound . he had been noted to have an ulcer and ultimately when he stabilized it was our feeling that he most likely had a gastric pericardial ulcer and he was transferred here for further management . we discussed the risks with his family . it was a very high risk in very poor condition and a cachectic malnourished edematous individuals who have very high venous pressures and shortness of breath . the family understood that this was a life saving procedure and only carried with it approximately 50% chance of success . special procedures and operations : esophagoscopy , bronchoscopy , pericardectomy , excision of gastric ulcer , repair of gastric ulcer and pectoralis major myocutaneous flap performed on december 4 , 1995 by dr. reg cranka and dr. win shufffyfe . in lieu of a standard discharge summary given this patient 's complicated hospital course and associated illnesses i feel it best to just provide a system summary concerning this patient 's current status . 1. neurologic and psychologic : the patient is on nortriptyline for depression . he is a paraplegic from t4 down . otherwise he is awake , alert and appropriate and can respond to questions and can move his upper extremities . the patient however spends most of his time at bedrest due to decubiti ulcer disease . 2. cardiac : the patient had constrictive pericarditis that was relieved by his surgical procedure . he had a cardiac catheterization on december 1 , 1995 that showed no complications , elevated right atrial pressure and moderate pulmonary hypertension . the cardiac output was five liters per minute with an index at 2.9 liters per minute per meter 2 which is normal . a full copy of the cardiac catheterization report is enclosed with his transfer materials . the patient also underwent cardiac ultrasound on december 11 , 1995 that showed abnormal right ventricle wall motion , trace mitral regurgitation , normal left ventricular size and function with an estimated ejection fraction of 64% . there is doppler evidence of tricuspid insufficiency and right atrial dilatation . there is trace pulmonary insufficiency . the right ventricle is dilated and diffusely hypokinetic and there is no evidence of constrictive physiology which was seen on december 6 , 1995 . a copy of this ultrasound is also found in his records . the patient is on no specific medications for his cardiac condition . 3. respiratory : the patient is status post thoracotomy and has staples and sutures on his chest . these may be removed when the incisions are noted to be well healed . the patient is approximately three weeks following his procedure and several of these stitches will be removed prior to discharge . the patient is on oxygen by face mask and his saturations have been remaining normal . his medications for his respiratory system are albuterol nebulizer 0.5 mg. 2.5 cc. q4hours . 3. gi : the patient has had gastric ulcer repair and also has a colostomy . the patient has a sinus tract that was studied with a fistulogram on december 25 , 1995 . this showed no communication with the intestines and was simply a sinus tract . there is no fistula seen . dr. asha vengloan of general surgery consulted on the patient and concluded the patient does not require any surgical treatment of this problem at the current time and the best treatment for this situation would be to increase the patient 's nutrition . the patient takes poorly his po. diet . however he is able to swallow and tolerate po's . he just claims to have no appetite and has very poor effort with feeding . the patient is able to tolerate po. medicines . 4. gu : the patient has an ulcer on his penis that has been treated with dressing changes . it has been noted to be improving . the patient has a foley catheter in and when the penile skin is very well healed his foley catheter may be removed . until this time he should be kept on three times daily wet to dry dressing changes . 5. skin : the patient has multiple decubiti over his body , in particular his perineum and buttocks have large decubiti . plastic surgery was consulted dr. ca shuff who saw the patient and decided that the patient is not a surgical candidate at this point . these wounds should be treated with three times daily wet to dry dressings . the patient 's activity should be limited to being up in a chair only for several minutes per day and sit on a special pad that the family has purchased . 6. infectious disease : the patient 's white count at the time of discharge is within normal limits . the patient remains on fluconazole . his other antibiotics were discontinued . his most recent cultures are negative . the chest x-ray shows no evidence of pneumonia . 7. pain . the patient has been very closely with the pain service here while admitted . he has

catheterization and coronary angiography ; 7/15/93 - cardiac ultrasound ; 7/21/93 - reopening of sternum ; 07/22/93 - mediastinal exploration . history of present illness : this extremely complex 75 year old woman was admitted from an outside hospital with fever . she was in her usual state of health until 6/15/93 when she began to experience intermittent confusion , diarrhea , and fevers up to 104 , associated with chills . there were transient mental status changes but no convulsions or loss of consciousness . she was also noted to have some diarrhea at this time . because of increasing mental status changes , the patient was admitted to o center in sondibrid ey on 6/20 , and she was found to have a gram-positive urinary tract infection , high fever , and was started on ciprofloxacin . blood cultures drawn on admission showed multiple organisms including clostridium perfringens , coagulase negative staph , and alpha hemolytic streptococcus . her antibiotics were appropriately changed . at the family 's request , the patient was transferred to heaonboburg linpack grant medical center for further evaluation . hospital course : further evaluation at heaonboburg linpack grant medical center , demonstrated that the patient had mitral valve endocarditis with mitral regurgitation that was initially managed medically . her antibiotics were appropriately adjusted because of the polymicrobial nature . cardiac echo showed that she had moderate mitral regurgitation , an enlarged left atrium , and good ventricular function . there was a suggestion of mitral valve vegetation . she was placed on intravenous antibiotics with gradual decrease in her temperature , although some low grade temperatures initially persisted . the patient had an extensive evaluation over the days that followed in order to find potential sources . she was evaluated by the gynecology service including the performance of a pelvic ultrasound and also by the gi service where she underwent a barium enema . there was no evidence of gi or pelvic disease which would account for the bacterial source . in addition , she was evaluated by the sileyer medical center and there was no evidence of active dental infection . she had a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging study performed and there was evidence of stroke . because of her complex picture , and because the source of her sepsis was not found , the initial plan was to treat with antibiotics and hopefully obtain a completely sterile surgical field for subsequent valve replacement , if indicated . her temperature became low grade and it was initially stable with her mitral regurgitation . towards the end of june , she had become afebrile and the initial plan was to complete a full course of antibiotics to obtain a sterile surgical field . a rash developed and antibiotics were appropriately changed and antibiotic levels were optimized . on 7/13 , she developed a sudden episode of pulmonary edema that resolved quickly and she was thought to have possible worsening of her mitral regurgitation . she was moved to the intensive care unit and underwent subsequent cardiac catheterization in preparation for possible surgery . her cardiac catheterization demonstrated minor coronary artery disease and severe mitral regurgitation with a suggestion of an annular abscess . after considerable discussion among the physicians involved in the patient 's care , it had become apparent that the mitral regurgitation had worsened . also , no source for sepsis had been found . because of worsening mitral regurgitation , and the findings of severe mitral regurgitation at cardiac catheterization , as well as elevated filling pressures , it was everyone 's opinion that the patient would not wait to complete a long course of antibiotics . accordingly , she was taken to the operating room on 7/21/93 . during her cardiac procedure , she sustained dissection of the ascending aorta . she , therefore , underwent graft replacement of her ascending aorta and mitral valve replacement . her valve was excised and any material that appeared infected was debrided . it was possible to clean the area thoroughly and it also became apparent that there was evidence of calcification in and around the annulus consistent with prior rheumatic fever . her valve was replaced with a st. jude medical mitral prosthesis and it was possible to place the valve securely . she weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with hemodynamics consistent with extreme vasodilation , and she required enormous doses of vasoconstrictors to maintain her blood pressure . she was bleeding after operation with her picture also consistent with coagulopathy , and the overall picture suggested the effects of systemic sepsis . in the early postoperative period , she had evidence of tamponade , possibly related to compression from her lungs , as the patient was noted to have elevated inspiratory pressures on the ventilator . the sternum was reopened with improvement in her hemodynamics and additional stability . she was returned to the operating room on 07/22 and underwent mediastinal exploration , removal of some mediastinal clot , and by now , hemostasis had improved . her sternum was left opened and the skin wound was left opened , using an elastic membrane to close the chest . with clotting factor replacement , bleeding gradually abated and was no longer a problem . she subsequently developed ongoing manifestations of sepsis with sustained vasodilation and developed anuric renal failure which required peritoneal dialysis . she remained on full support in the intensive care unit , on dialysis , with ongoing evidence of acidosis . despite full support on multiple , high dose inotropic and vasoconstrictor agents , her clinical status continued to deteriorate and it became apparent that her prognosis was extremely poor . after consultation with the family , it was decided to not resuscitate her and , with continued deterioration , she

{"id": 46, "label": "non-smoker", "text": "chief complaint : cean leach is a 38 year old male who is admitted in transfer from the morehegron valley hospital in ville , virginia for further evaluation and management of accelerating chest pains syndrome . mr. leach has a long and complex history of coronary artery disease . he was without known cardiovascular illness until he suffered an acute anterior myocardial infarction in august of l988 . he was treated at that time with tpa . a subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% lesion in his proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and minor disease elsewhere in his coronary distribution . his ejection fraction was in the mid-50's. because of angina following that catheterization , he ultimately underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronary artery . he did well until he developed recurrent angina in march of l991 at which time repeat catheterization demonstrated restenosis of his left anterior descending and he underwent a second ptca with good results . he again did well until approximately late l992 . since that time , he has had multiple admissions to george'sdgot medical center with recurrent chest pain . he has ruled in for small r q wave myocardial infarctions on many but not all of these occasions . he has had a progressive decline in his left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by non-invasive means with an echo ejection fraction in the low 40's and radionuclide ejection fraction estimated in august of l994 at 31% . he was admitted to george'sdgot medical center with a typical episode of this discomfort in october of l994 . he was transferred at that time to the ph university of medical center . that was his first ph university of medical center admission . because of mr. leach 's history and the fact that multiple cardiac catheterizations prior to that transfer had failed to demonstrate fixed epicardial coronary disease , it was decided that he should undergo provocative testing to evaluate whether or not he had coronary artery spasm and / or impaired coronary flow reserve . his angiograms from morehegron valley hospital from his four prior catheterizations were reviewed and the patient was gradually tapered off all of his vasoactive medications . he was taken to the catheter laboratory on october 13 , 1994 . there he had a right heart catheterization with unremarkable intercardiac pressures . repeat coronary angiography once again failed to demonstrate any significant obstructive lesions in either his dominant right coronary artery or his left coronary system . he then underwent a doppler coronary flow study which demonstrated impaired coronary flow reserve . specifically , his coronary flow maximally increased by a factor of 2-2.5 whereas a normal response is considered to a 3-4 fold increasing in coronary flow to maximal stimulus . following the coronary flow studies , he was given greater doses of intracoronary ergonovine to assess his susceptibility to coronary artery spasm . he had a normal response to ergonovine that is he had diffuse narrowing of his coronary arteries without induction of focal spasm . however , he did develop typical anginal discomfort which was easily reversed with intracoronary nitroglycerin . it was felt that the time that this study was most consistent with a syndrome of impaired coronary flow reserve or microvascular angina . he was treated with increasing doses of two calcium channel blockers and gradually ambulated in the hall without discomfort and was discharged to home . following that admission in october he had a symptom free interval which lasted a couple of months . starting in the october of l994 , he once again started having recurrences of his typical anginal discomfort . this occurred at rest and with exercise . he had multiple admissions to the morehegron valley hospital once again ruling in for a small r q wave myocardial infarctions on a number of these occasions . his medications were adjusted many times without adequate interruption of the pattern of increasingly frequent and increasingly severe episodes of pain . his most recent admission to the morehegron valley hospital is on april 5 , of 1994 . he had a prolonged episode of typical anginal pain and rule in for a small q wave myocardial infarction . because of the refractory nature of his chest pain and the failure of multiple drug combinations to control his symptoms , he was transferred to ph university of medical center on 4-9-94 . his medications that had been used individually or in combination include beta blockers and lodapine cardiazem , nifidepine and coumadin , aspirin , cyclopadine and seratonin antagonists . there is no history of drug abuse or smoking . of note , his brother had a myocardial infarction in his late 20's . there is no other family history of premature coronary disease or history of stroke or deep venous thrombosis suggestive of hypercoaguable state . of note , his prior work-up has also included screening test for hypercoaguability with normal levels of protein s and c and an unrevealing right ventricular under myocardial biopsy . his medications on admission included isordil , lovastatin , aspirin , heparin and lodapine , cardizem and lasix . physical examination : he looked generally well . his blood pressure l60/90 . his heart rate was 88 . his jugular venous pressure was normal . his chest was clear and his carotids were brisk and his cardiac examination revealed a soft systolic flow murmur . his abdomen was obese with no palpable organomegaly . his femoral pulses were l+ and equal without bruits . he had trace peripheral edema and excellent peripheral pulses . his initial laboratory values included a sodium of l38 . potassium of 3.2 . normal chloride and co2 . his bun was 12 and his creatinine was 1.1 . glucose was l55 although subsequent determinations were normal . his fasting cholesterol was 174 with an hdl of 35 and an ldh of 97 . his liver function tests were normal with the exception of his ldh which was mildly elevated to 222 . his hematocrit was approximately 39 with an unremarkable differential and normal platelet count . his sedimentation rate was 32 and was 40 on repeat testing . hospital course : the primary concern upon mr. leach 's transfer was that despite the fact that he had multiple previous catheterizations over the prior two years that he may have redeveloped obstructive coronary artery disease . it was ; therefore , felt appropriate to start his repeat work-up by repeating his cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography . to that end , he was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on 4-10-94 , there he underwent right and left heart catheterization , coronary angiography and left ventriculography . the right heart catheter which was done using a swanz ganz catheter advanced to 8 french sheath and right femoral vein revealed a mean right atrial pressure 3 mm of mercury and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 mm of mercury . the left ventricular pressure was l05/12 . coronary angiography revealed a picture which was essentially unchanged from october of l994 . that is there was no obstructive large vessel or coronary artery disease although there were some diffuse luminal irregularities . left ventriculography revealed a large area of antero lateral and apical hypokinesis to akinesis with an estimated ejection fraction of 35% . impression at the time of his catheterization was that the precise etiology of his chest pain remained rather enigmatic . he was ; therefore , seen in consultation by dr. lato tikfreierm of the hematology service to evaluate him further for a possible hypocoagulable condition versus primary and secondary platelet abnormality which could explain his recurrent coronary events . after an extensive evaluation including in vitro testing and flow cytometry of mr. leach 's platelets , it was ultimately determined that he did in fact have a primary platelet defect . specifically , his platelets were not affected by aspirin and showed spontaneous hyperaggragability . this was utilized in making some changes in mr. leach 's regiment . specifically his aspirin was discontinued and he was put back on ticlopidine at a higher than ordinary dose at 500 mg. b.i.d. repeat in vitro testing of mr. leach 's platelets suggested that although they remained refractory to aspirin , they did demonstrate reduced hyperaggragability spontaneously which was felt to be possible reflective of the ticlopidine effect . while in the hospital , mr. leach continued to nearly daily episodes of chest pain . these were generally spontaneous in nature and lasted anywhere from several minutes to nearly an hour duration . there were typically improved but not completely eradicated with sublingual nitroglycerin and generally required i.v. narcotics for complete pain relief . because of the ongoing nature of his pain . multiple changes and additions were made to his drug regimen . he was tried on theophylline and imipramine without real change in his chest pain syndrome . he was tried on a variety of different combinations of calcium channel blockers including amlodipine and diltiazem and lodipine and verapamil . amlodipine and bepridil all without marked change in his clinical syndrome . the rest of his hypercoagulable work-up revealed that he had nearly normal levels of clotting factors , specifically , his antithrombin 3 of level was lll with a reference range of 80-120 . protein c was 85 with a reference range of 70-140 . protein s was l14 with a reference range of 70-140 . plasminogen was slightly high at l51 with upper limit of normal being l30 . factor 8 was likewise slightly high at 249 with a reference range of 50-200 . thrombin time and repalase time were normal . it was felt that these results were non-specific and may represent just an acute phase reactants . his anti-cardio lipen antibodies both igm and igg were within normal range . his apc resistance was normal . he was seen in consultation by both rheumatology and endocrinology to evaluate the possibility of primary connective tissue disease an / or possible a theochromocytoma . rheumatology felt that there was no good evidence of a primary vasculitic process as the source of his presumed small vessell coronary disease and no further rheumatologic work-up was undertaken . he had multiple 24 hour urine tests performed to evaluate the question of theochromocytoma , these demonstrated mild elevations of some urinary catacholomines , but it was felt that this could well represent a reaction to the complex medical regimen that he was having as well as the recurrent episodes of pain themselves . it was not felt that he had good evidence of theochromocytoma . his compliment levels were normal and he had no evidence of hepatitis , b serologies which also measured to see if there was some chronic inflammatory process . because of the persistent nature of his pain and the inability to control it adequately on constantly changing a quite complex medical regimen , it was suggested that a sympathetic blockade be performed as a method of controlling his chest pain syndrome . to evaluate the efficacy of this prior to commiting him to a permanent blockade procedure , a temporary sympathetic blockade was performed using a local anesthetic and stellate ganglion injection . prior to performing that an exercise tolerance test was performed on may 13 . that study demonstrated that the patient was able to exercise for ten minutes of a standard protocol and stopped because of fatigue ; although he had no significant st changes with exercise , he did experience his typical anginal chest discomfort which was ultimately relieved of the combination of sublingual nitroglycerin and i.v. morphine sulfate . on the basis of that test , he underwent stellate block the following day . that was performed in the pain clinic using l% lidocaine to the skin and l0 cc of bupivacaine under fluoroscopic guidance at the level of t1 . this produced a good sympathetic block with evidence of a rise in temperature in the left arm and ptosis and myosis of the left eye . he was then taken directly from the pain clinic to the exercise laboratory and repeat exercise testing was done . he once again exercised for ten minutes achieved the same rate pressure product and had no chest discomfort . this encouraged his care takers to pursue a more permanent sympathetic blockade . after extended discussions with pain service , mr. leach was brought back down to the pain clinic on october 27 . there a catheter was placed at the level of t1 under fluroscopic guidance . once again narcaine was injected to induce a sympathetic block . the catheter was left in place for approximately 24 hours with recurrent injections maintained the sympathetic block and during that time he had no recurrent angina . after extensive discussions with the patient , the pain service and thoracic surgery , it was felt appropriate to proceed with a surgical sympathectomy to relieve him of his intractable chest pain syndrome . therefore , on october 27 , the patient underwent left thorascopic thoracic sympathectomy by dr. aalv sctroi . he tolerated that procedure well and had no recurrent anginal pain throughout the rest of his hospitalization . he had incisional pain which was well-controlled with a combination of percocet and morphine sulfate and progressively ambulated and was discharged to home in good condition free of recurrent angina on may 27 , 1995 . discharge medications : ticlopodine 500 mg. p.o.b.i.d.

{"id": 48, "label": "non-smoker", "text": "history of present illness : mr. kacholera junk was a 34 year old gentleman with no significant past medical history except for a history of of intravenous drug abuse . he was status post a rehabilitation hospitalization at the raya ma den erinmarg hospital with a recent recrudescence of his drug abuse . he was admitted to the sephsandpot center on the morning of 4/9 and was subsequently transferred to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital for further care . the patient was apparently well until one day prior to admission . his family reports that he had worked that day . he relates using large doses of cocaine and heroin early in the morning on the day of admission . at 3:00 a.m. on the day of admission he was found by the emergency medical technicians \" crawling on all fours \" , confused , and combative outside his home . he gave an equivocal history of fevers and chills on the days prior to admission . bystanders report that he was assaulted about 20 minutes earlier and the nature of the assault was not known . he was taken to the sephsandpot center where he was hypotensive with a blood pressure of 105/85 , tachycardic with a heart rate to 186 , aneuric , hyperthermic , with a temperature to 105 degrees f , and progressively more confused . his chest x-ray was clear . he was treated with dopamine for hypertension and inderal for tachycardia . he received two amps of narcan . he received one gram of ceftriaxone intravenously after blood cultures were drawn . his initial arterial blood gas at the sephsandpot center revealed a p02 of 76 , pc02 14 , and a ph of 7.44 on room air . he was then transferred via med flight to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital . he denied any history of recent travel . toxicology screen at sephsandpot center revealed cocaine and quinine . shortly after his arrival to that hospital he had been intubated for a respiratory rate of 60 . he required medical paralysis for this . he was reported to have a seizure , although the nature of this was unclear , and received valium for this . past medical history : none . past surgical history : he is status post recent left knee surgery , status post left carpal tunnel release . medications on admission : his meds on transfer to fih were levophed , dopamine , and ceftriaxone . family history : the patient is divorced with no children . his mother and father are alive and well . social history : the patient works as a welder . he has a history of intravenous drug abuse , no alcohol abuse or tobacco abuse . physical examination : revealed an obtunded white muscular man who was intubated and sedated . the vital signs showed a blood pressure of 69 , pulse 80 , respirations 14 , and temperature 99.8 . there is a contusion over the right eye but no laceration , abrasion of her left shoulder , no flank discoloration , blanching papules over the knees bilaterally without central necrosis . he had multiple tattoos . lymphatic-he had shotty cervical adenopathy . the head , eyes , ears , nose , throat exam was normocephalic , with trauma as described , pupils were 2 mm bilaterally which were minimally reactive , fundi was not seen , conjunctivae without erythema , sclerae anicteric , positive corneal reflexes noted . ears-the tympanic membranes were clear with no hemorrhage at the time of admission . nose-no sinus discharge , no hemorrhage . the oropharynx was intubated . lungs-clear with good air movement bilaterally . he had scattered wheezes following a 3 liter bolus for hypotension . no effusion or rub was heard . the cardiac exam showed point of maximal impulse was not displaced , regular rate and rhythm with normal s1 , s2 , no s3 or s4 , a grade ii / vi systolic murmur was heard at the left upper sternal border without radiation , likely representing a flow murmur . no peripheral edema was noted . the jugular venous pressure was not assessed secondary to cervical collar being in place . the carotid pulses were brisk bilaterally . the vascular exam showed normal pulses bilaterally without bruits . the abdomen was soft , bowel sounds of normal character , and there was mild percussion tenderness and tenderness to modest palpation in all four quadrants . it was unclear whether this was due to superficial tenderness or abdominal tenderness . he had marked voluntary guarding without rigidity and no masses were felt . the genitourinary exam showed normal penis with normal testicles which were nontender . there was no urethritis , no balinitis , normal prostate , nontender . there was tan guaiac positive stool with no masses . the musculoskeletal exam showed well developed , symmetrical muscular development with no fasciculations , no joint erythema , no effusions . neuro exam-the mental status exam was variable , intermittently responsive , unable to follow commands . he nods appropriately and was able to confirm known history . the cranial nerves ii-xii grossly intact , bilaterally symmetric . the motor exam-moves all four extremities easily and on command . the sensory exam revealed no focal deficits to limited exam . reflexes were trace in the upper extremities and absent in the knees with downgoing toes bilaterally . laboratory data : on admission the sodium was 144 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 114 , bicarbonate 12.3 , bun 30 , creatinine 4.0 , glucose 89 . the sgot was 994 , ldh 1,888 , alkaline phosphatase 92 , total bilirubin 2.9 and direct bilirubin 11.2 . lactate was 6.3 , acetone negative , ammonia 26 , uric acids 26.9 , albumin 4.0 , globulin 3.0 , amylase 259 , lipase 34 , magnesium 3.5 , phosphorus 1.9 , calcium 9.4. the white blood count was 19.7 with 89% polys , 7% bands , 4% lymphs , with toxic granulations . hematocrit was 45.2 with a platelet count of 132,000 , falling rapidly to 24,000 . the mcv is 88 . the prothrombin time is 27.7 , partial thromboplastin time is greater than 100 . the urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.15 , ph 5.0 , and 4+ albumin , positive occult blood , with 0-5 granular casts and 5-10 rbcs and 3-5 wbcs . the ck was 17,890 with 0.6% mb . the urine sodium was 147 . the serum toxicology was positive for cocaine on admission to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital as well as the sephsandpot center . the electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 85 with a prolonged qt at 0.572 . an i-head ct revealed left sphenoid and left maxillary sinusitis with mild cerebral edema and no focal hemorrhages . the abdominal ct revealed mesenteric adenopathy , normal bowels , hepatosplenomegaly , and ? fatty liver . chest x-ray revealed early interstitial edema . hospital course : the patient was admitted with the diagnosis of cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , shock , hepatic failure , pancreatitis , and thrombocytopenia in the setting of cocaine intoxication . he was accepted at the vo yd burgsygu hospital center intensive care unit and his hospital course will be reviewed by problems . 1-rhabdomyolysis . the patient had massive cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis . this resulted in tremendous third spacing of fluid and persistent intervascular hypovolemia . the patient 's creatinine ______________ kinase peaked at 56,160 with negative mb percentages . the aldolase was positive at 142 . this was further complicated by hypocalcemia which resulted in mild electrocardiographic abnormalities . the patient 's urine was alkalinized with intravenous bicarbonate to maximize the myoglobin secretion . the patient 's urine output was further augmented by adding dopamine . nevertheless , the patient 's renal failure continued to progress . over the course of the hospitalization his ck fell in the serum . much of his diffuse pain was felt to be due to this massive rhabdomyolysis . 2-renal failure . the creatinine was 4.4 on admission and peaked at 10.5 on the 15th . the urinalysis revealed 4+ albumin with marked occult blood . peritoneal dialysis was instituted on 4/11 after a tenckhoff catheter was placed by drs. freierm , le , and round . subsequently his creatinine rose for three days and then stabilized at 10 . he continued to make minimal urine throughout the hospitalization . 3-disseminated intravascular coagulation . on admission the patient 's prothrombin time was 27.7 with a partial thromboplastin time of greater than 100 and a d-dimer positive at 8 with a fibrinogen of 69 . he went on to develop profound thrombocytopenia complicated by hemorrhage . the patient was supported with abundant use of fresh frozen plasma , cryoprecipitate , platelets , and packed red blood cells . his dic was further complicated by hepatic failure which resulted in poor endogenous production of clotting factors and he remained fresh frozen plasma dependent . 4-septic shock . the patient remained pressor dependent throughout his hospitalization . he was maintained variously on levophed , dobutamine , dopamine , and ultimately epinephrine for blood pressure support . hemodynamic monitoring revealed low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac output . he had multiple sources of infection including his sinuses , lungs , and multiple lines . this will be discussed below . further he had massive muscle necrosis and hepatic failure . an echocardiogram on 4/12 revealed a dilated left ventricle which was diffusely mildly hypokinetic with no vegetations . his ejection fraction was 55% . on 4/16 the pulmonary artery catheter was placed which revealed a wedge pressure of 8 , cardiac index of 4.5 , and an svr of 5.8 . 5-hepatic failure . his sgpt on admission was 2,520 with a peak at 7,680 on hospital day two . he had complete loss of synthetic and conjugation function of the liver with rising bilirubin and falling albumin with dependence on transfusion for support of his prothrombin time . he was seen in consultation by the gi service and the liver transplantation service . given his multiple other medical problems , the direness of his situation , and his ongoing substance abuse at the time of admission he was deemed not to be a candidate for a liver transplantation . 6-cocaine intoxication . serum cocaine was positive 6-12 hours ingestion at the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital . further , at ceanotsit ortgold center his serum toxicology screens were positive . this is thought to be the insighting cause of his massive rhabdomyolysis and hepatic failure . 7-pneumonia . the patient developed two pneumonias with two separate organisms . the first was acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus , treated with ciprofloxacin and gentamicin . he subsequently developed a staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was treated with vancomycin , dosed to levels appropriate for his renal failure . he was seen in consultation by the infectious disease service who advised us on antibiotic choices daily . 8-pancreatitis . the amylase on admission was 279 with a lipase of 161 . although not fully this may have contributed to his hypocalcemia and volume requirements . 9-catheter tip infections . the patient grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus from the femoral lines which were placed during his profound hypertension . these were treated with vancomycin . 10-anemia . the patient 's hematocrit was 33% on admission and fell to 28 requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells over the course of his hospitalization . 11-coma . the patient , although initially minimally responsive , went on to develop a deep comatose state . a ct scan on admission revealed no evidence of hemorrhage though he did have sphenoid sinusitis . the lumbar puncture and sinus exploration were unable to be performed given the patient 's persistent coagulopathy . the patient was treated empirically with nafcillin and ceftriaxone for meningitis and sinusitis . further complicating this was his profound liver failure with rising ammonias and hepatic encephalopathy . despite maximal supports the patient continued to be hypotensive . mid-way through his hospital course he developed trilobar pneumonia and this was probably complicated further by adult respiratory distress syndrome and the multi-organ system failure syndrome . the patient remained mechanically ventilated throughout his hospitalization . nevertheless , he developed refractory hypoxemia , hypotension , and ultimately the patient died despite total life support . discharge diagnosis : cocaine intoxication , rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , septic shock , hepatic failure , pneumonia , pancreatitis , catheter tip infection , anemia , coma . principal procedure : peritoneal dialysis catheter placement , peritoneal dialysis , arterial catheterization , venous catheterization , continuous mechanical ventilation , and parenteral nutrition . complications during admission : neck hematoma secondary to

{"id": 53, "label": "non-smoker", "text": "history of present illness : this is a 70-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease , on hemodialysis and peritoneal hemodialysis for ten years , transferred from ton university hospital for further evaluation of change in mental status . she was admitted to aper hospital for change in mental status on 7/19/2002 . initial work up was unrevealing . she was discharged to rehabilitation and developed disorientation , confusion , incoordination , and apparent paranoia . she was diagnosis with a urinary tract infection and perineal inflammation and was transferred to the hospital and treated with iv tequin for urinary tract infection . throughout her admission , she experienced occasional low-grade temperatures to 99 fahrenheit with persistent leukocytosis . there was a reported examination of her peritoneal fluid when fluid was being drawn for culture . a catheter was subsequently placed for treatment of __________ for three days of ceftazidime . herperitoneal fluid cultures have all been negative and showed only 3 polys . there was a question of 3 x 4 collection around the peritoneal catheter that was investigated with an i+ abdominal ct scan that was not conclusive . she was switched , however , to hemodialysis from peritoneal dialysis . alumbar puncture of on 07/31/2002 was significant for an opening pressure reported as 12 cm of water . only 1 white blood cell was detected , and the fluid was culture and gram stain negative . work up also included a negative ppd , clostridium difficile toxin , blood cultures , and head ct scan . an electroencephalogram showed nonspecific , left greater than right slowing , without epileptiform spikes . a speech and swallow evaluation initially deemed her an aspiration risk , and she was taken of po 's . her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was found to be 48 . lupus anticoagulant was weakly positive , as was a d-dimer . past medical history : notable for end-stage renal disease secondary to chronic urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis with vesicoureteral reflux . peritoneal dialysis x ten years , resulting from that . and status post right nephrectomy , status post cholecystectomy , ____________thyroidectomy . medications on transfer to the bri health from aper hospital : aspirin 81 mg qd , epogen 10,000 units tiw , folate 4 mg qd ,

codeine , tetracycline , nitrofurantoin . social history : not available at the time . at baseline by report the patient was self-sufficient and aided in the care of her husband . she denies the use of tobacco or ethanol . she was raised in the delaware and spent many years on an organic farm . family history : noncontributory . physical examination : the patient was afebrile at 98.7 , blood pressure 128/64 , heart rate 96 , respiratory rate 22 , 02 s 96% on room air . in general , she was well appearing in no apparent distress . the pupils were equal and reactive to light and accommodation . the oropharynx was moist . the jugular venous pressure was 6 cm . there was no palpable lymphadenopathy . the chest was clear bilaterally . the heart had a regular rate and rhythm , normal s1 and s2 , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops . the abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with good bowel sounds . there was no hepatosplenomegaly . there was no erythema around the catheter site . there was only mild suprapubic fullness that was not tender . there was no guarding or rebound . there was no peripheral edema . on neurologic examination , the patient followed only simple commands . she moved all extremities . she had decreased strength bilaterally . she missed her nose with both hands when asked to touch her nose . there was a questionable positive babinski on the right side . the toes were downgoing on the left . she answered appropriately to yes-no questions , but _____________ she appeared to understand questions , but then could not come up with the answers , or where she was , and she could not give her name , but did respond when her name was used . laboratory data : on admission included a sodium of 146 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 101 , co2 31.6 , bun 8 , creatinine 4.3 , glucose 94 , calcium 10.5 , magnesium 1.5 , phosphorus 2.5 . her liver function tests were all within normal limits . her coagulation factors showed a pt of 13.2 , inr 1.2 , ptt 23.2 . her white blood cell count was elevated at 17.6 . the hematocrit was 43.3 , platelets 425,000 . the differential was 85% polymorphonuclearleukocytes . abdominal ct scan from the outside hospital showed no abscess and left renal atrophy with multiple cysts . the electroencephalogram showed left greater than right frontotemporal slowing throughout the tracing . head ct scan on 07/30/2002 showed prominent ventricles , cortical atrophy , and suggested infarct in the left thalamus , left insular cortex , and decreased attenuation in the right frontal lobe . as noted , laboratory data at the outside hospital included a negative clostridium difficile , a weakly positive d-dimer , a weakly positive lupus anticoagulant , and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 48 . hospital course : the patient 's presentation was a very confusing and complicated one with differential diagnosis including a neurodegenerative process such as creutzfeldt-jakob disease , a dementia such as alzheimer 's of a more rapidly progressing nature , and other infectious etiologies such as urinary tract infection or another fever source . work up included from a neurologic perspective brain mri , brain eeg , lumbar puncture . in concert with the neurology service , who followed the patient with us , we ordered an eeg and mri with susceptibilities and dwi . an lumbar puncture was performed , in which we measured the opening pressure as unremarkable at 14.5 cm . in addition , per neurology recommendations , we sent cerebrospinal fluid for gram stain , bacterial culture , fungal cultures , acid-fast bacilli , __________ antigen , 14-3-3 protein for creutzfeldt-jakob disease , cytology , and , in addition , ordered eegs , mris , antithyroglobulin antibody , antithyroid peroxidase antibody , tsh , ammonia , methyl malonic acid , and , in addition , considered neoplastic tests from the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid including anti-ma , anti-ta , anti-cv2 , anti-hu , anti-yo antibodies . in addition , from a renal perspective , the patient was placed on a tuesday , thursday , saturday dialysis schedule . for her hypertension , shewas given lisinopril . for her fen , the patient was able to take po 's and , per speech and swallow consult , was permitted to take po 's with one to one supervision . for prophylaxis , the patient was on subcutaneous heparin and nexium . from an infectious disease perspective , the patient remained afebrile and , despite a transient bump in her white blood cell count over the weekend of 08/10 through 08/12/2002 , has had a white blood cell count come back to normal range of 12.0 . no obvious source of infection was found , with negative cultures from blood , urine , sputum , the peritoneal fluid , and cerebrospinal fluid . excellent suggestions from dr. pa of the renal service included repeating anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant , given the patient 's weakly positive lupus anticoagulant in the past and the fact that this could be associated with severe and rapid cognitive decline that was observed in this patient . however , these antibodies were both within normal limits . the patient 's mental status gradually began to improve during the course ofthe weekend from 08/10 through 08/12 and was markedly improved on 08/13/2002 , compared with the day of admission . however , the patient remains not oriented to time or to place , although she is now able to answer questions and actually carry on simple conversations appropriately . the nature of her cognitive decline and change in mental status is still unclear , with most typical and less typical causes of reversible change in mental status having been ruled out and no obvious sources of infection from blood , csf , sputum , urine , or peritoneal fluid . on the abdominal ct scan , there was a question of an ovarian cystic mass that raised the possibility of ovarian cancer . ca-125 levels were within normal limits . we entertained the possibility of doing a pelvic ultrasound to further characterize this lesion . we will discuss the case further with the neurology service , who will evaluate the case more carefully tomorrow with their attending . pending no further suggestions on their part , we have completed the metabolic work up for reversible causes of dementia and will likely discharge the patient to return to the termarimed pending no further suggestions from neurology or other consultants . lenni e. hodgkin , m.d. , ph.d dictating for : electronically signed lenni e. hodgkin , m.d. , ph.d 08/20/2002 07:46

: the patient was found to be in congestive heart failure and thought likely secondary to diastolic dysfunction secondary to hypertension . the patient was also found to have pulmonary hypertension . she ruled out for myocardial infarction with 3 negative enzymes . on admission , she was diuresed with lasix and was negative 1-2 liters per day for several days . the diuresis was backed off when her bicarbonate increased from 36 to 39 . she was restarted on 20 mg p.o. q day prior to discharge . her lipids were checked with a total cholesterol of 110 , triglycerides 59 , hdl32 , ldl 64 . the

outpatient as these were not done in the hospital . the pulmonary team saw the patient and only recommended the above testing . she needs home oxygen and is currently at 2 liters nasal cannula oxygen . 3. infectious disease : evidence for cellulitis on her legs , likely due to distention from edema and poor perfusion . she was originally started on cefazolin which was then changed to keflex with good improvement . she will need to continue for at least 10 more days or as clinically indicated by the course of her cellulitis . 4. hematology : d-dimer in the emergency room was greater than 1000 and a right common femoral clot was seen . this clot was small and it was questionable as to whether it was old or new . she was started on anticoagulation given the positive d-dimer . chest ct was nondiagnostic but did not show pulmonary embolus . it was a poor study . heparin was maintained during her hospital course and then lovenox was started . her dose was increased to 7.5 mg q day the day prior to discharge . she will be discharged on this dose in addition to 1 day of lovenox . discharge inr 1.8 . goal inr is 2.0-3.0 . 5. fluids / electrolytes / nutrition : low salt diet . low cholesterol , low fat diet . disposition on discharge : to rehabilitation . discharge instructions : house diet . no added salt . low saturated fat . low cholesterol . activity : as tolerated .

20 mg. d . amiodarone 200 mg. y . coumadin as adjusted by prothrombin times . digoxin 0.125 mg. y . multivitamin one tablet daily and albuterol nebulizers qid . history of present illness : the patient is a 69 year old woman from maine without prior history of overt cardiac disease . she does have a history of peripheral edema on dyazide . she has been a smoker and presented on the day of admission with dizziness . she was in her usual state of health until two to three days prior to admission when she noted intermittent dizziness and felt weak . she denied chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea or vomiting . on the morning of admission to the haold memorial hospital she went out to feed some birds and then felt weak , came back , was dizzy and was somewhat diaphoretic . her sister with whom she lives insisted that she seek medical care and she was brought to the haold memorial hospital emergency room and was found to have a pulse of 61 and blood pressure of 91/45 . the electrocardiogram done there showed evidence of an inferior wall infarction with st segment elevations in leads 2 , 3 and avf and st depressions in leads v1 through v4 and avl . right sided leads did not provide evidence of a right ventricular infarction . she was given streptokinase , aspirin , dopamine for hypotension and atropine with external zoll pacemaker after bradycardia into the 30 's developed . the blood sugar was elevated at 208 . the bun was 24 and creatinine 1.7 . the uric acid 11.2 and initial ck was 35 . when she developed wide complex tachycardia she was given a lidocaine bolus and brought to the fih by helicopter . in the emergency room she appeared hemodynamically stable initially and the dopamine was weaned off . the electrocardiogram taken here showed the st segment elevations had diminished considerably but there were continued reciprocal changes in the anterior leads . she had a few beats of wide complex tachycardia . her only medication was dyazide . physical examination : she was a pleasant rather vague obese woman in no acute distress . the pulse was 68 to 80 and the blood pressure 95/52 . the respirations 18 and she was afebrile . the jugular veins were not distended . the carotids were full . there were no bruits . the chest was clear with distant breath sounds . the cardiac rhythm was regular with frequent premature beats and no murmur . there were no rubs . the abdomen was obese without palpable organs or masses . there was no peripheral edema . there were good dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally . there was decreased vibratory sense on neurological examination but there was no asterixis . her electrolytes were normal with a bun of 24 and creatinine 1.9 . the cholesterol was 171 . triglycerides 103 . by this time her ck was 600 . her hematocrit was 37.1 . hemoglobin 12.8 and white blood count 7800 . the pt was 19.3 and ptt 34.8 . review of the electrocardiograms from haold memorial hospital demonstrated atrial flutter with variable conduction . she was in sinus tachycardia here with right bundle branch block and continued st segment elevation with qs in 3 and avf . she was admitted to the coronary care unit where she continued to have intermittent marked bradycardia with junctional rhythm and relatively low blood pressures and runs of flow ventricular tachycardia . she became increasingly disoriented . she developed first degree av block and then wenckebach block . the chest films showed mild cephalization . she became very drowsy with sedation when she developed some agitation and required intubation . she went to the cardiac catheterization laboratory because of low cardiac output and shock . she had ventricular pacing and the cardiac output came up to 2.3 . catheter study then revealed right coronary occlusion with no significant left sided disease . the right coronary artery had a large burden of intravascular thrombus and she was eventually able to have the clot cleared and a near 2.5 stent was placed with good result . she had timi 2 to 3 flow in the right coronary artery after stenting and removal of clot from the right coronary artery . she continued to have intermittent runs of ventricular tachycardia . she remained intubated but her hemodynamics improved somewhat . dobutamine was diminished because of the wide complex tachycardia and she developed atrial fibrillation . she was initially tried on intravenous pronestyl in an attempt to restore sinus rhythm . she was later switched to amiodarone but there continued to be no effect on her atrial fibrillation . eventually her lines were able to be withdrawn and she was moved to the floor . she had a lot of wheezing and in late january she had continued elevated wedge pressure and her creatinine started to rise to 3.2 and then 4 with nonoliguric renal failure . she was then returned to the unit where she underwent further monitoring . the bun rose to 91 . her digoxin level was 1.9 on february 6 . she was able eventually to be extubated and moved back to the floor . efforts to mobilize her began in early january and an echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 49% . the right ventricular function was normal . after extubation she developed a considerable amount of upper respiratory stridor which was treated initially with decadron . the patient was seen in consultation by ent consultants who found that she had some hardened inspissated secretions in the region of the vocal cords , glottic inlet and subglottis . there was no structural abnormality . moistened oxygen and mucomyst was given with eventual restoration of her voice and diminution in her stridor . she continued a rather slow improvement . the patient was seen in consultation by drs. morning and morning because of the abnormalities of renal function . the possibility of renal artery stenosis was raised and she eventually was able to have a mri . she had some hematuria and was seen by dr. ryna jescdrig . renal and bladder ultrasounds were normal . she had abnormal urinary cytology however and dr. jescdrig strongly recommended that this be followed up by cystoscopy when she is able to do that . that can take place either here at his office or in aersing rocuch sun or when she returns to carfachemoses hospital . because of alternating and fluctuating mental status , she had a head ct scan which showed small area of intracranial bleeding . this was followed up and was shown to resolve . mr angiogram revealed no evidence of renal artery stenosis . a mri of the head because of the small area of bleeding was done to look for amyloid angiopathy which would have made anticoagulation dangerous . she was then begun on coumadin when none was found and is now being transferred to rehabilitation in hopes of her eventual return to her home with her sister on carfachemoses hospital . shasqualena r. im , m.d. tr : wqf dd : 02/21/1998 td : 02/22/1998 8:41 a cc : shasqualena

{"id": 65, "label": "unknown", "text": "principal diagnosis : 1) right lower extremity pseudomonas cellulitis . 2) paroxysmal atrial fibrillation . 3) cord compression . 4) steroid induced diabetes mellitus . 5) plasmacytoma . 6) poor nutritional status . 7) thrombocytopenia status post bone marrow transplant . 8) multiple myeloma . history of present illness : this is a 59-year-old white male . the patient has had multiple myeloma since 1990 . he underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant in 10/92 at petersly hospital and medical center . at that time he received total body irradiation of 1400 cgy . this bone marrow transplant did not produce remission and then he was treated with three cycles of vad subsequently . in 08/94 , the patient developed lower back pain . a workup done in de is not available at the time of this dictation . according to her scanty records , an mri of the spine showed diffuse spinal column involvement with lesions in t4 and t8 with no cord compression at that time . he was then treated with radiation therapy from t3 to t9 receiving 2500 cgy from 08/94 to 09/94 . he has been on decadron since 08/94 . about two weeks prior to admission the patient developed mid back pain , burning in nature with radiation around the right lower ribs . he also began to develop noticeably increasing bilateral lower extremity weakness and possibly numbness in the lower extremities . he stated that he had difficulty rising from a chair . an mri without gadolinium done on 11/20/94 of the spine showed a right posterior lateral epidural mass extending from t9 to t12 . there was evidence of cord compression . the patient 's decadron dose was increased to 12 mg q day and he was also started on ms contin and radiation therapy was being planned and arranged at the petersly hospital and medical center . however , one day prior to admission the patient developed right lower extremity pain and could not walk secondary to the pain . over the next 12 hours while in transit to the hospital , the patient 's right lower extremity became red , swollen , and increasingly painful . he has had chronic bilateral lower extremity swelling since his transplant but the right lower extremity swelling was noticeably increased . he also complained of some fecal incontinence the day prior to admission without urinary incontinence . at the time of presentation the patient denied headache , arm weakness , changes in vision , dysarthria , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , chest pain or shortness of breath . he was taken to huyychestleme health of in scoo , utah where he had a temperature of 99.9 , blood pressure 90/50 , heart rate 128 , and o2 sat of 91% on room air . blood cultures , urine culture , and ua were all done . blood cultures drawn on admission subsequently grew pseudomonas aeruginosa . he was treated with ceftazidime , gentamicin , and vancomycin and also was started on a dopamine drip for treatment of his sepsis . a swan was placed and initial readings were cvp of 6 , wedge pressure of 10 to 12 , cardiac index of 4.7 , and svr of 438 all consistent with a pseudomonas sepsis picture . he was given stress steroids and was subsequently transferred to lorough medical center 's intensive care unit for further management . past medical history : 1) multiple myeloma . 2) paroxysmal atrial fibrillation . 3) plasmacytoma of t9 through t12 . 4) chronic renal insufficiency . 5) chronically low platelet count . 6) failed autologous bone marrow transplant in 10/92 . 7) hypothyroidism . family history : positive for diabetes mellitus . social history : married to a very supportive wife . allergies : question of penicillin and sulfa drugs leading to a rash . medications : on transfer include vancomycin , ceftazidime , gentamicin , solu cortef 100 mg q8h , lasix , synthroid , insulin , ms contin 60 mg b.i.d. , mso4 2 mg p.r.n. pain iv , dopamine 12 mcg per minute . physical examination : on admission showed a non-toxic appearing male with temperature 99.5 , blood pressure 82/50 , heart rate 118 , respiratory rate 15 . heent exam atraumatic , no oral lesions . neck supple , carotids without bruits . cardiac exam was regular s1 and s2 , no murmur . chest clear to auscultation with a few fine crackles at the left base . abdomen non-distended , positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender , no hepatosplenomegaly or masses . rectal normal tone , guaiac positive brown stool , no perirectal lesions or erythema . extremities reveal the right lower extremity was tense , purple-red , swollen , and was warm from the knee to the ankle and extremely tender . there was pitting edema of both lower extremities but no evidence of cellulitis of the left lower extremity . neurological exam on admission revealed he was drowsy but easily arousable to voice , oriented to person , retelk county medical center , and date , able to say no but mildly inattentive during examination . cranial nerves intact . motor exam normal tone , positive asterixis , no drift . strength was decreased in both lower extremities . coordination was normal with good finger to nose , gait was not tested . deep tendon reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities , 1+ in the patella reflexes , no reflexes at the ankles , upgoing babinski toes bilaterally . laboratory data : on admission revealed white blood cell count 4.2 , hct 27 , platelet count 28 . glucose 191 . pt 17.6 , ptt 48.7 , fibrinogen 686 , tt 39.2 . magnesium 1.7 . ua showed no white blood cells , positive granular casts . chest x-ray was without infiltrates , wand in good position . an mri was performed upon admission and showed an epidural mass at the right posterior lateral t9 to t12 area invading the neural foramina . there was no csf density . these findings were consistent with the cord compression . hospital course : by problems - 1) infectious disease / cellulitis : the patient 's clinical situation was most consistent with a pseudomonas cellulitis and subsequent sepsis . blood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out pseudomonas that was sensitive to imipenem and tobramycin . there were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at retelk county medical center and those also grew out pseudomonas aeruginosa . the organism grown at this institution was sensitive to imipenem , ceftazidime , amikacin , gentamicin , ciprofloxacin , tobramycin but was resistant to cefotetan , ceftriaxone , mezlocillin , bactrim , ampicillin , chloramphenicol , and sulbactam . he was treated initially with ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism 's susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital . he was subsequently switched to imipenem and tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course . the tobramycin and imipenem were started on 11/25/94 . in addition , the patient received a five day course of intravenous igg to improve infection control . vancomycin was also added to his regimen on 11/28/94 and this was primarily to provide improved mrsa coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral right lower extremity . he was evaluated by the surgery department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time . he is being maintained with twice daily xeroform with betadine changes . these dressing changes are applied by applying the xeroform on betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages . of note , the patient has extreme pain with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for pain control during dressing changes . the plan is to complete a full course of imipenem and tobramycin for his pseudomonas cellulitis . as mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh . the cause of this erythema is not know at this time but has not shown extensive progression . 2) cardiovascular : the patient was initially treated with dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved . he was noted to be in rapid af on several episodes receiving 5 mg iv lopressor each time with improvement . he has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm . an echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital while he was septic showed decreased global ef . the patient is being maintained on digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation . he has had no significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization . the plan is to continue the digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection fraction when he is clinically better . 3) oncology : the patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine . he has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay . the plan is to complete a full course of xrt to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma . the patient 's lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied , however , the mri appearance does not seem to be infectious and is most consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy . 4) neurologic : as mentioned above he has a cord compression and is on steroids . he was initially treated with iv decadron 10 mg up front and then 6 mg q6h. his neurological exam remained stable with no evidence of increasing lower extremity edema . his decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg iv q6h on 12/3/94 . his decadron dose will be slowly titrated down over time following his neurological exam closely . 5) blood sugars : the patient has steroid induced diabetes mellitus . he has been on increasing doses of insulin receiving nph in the morning and night in addition to a czi sliding scale on a q6h basis . the plan is to continue the supplemental insulin while he is on steroids and while his sugars remain high . 6) respiratory : he initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90% . however , with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his o2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93% . he can be given intravenous lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema . 7) nutrition : the patient has a poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia . he has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued . he should also be encouraged to eat as much as possible orally in addition to this tube feeds and aspiration precaution should be maintained . 8) elevated pt and ptt : both of these responded to three day course of vitamin k 10 mg each day . his pt and ptt are now normal , however , he continues to run a low platelet count . this has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant . we have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20,000 to reduce his bleeding risk . he also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his hct around 30 . thrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient . disposition :

of about 5.8 . she was seen by the nephrology service and it was deemed quite likely that the acute and chronic renal insufficiency that had progressed causing this admission was related to her myeloma kidney . in the weeks prior to admission she had just begun thalidomide orally as a salvage treatment for her myeloma . she tolerated without sedation but probably was not at a therapeutic dose and it had had no impact by the time of her admission . the patient , her son randdor so and i had several long conversations about the potential for further renal deterioration and need for hemodialysis . the family and the patient felt quite clearly that hemodialysis was not indicated if the underlying myeloma was not controllable . they did agree , however to one more attempt at pulse decadron therapy with consists of oral decadron forty mgs po q.day ( in divided doses ) for four consecutive days followed by four days off , followed by four days on , etc. for a total of eight sessions of four days of decadron on . by the time she had left she had completed only the first of the four consecutive days as expected her blood sugars went up into high 300's or 400s and she needed sliding scale regular insulin in addition to standing doses of nph . on the days when she was not on decadron the standing doses of nph were sometimes suspended because her blood sugars would get to 41 and she would have remarkably few symptoms in this setting , perhaps related to the low dose beta blockers that she also takes . there had been a slight down turn in her creatinine by discharge to 4.7 but there was concern that she could not tolerate any greater hydration rates due to crackles in her bases although her jugular venous pressure went about six and she was never symptomatic with fluid overload . potassium did not appear to be a problem throughout the rest of her hospitalization . she was also seen by the pain service who was baffled by the cause for her lower extremity leg pain that has been present for several years , not progressive , minimally responsive to narcotics and currently on a second trial of neurontin of dubious value and would probably by the first medicine that i discontinue if she was feeling too sleepy or weak . the problem may be a combination of degenerative joint disease with spinal stenosis as well as neuropathic changes from diabetes +/- her myeloma . the patient also requested to be do not resuscitate , do not intubate and this was also in agreement with her son so . the patient is transferred to a skilled nursing facility to continue the pulses of decadron under close monitoring for blood sugars insulin regulation and to see that her potassium does not worsen and that perhaps her creatinine will improve a slight bit more , although probably not come back to normal . she will finish her last planned pulse of decadron by about november 25 , 2003 at which point depending on her creatinine and her status we may or may not elect further such treatments . medications on discharge : 1. heparin 5000 units subq b.i.d. 2. clonazepam 0.5 mgs po q.h.s. 3. risperidone 3 mgs po q.h.s. 4. regular insulin on a sliding scale as detailed in discharge medication orders , but essentially no insulin for blood sugars less than 200 but from 201 to 250 give four units subq , 251 to 300 give six units subq , from 301 to 350 give eight units subq , from 351 to 400 give ten units subq , and if over 400 give twelve units subq. she also has standing doses of insulin nph ten in the morning , ten in the evening and tentatively these will only be used during the days of high decadron and perhaps should not be used on the days without decadron . 5. metoprolol titrate 12.5 mgs po b.i.d. 6. calcium acetate ( phos-lo ) 667 mgs po t.i.d. 7. trazodone 25 mics po q.h.s. 8. neurontin 100 mics po q.h.s. 9. dilaudid 1-2 mgs po q6h prn for leg pain . 10. colace 100 mgs po t.i.d. 11. senna two tablets po b.i.d. 12.

complicated in that the left anterior descending had poor re-flow and two stents needed to be placed , as there was a second lesion in the mid left anterior descending . the distal vessel was quite diseased and poor with regard to vessel quality and caliber . a good result was obtained with a stent in the proximal left anterior descending and a stent in the mid left anterior descending and the patient went to the intensive care unit on a balloon pump , intubated . his peak cpk was in the 3000 range . the patient developed hemoptysis while intubated and on integrelin and heparin . he underwent bronchoscopy , which showed no specific lesion . in addition , chest ct showed no obvious reason for his hemoptysis , with the exception of atelectasis . it was felt that perhaps the patient had atelectasis and perhaps some aspiration , which predisposed him to hemoptysis . in addition , the patient had confusion and delirium . head ct was without any obvious intracranial catastrophe . he was seen in consultation by the neurology and psychiatry services and felt to have cognitive deficits and was ultimately controlled and managed with a combination of seroquel and haldol . in addition , the patient had a sitter during parts of his hospital course to keep him oriented . the patient had a return to the cardiac catheterization lab on 2/2/02 to receive a stent to the tight circumflex . this was uneventful , without the need for intubation , etc , and the procedure went smoothly . he tolerated it well . the ostial right coronary was a relatively small vessel for the patient and was not approached this admission . the patient was transferred to evinlandcalco hospital . he had difficulties with urinary incontinence and required straight catheterization for post-void residuals up until the time of this dictation . he was still having 300 cc or so post-void remaining in his bladder . he is followed by dr. squithsherl in this regard . at the time of this dictation , the plan is for probable transfer to a rehabilitation facility for physical therapy . he has had no recurrent heart angina pectoris or heart failure . of note , cardiac echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction in the 40% range with apical akinesis . electronically signed riethern n breun , m.d. 02/17/2002 11:29 _____________________________ riethern n breun , m.d. tr : fb dd : 02/06/2002 td :

the cranial nerve exam : pupils reactive to light , extra ocular movements show good upgaze up to 3 mm. , good down gaze . right lateral gaze , the right eye had 2 mm. of sclera showing , the left eye was normal , and there are a few beats of right beading nystagmus . the left lateral gaze , the left eye had 1 mm. of lateral sclera showing . disks were flat . sensory limb of the right eye corneal reflex is slowed , otherwise normal . seventh nerve weakness on the right in a central pattern is present . soft palate was in the midline and moved upward nicely , but did not respond to gag . tongue protrudes 2 cm. with slight deviation to the right . sensory exam was not remarkable , cerebellar exam was not possible . motor exam showed greater than 4+ strength bilateral upper extremities and psoas unable to lift off bed . quadraceps 2+ on the left and 3+ on the right . gastroc. 3 on the left and 4+ on the right . tibialis 3 on the left , 5+ on the right . reflexes were diffuse 3+ , toes upgoing bilaterally . laboratory data : on admission , electrocardiogram showed less than 1 mm. of st depression in v4 to v6 , which is likely the patient 's baseline . ck 's were mildly elevated but the mb fractions were not remarkable . a chest x-ray showed some left lower lobe atelectasis . admitting creatinine was .7 , glucose 131 , white blood count was 10,000 , hematocrit was 40 , liver enzymes normal range . hospital course : the patient was taken to the intensive care unit after her angiogram . she was aggressively anticoagulated with heparin . a small intimal tear in the arch of the aorta during the angiogram , was without sequelae . she was doing well with at least 4+ strength in all of her extremities , when on 11/13 , she had an acute drop in her systolic blood pressure to 70 for unclear reasons and without evidence of acute sepsis . this was accompanied by substantial decrement in neurologic function . for a short time , she seemed \" locked in \" . she has made slow progress since then and at the time of discharge has 4-strength at the left elbow and 4+ in the left wrist and hand . trace movement of the right elbow and 4-strength of the right wrist and hand . 4-to 4+ strength at the left ankle , 4+ strength at the right knee and right ankle . she is unable to lift either foot off the bed . the extra ocular movements are full . tongue protrudes 4 cm . she

therapy and physical therapy closely and should continue to show improvement . she is anticoagulated on coumadin and this has been stable . she is do not resuscitate in agreement with the wishes of her multiple family members . follow up computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown infarction in bilateral basis pontis , mid brain , the superior cerebellar areas , left thalamus , bilateral temporal lobes medially and inferiorly and left posterior communicating artery . the patient had fevers sporadically during this hospitalization with rising white blood counts . a chest x-ray documented a progressing left lower lobe infiltrate . initially this improved on clindamycin and cefotetan , but fevers recurred on this antibiotic regimen . sputum grew out klebsiella pneumoniae , and she was treated with gentamicin and ancef for 14 days intravenous ( bug being sensitive to these two drugs ) . a left pleural effusion developed and this was tapped with ultrasound guidance , and found to be sterile , and without evidence of empyema . the patient is on ciprofloxacin . the day of discharge is day #3 of 7 , after which antibiotics should be totally discontinued . she has developed bad thrush in this setting , she is not yet able to swallow and so she is on nystatin swish and spit five times a day . she also gets peridex to clean out her mouth . once her liver enzymes are completely normal , a seven day course of fluconazol may be helpful if the thrush is not spontaneously resolving off of antibiotics . she has been afebrile for greater than 10 days , including several days on oral antibiotics . the patient 's liver enzymes were noted to be elevated mid way through her hospital course , to about three times normal , especially the sgot and sgpt . these have spontaneously reversed , and are nearly normal at the time of discharge . a right upper quadrant ultrasound documented gallstones , without evidence of common bile duct dilatation or active cholecystitis . the exact cause of her liver enzyme elevation is unclear , but we are being careful about administering drugs , which might irritate the liver . the patient had a steady decline in her hematocrit during this hospitalization . iron studies are all entirely normal , her anemia is attributed to anemia or chronic disease with hypoproliferation as well as multiple phlebotomies . the plan is to give her folic acid , but not iron . the patient 's potassiums have been repeatedly low and require daily checks and repletion . this is thought due to the extensive course of gentamicin which she received . this must be carefully checked despite the standing order for potassium . the patient has had low sodiums during this hospitalization . this may due to her central nervous system process or her pulmonary process , with fluids administered as described , she should not have any problems from this . her sodiums were never below 130 . she does well with tube feeds . her tube feeds orders are as follow : full strength replete with fiber at 70 cc. per hour . in addition , the patient gets 250 cc. of juice ( not water ) three times a day . she also gets lactinex granules three packages in each bottle of tube feeds . she also gets metamucil one teaspoon with the first bolus of juice each day . please note that evaluation by the swallowing therapist , showed that the patient is aspirating at this time , but there is great hope from the nature of her deficit and the good movements of her tongue that normal swallowing should return soon . it is for this reason that she is discharged with an nasogastric tube and that no plans for g tube placement are made at this time . she has a history of of angina without myocardial infarction that has not been worked up . she did have brief chest pain twice during this admission that did not correlate with electrocardiogram changes . in the first week of november , her electrocardiogram showed t wave inversions in the lateral leads , correlating with an increase in the ldh , but not ck . this did not normalize with administration of isordil and the patient denied chest pain at this time . as of 4/7 , her electrocardiogram had reverted back to normal and there is no evidence of congestive heart failure or continued electrocardiogram changes , and chest pain is absent . her cholesterol was 350 here . she has been off of her hypercholesterol medicines . these can be restarted when it is deemed reasonable , in view of her acute disease and recently elevated liver enzymes . note that the liver enzymes were normal on admission , at which time she was taking all of the above cholesterol medicines . medications on discharge : metamucil 1 teaspoon q.d. , with first bolus of juice , juice 250
