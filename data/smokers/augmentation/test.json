telemetry for greater than 48 hours which demonstrated no dysrhythmia during this time . the patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction with left ventricular hypertrophy and no significant valvular abnormalities . the patient was maintained on her aspirin and lasix . the patient 's diltiazem was stopped due to her increased blood pressure and was started on labetalol which was gradually titrated up to a target blood pressure of 160-170 systolic in her right arm . the patient also underwent an adenosine mibi stress test which showed only mild lateral ischemia . at this time , the patient 's presyncopal symptoms were not felt to be secondary to a cardiovascular etiology . 2 ) neurological / vascular : the discrepancy in the patient 's pulses and blood pressure was felt to be consistent with a subclavian artery stenosis . the patient underwent mri / mra of the head , neck and upper chest which demonstrated a proximal left subclavian artery stenosis , proximal to the take off of the left vertebral artery . the left vertebral artery had a decreased flow consistent with either native vessel disease or some degree of retrograde flow with subclavian steal phenomenon . the patient had patent carotids bilaterally on her neck mra . mri of the head demonstrated a small vessel disease and was likely an old right cerebellar infarct . the patient underwent non-invasive carotid ultrasounds which demonstrated no significant carotid disease . the patient was also noted to have antegrade flow in both of her vertebral arteries bilaterally . the results of these studies suggested that the patient 's symptoms were not due to subclavian steal phenomenon , and therefore , it was decided that the patient would not go further to angio and / or surgical or percutaneous intervention . a neurology consult was obtained and it was felt that the most valuable intervention that could be done for the patient 's intervascular disease would be adequate control of her blood pressure . 3 ) orthopedic : the patient suffered a fall at home with her initial event . outside hip films were obtained , but were not available for view . repeat hip films demonstrated a right sided pubic rami fracture , likely new . an orthopedics consult was obtained and the patient was encouraged to weight bear as tolerated with physical therapy assistance . a bone scan was also obtained to rule out an occult hip fracture which was negative . at the time of this dictation , the patient was able to bear weight with the assistance of physical therapy and a walker . plans were made for the patient to be discharged to dwardmegriff rehabilitation for rehabilitation of her rami fracture . 4 ) gastrointestinal : the patient had an episode of her described vertigo while lying in bed and on the monitor during which no dysrhythmia was noted . the patient also complained of frequent vomiting at least once a day , occasionally associated with ingestion of her medications , but sometimes associated with ambulation . the patient has a long-standing history of spontaneous emesis due to overwhelming stress or excitement . however , the patient reports emesis in the hospital more frequently . the patient 's emesis was noted to be bilious without evidence of new or old blood . the etiology of the patient 's nausea remained unclear as she demonstrated ability to keep down many of her meals which did not suggest an anatomical lesion of her gastrointestinal tract . the patient was started on meclizine on december 31 , 2000 for her nausea and vertigo . an attempt was also made to reduce the patient 's large number of medications and the patient 's os-cal , multivitamin , lasix and colace were discontinued . 5 ) infectious disease : the patient complained of some urinary incontinence and difficulty initiating urine on december 30 , 2000 . urinalysis demonstrated a likely urinary tract infection . the patient was started on levofloxacin 250

: the patient was admitted to the floor with variable changes in his ekg . he became pain free in the emergency room and was initially admitted to evinlandcalco hospital . however , he developed recurrent chest discomfort on the floor with worsening of his anterior st segments with elevation , and he was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory . in the cardiac catheterization laboratory , right heart catheterization showed ra 7 , rv 36/9 , wedge 16 . he was treated with integrelin in addition to his intravenous heparin , aspirin , and nitrates . he was found to have the left anterior descending occluded proximally with right to left collaterals . the circumflex was codominant with severe 90% lesion proximally in the circumflex and 50% lesion in a large om . the right coronary artery was codominant and had an ostial stenosis in the 70% range . left ventriculography revealed an akinetic anterolateral wall . a balloon pump was placed and right heart catheterization was performed showing the above . the patient developed worsening st elevation on the monitor and the decision was made to go ahead and open the left anterior descending . the procedure was reasonably complicated in that the left anterior descending had poor re-flow and two stents needed to be placed , as there was a second lesion in the mid left anterior descending . the distal vessel was quite diseased and poor with regard to vessel quality and caliber . a good result was obtained with a stent in the proximal left anterior descending and a stent in the mid left anterior descending and the patient went to the intensive care unit on a balloon pump , intubated . his peak cpk was in the 3000 range . the patient developed hemoptysis while intubated and on integrelin and heparin . he underwent bronchoscopy , which showed no specific lesion . in addition , chest ct showed no obvious reason for his hemoptysis , with the exception of atelectasis . it was felt that perhaps the patient had atelectasis and perhaps some aspiration , which predisposed him to hemoptysis . in addition , the patient had confusion and delirium . head ct was without any obvious intracranial catastrophe . he was seen in consultation by the neurology and psychiatry services and felt to have cognitive deficits and was ultimately controlled and managed with a combination of seroquel and haldol . in addition , the patient had a sitter during parts of his hospital course to keep him oriented . the patient had a return to the cardiac catheterization lab on 2/2/02 to receive a stent to the tight circumflex . this was uneventful , without the need for intubation , etc , and the procedure went smoothly . he tolerated it well . the ostial right coronary was a relatively small vessel for the patient and was not approached this admission . the patient was transferred to evinlandcalco hospital . he had difficulties with urinary incontinence and required straight catheterization for post-void residuals up until the time of this dictation . he was still having 300 cc or so post-void remaining in his bladder . he is followed by dr. squithsherl in this regard . at the time of this dictation , the plan is

principal procedure : 6/13/94 : intra-aortic balloon placement . 6/17/94 : intubation . hemodialysis . history of present illness : this is a 56-year-old man with a history of ischemic disease transferred to the fih for further care for cardiogenic shock . mr. given had an anterior myocardial infarction in 1981 . he had inferior myocardial infarction in february 1992 . his course was complicated at that time by hypertension and an echocardiogram showed an lv ejection fraction of 0.10 to 0.15 . in august , 1993 he had an out of hospital cardiac arrest . he rule in for another myocardial infarction at that time . he was transferred to the fih where he underwent a work up of both his arrhythmia and his heart failure . an automatic implantable defibrillator was placed . he was thought to be a good candidate for a transplant at that time as coronary arteriography showed diffuse disease in the lad and right coronary arteries as well as a proximal circumflex stenosis . because of the diffuse nature of the disease and the left ventricular dysfunction , mr. given was thought not to be a revascularization candidate and was listed for a transplant . mr. given waited as an outpatient for the availability of a donor heart . he was admitted to the hospital in late april with multiple episodes of bloody diarrhea . colonoscopy demonstrated severe crohn 's disease with sparing of the rectum . a perirectal fistula was seen . treatment with iv corticosteroids led to improvement and mr. given was discharged from the hospital ten days ago . on the evening of april 22nd , mr. given developed progressively worsening dyspnea . he presented to the iming medical center emergency room on the morning of april 22nd with hypertension and dyspnea . he was given intravenous fluid to support his blood pressure and developed pulmonary edema and was intubated . hypertension continued and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed . he is now being transferred to the fih for further treatment . physical examination : physical examination on transfer was remarkable for a blood pressure of 80/56 and a heart rate of 124 . his cvp was 16 . he was on the balloon pump at the time . his chest was clear anteriorly . his cardiac exam was remarkable for a summation gallop . no murmur was auscultated but the high heart rate did diminish the possibility of this . his abdomen was soft and he had no extremity edema . his feet were cool but there were pedal pulses bilaterally . laboratory data : admission laboratory studies included a hematocrit of 34.3 and a white count of 25,700 . the sodium was 126 , the bun 80 and a creatinine of 4.6 . electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia with an intraventricular conduction defect . there were inferior q waves consistent with an old infarct . the chest x-ray revealed mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly . hospital course : mr. given was admitted to the hospital and it was hoped that his end organ dysfunction would improve with a period of ballooning and improved perfusion such as to allow transplantation to eventually take place . he was maintained on levophed as a vasopressor as well as dopamine and dobutamine . it was noted that his intra-aortic balloon pump was only a 30 ml pump , and on the day after admission , mr. given was taken to the catheterization laboratory where this was exchanged for a 40 ml pump . after replacement of the intra-aortic balloon pump , mr. given remained critically ill , although there was some improvement in his augmented diastolic pressure . he did develop atrial fibrillation , however , which led to hemodynamic decompensation with a wedge pressure of 32 and a cardiac index of 1.6 . it was hoped that with continued inotropic support this would improve . he also remained intubated . mr. given was seen by dr. farstshuff of the gi service for advice regarding his crohn 's disease . all of these issues , including his acute renal failure , were thought to be contraindications to transplantation . as mr. given did not have any bowel sounds , he did have to remain on nasogastric suction . he was seen in consultation by dr. needs of the renal unit . dr. needs felt that the patient had had ischemic acute tubular necrosis and that we could continue to administer diuretics in a an effort to take off volume , but that we did have to allow time to pass in order to see improvement . procainamide was begun in an effort to convert mr. given to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation . initially he was in and out of sinus rhythm , but paroxysmal atrial fibrillation did occur frequently . as mr. given 's renal function did not improve , he was begun on continuous venovenous hemodialysis . this resulted in a reasonable clearance of creatinine . he was able to get some fluid off as well . with getting some volume off , the patient 's ventilation improved , as did many of his other metabolic parameters . his cardiac index had also improved with this to 2.7 , although he was on dobutamine as well . on 6/19 an effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump . with a decrease in the counterpulsation ration , he developed atrial flutter with a fall in blood pressure and cardiac index . the balloon pump was restored . he was continued on this as well as on dobutamine and amrinone support . he continued on hemodialysis , but had little urine output . supportive care continued . unfortunately , the white blood count began rising , raising the possibility of sepsis . broad spectrum antibiotics to cover potential sources in the gastrointestinal tract were begun and ciprofloxacin was added . mr. given 's blood pressure appeared to stabilize . another effort was made on 6/22 to attempt to wean the balloon , but this led to an increase in his wedge pressure and a fall in his arterial pressure , and this was stopped and he was restored to full counterpulsation . he had been able to be transiently extubated after dialysis had reduced his lung water , but he had to be reintubated on 6/24 . hemodialysis continued with maintenance of reasonable metabolic parameters . he did develop worsening metabolic acidosis . his hemodialysis was adjusted in an effort to resolve this . he continued on vancomycin , ciprofloxacin , zosyn , and fluconazole antibiotics . another effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump on 6/26 . this resulted in a fall in his cardiac index , but his blood pressure and wedge pressure were stable . he did have runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia . on 6/29 mr. given began developing periods of hypotension . the patient stated that he did not want to be reintubated , as it became quite clear that he would not be a transplant candidate . he began having multiple runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia . the patient and his significant friend , incloztaua , had a long discussion with his physicians and they felt that , given the futility of his situation , supportive care should be ended . indicative of this , mr. given took his oxygen mask and demanded that it not be replaced . he developed progressive hypotension and was pronounced dead

{"id": 16, "label": 0, "text": "principal diagnosis : metastatic melanoma . principal procedure : wide resection of metastatic melanoma to the right shoulder with partial thickness skin graft reconstruction on 9/1/00 . history of present illness : this is a 69 year old man who was initially diagnosed with a right upper posterior extremity melanoma level 4 , 2.5 mm in depth , in 10/02/92 . subsequently in 10/92 he underwent a wide excision with axillary dissection which showed residual malignant melanoma with nine negative lymph nodes . he had a recurrence in 05/99 in a similar area which was 2.1 mm in thickness . he had this resected between 8/4 and 9/5/97 and was treated with 6000 c of radiation therapy over the right upper extremity . he has done well since that time and subsequently in 05/98 had pulmonary nodules which were noted and a computer tomogram scan in 08/98 demonstrated a 4.2 cm splenic lesion . he underwent an open splenectomy in the fall 1998 which demonstrated metastatic melanoma only to the spleen . since that time he has been treated with _______ cells in 1999 and also with allovecting injection to the right anterior axillary nodule . most recently in he has this right anterior axillary metastatic melanoma resected at brook hospital by dr. bainpruess on with local triceps myocutaneous tissue transfer . since april through july this area has increased in size where the triceps tissue transfer has been replaced with a bulky metastatic melanoma disease . surgical consultation for resection of this for local ___ control was requested . the patient has ___ dr. peakekudz and has known visceral metastases of the liver as well the lung with mediastinal adenopathy which has been stable for the past two years . the other complicating factor in his care was that he was wheelchair bound from a viral meningeal encephalomyelitis in 1966 and has relied heavily on his upper extremity for wheelchair transfer and access and transportation . in order to workup up this metastatic melanoma recurrent after local excision only two months previously it was elected to get an magnetic resonance imaging scan of the shoulder . this magnetic resonance imaging scan confirmed that there was a large mass which measured approximately 4-6cm anterior to the deltopectoral groove and unfortunately a smaller lesion 1cm was seen separately adjacent and medial to the biceps tendon near the brachial neurovascular bundle . an magnetic resonance imaging scan which was performed three months prior to admission to brook hospital for resection demonstrated that this more medial lesion was not present at that time and therefore it was suspicious for metastatic melanoma . the patient had a fine needle aspiration of this bulky tumor mass which demonstrated malignant melanoma and subsequently he was sent for a positron emission tomography scan which was performed at s nakantlakeing university hospital and medical center on 8/24/00 . the positron emission tomography scan demonstrated a known larger anterior metastatic melanoma and more medially two approximately 1cm lesions that also enhanced . these were consistent with metastatic

adverse drug reactions : none . clinical infections : none . history of present illness : mr. warm is an 83 year old man with chronic congestive heart failure , mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis who was admitted for diagnostic cardiac catheterization . over the last four to five months , mr. warm has noted a marked decline in functional capacity with nearly daily pnd and orthopnea . he has not experienced recent syncope but did have a syncopal episode in 1 resulting in implantation of a defibrillator . although in the past , he has been somewhat ambivalent with respect to cardiac surgery , given the decline in his functional capacity , he agreed to undergo repeat cardiac catheterization with a view towards defining his candidacy for cardiac surgery . the patient lives independently with his wife in connecticut and continues to be less and less active unfortunately . he has nearly curtailed his trips to a gymnasium for cardiopulmonary exercising . he does not drink alcohol and does not smoke cigarettes . physical examination on admission : on examination , the patient was an extraordinarily pleasant man who appeared his stated age . his blood pressure was 110/70 . heart was 82 and regular . respiratory rate was 16 . his jugular venous pressure was not elevated and his carotids were 2+ . lungs were notable for adequate air movement with no rales . the first and second heart sounds were physiologically split and the cardiac impulse was rather diffuse and inferiorly displaced . there was an s3 gallop at the apex and a 2/6 murmur of mitral regurgitation at the apex which radiated to the axilla . the abdomen was soft and nontender . there was no organomegaly but modest hepatojugular reflex . the extremities were without edema and were warm and well perfused . the posterior tibialis pulses were intact . laboratory data : sodium 140 , potassium 5.0 , bun 45 , creatinine 1.9 , glucose 90 . albumin 3.6 , hematocrit 41 , white count 8.6 , platelets 388 and pt 12.6 seconds . the chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly and no significant congestion . the ecg was paced . an outpatient echocardiogram revealed a left atrium of 45 mms. , an lv of 60 mms. , ejection fraction of 26% , moderate to severe mitral regurgitation by color and spectral doppler , aortic stenosis with a valve area of .8 cms. squared with a peak gradient of 50 , a mean gradient of 30 , an ejection fraction of 26% with diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis and more severe inferior hypokinesis . there was mild tricuspid insufficiency , an estimated rv peak systolic pressure of 55 and a mild diffuse hypokinesis of the right ventricle . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the hospital following uncomplicated cardiac catheterization that revealed a right atrial pressure of 5 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 23 , pulmonary artery pressure of 56/22 with a mean of 36 , a cardiac output of 6.1 liters per minute with a cardiac index of 3.8 liters per minute per meter squared . the aortic valve gradient was approximately 32 mms of mercury peak with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 cms. squared . coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the dominant right coronary artery in the proximal segment with distal reconstitution via left to right collaterals . left ventriculography revealed a dilated , diffusely and severe hypokinetic left ventricle with the anterior basilar wall best perfused and an ejection fraction of 18% . there was 3+ mitral regurgitation and reflux into the pulmonary veins in the ------ views . in addition , there was a 60% lesion in the left circumflex artery and only minimal irregularities in the left anterior descending itself . the patient tolerated the procedure well apart from a small rise in his creatinine to 2.3 which returned to his baseline value of approximately 1.7 to 1.9 at the time of discharge after holding his diuretics and his vasodilator medications . the patient was seen in consultation by dr. win shufffyfe of the cardiac surgery service and after a long discussion with the patient , dr. shufffyfe and the patient 's family , it was decided to defer cardiac surgery likely indefinitely and probably permanently given the patient 's age , co-morbidities , lack of probable benefit with relief of his mitral regurgitation , modest aortic stenosis and relatively modest coronary artery disease . while in hospital , the patient was seen by lenni breutzoln who felt that the incremental benefit from biventricular pacing was likely to be modest . the patient also underwent a sleep study which revealed evidence for fairly advanced and severe obstructive sleep apnea with multiple hypopneas and apneas , mean duration of which was approximately 30 seconds with one episodes of 68 seconds with a desaturation to 71% . the patient was fitted with a cpap apparatus with titration of 8-12 cms. of water as tolerated as an outpatient . in addition , the patient had oxygen therapy given his prominent desaturation at night . at the time of discharge , the patient 's vasodilator regimen had been winnowed appreciably and he was discharged with a goal weight of 125 lbs . he will be followed both by

{"id": 27, "label": 1, "text": "principal diagnosis : ruptured parathyroid adenoma . history of present illness : ms. shuffa is a 73-year-old portuguese speaking woman who was transferred via med flight to verg medical center . she arrived intubated and was hemodynamically stable despite concerns of a dissecting aortic arch aneurysm . she initially presented to brottlake medical center on 9/15/00 complaining of acute onset dysphasia to liquids and solids . while she was in brottlake medical center , she developed new onset stridor , and an ent consult was obtained . they attempted a fiberoptic intubation with a # 6 endotracheal tube and found a 5 mm severely compressed airway . she was also found to have a differential systolic blood pressure and ecchymosis on her anterior chest . given these findings , she underwent a ct scan which showed a retrotracheal mass that appeared to obliterate the esophagus . this raised concerns for a hemorrhage , and she was transferred to verg medical center emergently . at the ingree and ot of weamanshy medical center , she underwent an emergent ct scan with iv contrast . this revealed no extravasation of contrast and no aortic aneurysm . however , it did show an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with a density consistent with a hematoma . she was admitted to the thoracic surgery service under the care of dr. sccrookes . past medical history : severe hypertension , angina , gerd , peptic ulcer disease , status post billroth ii , ovarian cancer , status post tah-bso in 1987 with a negative second look laparotomy in 1988 , chronic anemia , chronic left ear infection . medications prior to admission : celexa 10 mg p.o. q.d.; lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.; capoten 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.; pepcid 20 mg p.o. q.d.; cardizem 180 mg p.o. q.d.; xanax 0.5 mg tabs . on transfer , she was on her preadmission medications plus unasyn and tigan 250 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. allergies : no known drug allergies . social history : she is divorced and retired . she lives with her daughter , and denies any tobacco or alcohol use . physical examination : the patient is intubated . vital signs : temperature 98.6 , 66 . right arm was 180/80 , left 188/72 , and a-line was 151/61 . tidal volume is 700 with a rate of 10 , 10 of pressure support , and 10 of peep , and 100% fio2 , satting 100% . general : she was sedated and spontaneously moving all four extremities . neck : edematous . trachea was midline . she had bilateral crepitus in the anterior neck . the superior clavicular area showed no signs of central line access attempts . she had a 3 cm mobile gelatinous well-circumscribed mass in the right supraclavicular region . her anterior neck and chest had a 1 cm to 2 cm area of ecchymosis . lungs : she had bilateral expiratory wheezes . abdomen : soft with good bowel sounds . it was nontender . it was obese with a large midline defect consistent with a ventral hernia , as well as a smaller anterior defect in the left lower quadrant . both were easily reducible . pulse : on the right side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , dp , pt , and radial ; on the left side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , dp , pt , and radial . laboratory data : cbc was 8.7 , 25.3 , and 184 . coags 12.2 , 24.8 , and 1.0 . her gas was 7.47/40/332 . electrolytes were 143 , 3.4 , 105 , 28 , 24 , 3 , and 131 . ekg showed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and incomplete left bundle branch block . ct scan showed an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with air . it was consistent with a hematoma . hospital course : ms. shuffa underwent an egd and flexible bronchoscopy on 9/16/00 shortly after she arrived . this showed tracheal compressions but no other lesions that were obvious at the time . she was hemodynamically stable and remained on the ventilator . the differential diagnoses at this point consisted of hematoma vs. neoplasm vs. an abscess vs. a thyroid tumor . on 9/22/00 , she underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy . a biopsy of this mass was consistent with hematoma . the operative report shows that there was an abnormal area below the trachea to the left which represented a cavity between the esophagus , trachea , aorta , and spine that was full of clot . there was no active bleeding at the time . over the next several days , the patient remained hemodynamically stable on the ventilator . she had an elevated calcium level that raised the suspicion that this mass could be a hematoma coming from a ruptured parathyroid adenoma . the ionized calcium was elevated as was the parathormone level . given these findings , she underwent a sestamibi scan . the sestamibi scan showed findings that were consistent with a parathyroid adenoma in the right lobe of the thyroid . at this time , it was believed that her clot was due to a rupture of this parathyroid adenoma . dr. ear brought the patient to the operating room on 10/5/00 . she underwent a parathyroid exploration with resection of a ruptured ectopic right upper parathyroid adenoma , a biopsy of a normal left and right lower parathyroids , resection of a left upper parathyroid , and tracheostomy . she tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the surgical intensive care unit with her new tracheostomy working well . her postoperative course was complicated by serosanguineous pleural effusion on the left . this required a chest tube . her hematocrit continued to drop over the next couple of days despite normal platelet count , normal coags , and no obvious source of bleeding . it was believed that she was continuing to bleed in her chest . however , we are not quite sure why this was occurring . she underwent an extensive workup by hematology that revealed a bleeding diatheses of unknown etiology . it turns out that several people in her family have a similar bleeding diathesis of unknown etiology . in conclusion , by systems : 1. neuro . the patient became intermittently agitated . we have been giving her haldol at bedtime as well as ativan p.r.n. throughout the day . she responds well to this . she speaks some english and seems to understand more than she speaks . she has a family member who is present for approximately 12 hours each day . she has been very helpful in translating and seems to say that ms. shuffa is in good spirits . 2. cardiac . the patient 's blood pressure has been ranging from approximately 140 to 160 systolic . this is on a current regimen of lopressor 25 mg per ng tube t.i.d. as well as diltiazem 60 mg per ng tube t.i.d. , and lisinopril 10 mg per ng tube q.d. she occasionally gets hypertensive when she is agitated . for this , we have given her 10 mg of hydralazine . her blood pressure responds well to this . otherwise , she is in normal sinus rhythm and has been hemodynamically stable throughout her hospitalization . the patient developed a left femoral artery pseudoaneurysm after placement of a greenfield filter . this has been followed by the vascular surgery service here at the ingree and ot of weamanshy medical center . dr. lenni lung has been consulted . the aneurysm at the time of discharge is approximately 2.5 cm . they elected not to inject it with thrombin . they asked that the patient follow-up with dr. ear in approximately three to four weeks so that this aneurysm can be assessed . they have opted for conservative management given the size . 3. respiratory . at the time of discharge , the patient remained on cpap with a peep of 7.5 and a pressure support of 9 . she seems to be tolerating this well as she has an o2 sat of 100% on 40% fio2 . her chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe hematoma that had greatly improved in the last few days . her right lung field is clear . her tracheostomy is functioning well , and we have had no problems with it . she will obviously need to be weaned as tolerated . we had her down to a low pressure support of 7 in the last week . with the pressure support at 7 , she became tachypneic and had to be brought back up to 10 . her oxygen saturation has always been good . 4. gi . the patient is getting tube feeds via her ng tube of full strength jevity of 75 cc per hour . this is her goal . she tolerates them very well and has approximately 200 cc to 300 cc of stool per day . last week , she had copious amounts of stool in the range of 500 cc to 1000 cc of liquid stool per day . stool cultures have been sent numerous times as well as analysis for c. difficile toxin . these have all been negative . we believe the this was an osmotic diarrhea . since her tube feeds have been changed from full strength nephro to jevity , her diarrhea has resolved . she has been taking zantac , and the ph of her ng tube residuals have been in the 5 to 8 range . 5. gu . the patient has had hypernatremia . she is approximately 10 kg up her overall body weight . we believe her to still be total body overloaded . over the last several days , we have been giving her approximately 500 cc to 1000 cc of free water through her ng tube . we also have been diuresing her with bumex . this seems to trend her sodium down . this will need to be monitored closely . her bun and creatinine have been normal , and she has always made good urine . 6. heme . as stated before , the patient continued to ooze into her pleural space well after her definitive operation . she had an extensive workup by hematology which revealed a bleeding diathesis of unknown origin . before we removed her chest tube , we had to give her platelets . she had no problems with this . at the time of discharge , her hematocrit is stable in the 28 to 33 range . i stress that she cannot be anticoagulated . we have given her lovenox in the past , and she continues to bleed . therefore , she is on no dvt prophylaxis . she does have a left iliac deep vein thrombosis . she has a greenfield filter in place , and this is her only dvt prophylaxis . 7. id . at the time of discharge , the patient has a urinary tract infection . she is growing enterobacter cloacae that is sensitive only to macrodantin from her urine cultures . interestingly enough , she also has enterobacter cloacae growing out of her sputum . this is also sensitive only to macrodantin . we do not believe that she has any respiratory process going on at the time . she is just begun on macrodantin at the day of discharge and

medications on discharge : metoprolol 50 mg po bid , isordil 20 mg po tid , enteric coated aspirin 1 po qd . history of present illness : the patient is a 65 year old portuguese male with a history of an anterior myocardial infarction i may 1993 and is status post a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the lad who presented on 10-24-93 with crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath . he had no prior cardiac history until may 1993 when on 5-24 he had crushing chest pain which radiated to his left arm . he was found at that time to have 3-4 mm st segment elevations in v1 through v4 at pre health . the patient was transferred to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital and had 4-7 mm st segment elevations across the precordium with q's in v1 and v2 , 2 mm st elevation in avl , and 1-2 mm reciprocal st depression in ii , iii , and f. on physical examination at that time he had bright red blood per rectum and therefore lysis was deferred and he was taken directly to the cardiac catheterization lab . the cardiac catheterization results at that time revealed a right atrial pressure of 7 , pulmonary artery pressure of 29/16 , rv 33/8 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 . he had a 95% proximal left anterior descending lesion which was ptca 'd to a residual of 30% and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed . he also had some mild to moderate disease at the om1 noted at that time . the patient was transferred to the cardiac care unit where he had a peak cpk of 5,042 and 26.7% mb's . his intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned without problems . he had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started . on day six , an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 44% with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis . on day nine , he had a low level exercise tolerance test with thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in ii , iii , and avf , and 1.5 mm downsloping st depressions in v5 and v6 , as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on thallium . therefore , he went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal pda lesion and a circumflex lesion after the om . the patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with dr. shuffburle of gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with dr. amesin of cardiology and dr. shuffpasc of dingclearf alllirefaith memorial hospital . however , he did not keep any of these appointments . he went home and did not take any of his medications and smoked and drank heavily throughout the several months . on the a.m. of 10-24-93 , the patient developed crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath . he came to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital emergency ward where he was noted to be ashen and diaphoretic . he was treated with oxygen , aspirin , five sublingual nitroglycerins , heparin , and was eventually made pain free with that regimen . cardiac risk factors : his cardiac risk factors included hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , cigarette smoking , and a positive family history . past medical history : his past medical history included hypertension and non-insulin diabetes mellitus which is diet controlled . past surgical history : his past surgical history had included gastric ulcer surgery and appendectomy . medications on admission : on admission , he was on isordil 10 tid and enteric coated aspirin , but he was not taking either of these medications . habits : the patient smokes one pack per day and has a history of heavy alcohol use . physical examination : the physical examination on admission revealed a blood pressure of 110/70 , a heart rate of 66 , respirations of 24 , temperature of 98 . the heent exam revealed the extra ocular movements intact . the pupils equal , round , reactive to light . the oropharynx was clear and the fundi were normal . there were no hypertensive or diabetic changes . the neck was suppled , with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention . the carotids were 1+ without bruits . the heart was regular rate and rhythm , s4 , s1 , s2 , with a i / vi systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border . the lungs were clear , except for a few dry crackles bibasilarly . the abdomen revealed a midline scar and a right lower quadrant scar , and it was soft and nontender wit positive bowel sounds . the liver edge was 2 cm below the right costal margin , but smooth and nontender . there was no splenomegaly . the femoral pulses were diminished . he had bilateral intertrigo in his femoral region as well as his axillae . the extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema . the pulses were 1+ bilaterally . the skin exam revealed changes consistent with vitiligo . the rectal examination was guaiac negative . laboratory data : the laboratory data revealed normal electrolytes , bun and creatinine , normal liver function tests , a first cpk of 140 , and a hematocrit of 43.1 . the portable chest x-ray showed clear lungs , slight enlarged heart , and a mildly elevated hemidiaphragm . the electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 81 , with normal intervals and normal axis , had poor r-wave progression consistent with an old anterior myocardial infarction , had flipped t-waves in v1 through v5 , which were of no significant change since his last ekg on 5-25-93 . hospital course : the patient was admitted to the step down unit for a rule out mi protocol . he was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin . no beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110/70 . the patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak cpk of 219 and 20.9% mb fraction . this was a non-q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes . on 10-27-93 , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been ptca 'd , a lesion in the first om , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the om3 . the left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle . given the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the ptca , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient . he was ambulated progressively on the floor . a beta blocker was started with metoprolol initially at 25 mg po bid and eventually increased to 50 mg po bid . the patient ambulated extensively on the fih 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath . on 11-2-93 , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with thallium imaging . this treadmill test was done on medications , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment . the patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified bruce protocol , however , he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade . there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm st depression in ii , iii , and avf . the study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain . thallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle . there was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test . these images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous thallium images in may 1993 . after extensive discussion between myself , dr. amesin , and dr. scgach , it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management . the patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although he understands that this may become necessary in the future . dr. amesin had a long discussion with the patient 's daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient 's compliance . previously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments . the importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient . she will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with dr. amesin as well as dr. lfsquarc on the outside . the patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization . despite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done . he will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future . caghala uinteele , m.d. tr : yf / bmot dd : 11-3-93 td : 11/04/93 cc : dr. telshey swatlleebtik dr. eri lfsquarc "}

gunshot wound many years ago and has had multiple surgical procedures since then . most recently he was admitted to an outside hospital with a drug overdose in adult respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately found to have candidal pericarditis which eventually led to constrictive pericarditis . he had a pericardial window . he had a barium swallow and endoscopy and was said not to have gastric or pericardial ulcer . he had previous substernal gastric bypass because of an interruption of his esophagus at the time of his gunshot wound . he had been noted to have an ulcer and ultimately when he stabilized it was our feeling that he most likely had a gastric pericardial ulcer and he was transferred here for further management . we discussed the risks with his family . it was a very high risk in very poor condition and a cachectic malnourished edematous individuals who have very high venous pressures and shortness of breath . the family understood that this was a life saving procedure and only carried with it approximately 50% chance of success . special procedures and operations : esophagoscopy , bronchoscopy , pericardectomy , excision of gastric ulcer , repair of gastric ulcer and pectoralis major myocutaneous flap performed on december 4 , 1995 by dr. reg cranka and dr. win shufffyfe . in lieu of a standard discharge summary given this patient 's complicated hospital course and associated illnesses i feel it best to just provide a system summary concerning this patient 's current status . 1. neurologic and psychologic : the patient is on nortriptyline for depression . he is a paraplegic from t4 down . otherwise he is awake , alert and appropriate and can respond to questions and can move his upper extremities . the patient however spends most of his time at bedrest due to decubiti ulcer disease . 2. cardiac : the patient had constrictive pericarditis that was relieved by his surgical procedure . he had a cardiac catheterization on december 1 , 1995 that showed no complications , elevated right atrial pressure and moderate pulmonary hypertension . the cardiac output was five liters per minute with an index at 2.9 liters per minute per meter 2 which is normal . a full copy of the cardiac catheterization report is enclosed with his transfer materials . the patient also underwent cardiac ultrasound on december 11 , 1995 that showed abnormal right ventricle wall motion , trace mitral regurgitation , normal left ventricular size and function with an estimated ejection fraction of 64% . there is doppler evidence of tricuspid insufficiency and right atrial dilatation . there is trace pulmonary insufficiency . the right ventricle is dilated and diffusely hypokinetic and there is no evidence of constrictive physiology which was seen on december 6 , 1995 . a copy of this ultrasound is also found in his records . the patient is on no specific medications for his cardiac condition . 3. respiratory : the patient is status post thoracotomy and has staples and sutures on his chest . these may be removed when the incisions are noted to be well healed . the patient is approximately three weeks following his procedure and several of these stitches will be removed prior to discharge . the patient is on oxygen by face mask and his saturations have been remaining normal . his medications for his respiratory system are albuterol nebulizer 0.5 mg. 2.5 cc. q4hours . 3. gi : the patient has had gastric ulcer repair and also has a colostomy . the patient has a sinus tract that was studied with a fistulogram on december 25 , 1995 . this showed no communication with the intestines and was simply a sinus tract . there is no fistula seen . dr. asha vengloan of general surgery consulted on the patient and concluded the patient does not require any surgical treatment of this problem at the current time and the best treatment for this situation would be to increase the patient 's nutrition . the patient takes poorly his po. diet . however he is able to swallow and tolerate po's . he just claims to have no appetite and has very poor effort with feeding . the patient is able to tolerate po. medicines . 4. gu : the patient has an ulcer on his penis that has been treated with dressing changes . it has been noted to be improving . the patient has a foley catheter in and when the penile skin is very well healed his foley catheter may be removed . until this time he should be kept on three times daily wet to dry dressing changes . 5. skin : the patient has multiple decubiti over his body , in particular his perineum and buttocks have large decubiti . plastic surgery was consulted dr. ca shuff who saw the patient and decided that the patient is not a surgical candidate at this point . these wounds should be treated with three times daily wet to dry dressings . the patient 's activity should be limited to being up in a chair only for several minutes per day and sit on a special pad that the family has purchased . 6. infectious disease : the patient 's white count at the time of discharge is within normal limits . the patient remains on fluconazole . his other antibiotics were discontinued . his most recent cultures are negative . the chest x-ray shows no evidence of pneumonia . 7. pain . the patient has been very closely with the pain service here while admitted . he has been placed on oxycodone 10 mg. po. q3hours as needed for pain . the patient had a pca and several other medications have been discontinued . the patient has strong narcotic seeking behavior . the patient for sleep was given benadryl 25 to 50 mg. qhs. and was not allowed any increases in his narcotics after weaning him down to just requiring the oxycodone . a complete summary of the patient 's medications are as

{"id": 56, "label": 0, "text": "discharge diagnosis : metastatic cervical carcinoma . secondary diagnoses include pericardial effusion , pulmonary lymphangitic spread , and liver and spleen metastases . operations and procedures : echocardiogram times two . history of present illness : patient is a 28 year old gravida iv , para 2 with metastatic cervical cancer admitted with a question of malignant pericardial effusion . patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy in 02/90 for a 4x3.6x2 cm cervical mass felt to be a fibroid at vanor . pathology revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix with spots of vaginal margins and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the cardinal ligaments with extensive lymphatic invasion . patient was felt to have stage 2b disease and post-operatively , she was treated with intracavitary and external beam radiation therapy and low dose cisplatin . on ultrasound in 02/91 , the patient was found to have bilateral cystic adnexal masses confirmed on physical examination . she underwent exploratory laparotomy and had a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy . pathology was negative for tumor and showed peritubal and periovarian adhesions . the patient now presents with a three to four week history of shortness of breath and a dry non-productive cough . she was evaluated by dr. mielke , a pulmonologist , who found her to be wheezing and performed pulmonary function tests which showed an fev1 of 1.1 and an fvc of 1.8 . she was admitted to weekscook university medical center with a diagnosis of possible asthma . room air arterial blood gas showed a po2 of 56 , a pco2 of 35 , and a ph of 7.52 . ekg showed sinus tachycardia at 100 and echo revealed pericardial effusion , a 10 mm pulsus paradoxus was noted , and no evidence of tamponade . given the patient 's history of cervical cancer , the pericardial effusion was felt most likely to be malignant . she was therefore transferred to the retelk county medical center for further care . past medical history : as above . past surgical history : 02/90 , total abdominal hysterectomy complicated by ureteral transection with right ureteral tube placed for six weeks , stent tube placed in left ureter six weeks prior to admission for a hydronephrosis post , in 03/91 , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy . current medications : prednisone 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. with 10 mg p.o. q.p.m. , uniphyl 400 mg p.o. q.d. , augmentin 250 p.o. t.i.d. , estrase 2 mg p.o. q.d. , ms contin 30 mg q.12h. , and morphine p.r.n. physical examination : emaciated white female in mild respiratory distress . temperature was 98.1 , heart rate 116 , blood pressure 120/68 , and room air o2 saturation was 93% . heent : dry mucous membranes and myotic pupils . neck : no lymphadenopathy . chest : few inspiratory wheezes and no rhonchi . heart : regular rate and rhythm with tachycardia and no rubs or murmur . abdomen : well healed pfannenstiel scars and no masses . pelvic : no masses . rectal : no masses and guaiac negative . extremities : no edema or cyanosis . laboratory examination : hematocrit was 40 , white count was 21 , and platelet count of 723,000 . pt and ptt were 12 and 26 . electrolytes were within normal limits , liver function tests within normal limits , and ekg showed a heart rate of 128 , axis 73 , and possible ectopic p . hospital course : the patient was admitted for a new pericardial effusion which was felt most likely to be secondary to metastatic cervical cancer . there was no evidence of tamponade . an echocardiogram was scheduled and cardiology was consulted . echocardiogram showed moderate anterior pericardial effusion of approximately 600 cc with diastolic indications of the right ventricle and low velocity paradox . cardiology did not feel that tamponade at this time was a concern and that a tap need not be performed . she continued to have pulmonary wheezing , unknown origin , without history of asthma . her steroids were tapered and pulmonary was consulted who recommended a ct scan of the chest to evaluate the lung parenchyma , induce sputum for cbc , arterial blood gas , continuing of the beta agonist inhalers , and trial of steroid inhalers . they felt it was most likely a malignant lymphangitic spread with pericardial involvement versus infectious , other cardiovascular causes , or viral bronchiolitis . she had pulmonary function tests repeated which showed an fev1 of 36% of predicted and fvc of 56% of predicted . room air arterial blood gas showed a ph of 7.45 , po2 of 63 , a pco2 of 41 , and fairly significant aa gradient . she was continued on two liters of oxygen awaiting her ct scan on 06/14 and she developed a new junctional rhythm with a question of a new rub versus murmur on examination . cardiology felt she had a rub and her pulsus was still 10 . ekg showed an ectopic low atrial p and they thought she was still stable without evidence of tamponade . she should have a follow-up echocardiogram . echocardiogram showed left ventricle at the upper limits of normal for size , low normal function , moderate to mild effusion with pericardial pressures exceeding right atrial pressures , and right ventricular pressures at various points of patient 's cycle without any change in the effusion from 06/11 . thoracic surgery was also consulted and they felt that there was no need for a pericardial window at the time . she should be continued with pulmonary oximetry testing . she underwent her ct scan . this showed lymphangitic spread of cancer in the chest , question of pulmonary nodules in the chest , pericardial effusion , multiple liver metastases , decreased function of the left kidney , dilated left intrarenal collecting system and proximal ureter , and periaortic lymphadenopathy . pulmonary felt this was consistent also with lymphangitic spread and they did not feel that a bronchoscopy would be of any assistance at this time . chemotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer was discussed with the patient and she was started on 5-fu 800 mg per meter squared days 06/18 , 06/19 , and 06/20 . she also received cisplatin 35 per meter squared on 06/19 and ifex and mesna on 06/18 . she was noted , on 06/16 , to have numerous erythematous maculopapules on her back and chest . dermatology was consulted and they felt that this was most likely steroid acne . they therefore felt a rapid steroid taper was indicated and topical erythromycin if desired by the patient . the patient 's shortness of breath and wheezing continued but without change . her cardiac examination remained the same and there continued to be no evidence of tamponade . cardiology felt that follow-up echo was indicated on 06/18 as she had another echocardiogram which showed no change or evidence of tamponade . they therefore felt that she could be continued to be followed by examination . she had some mental status changes with confusion and hallucinations on 06/18 originating from narcotics versus decreased po2 . the ifex was held as it was felt that it could have precipitated the mental status changes and that she was to receive no further ifex . she had no further hallucinations since stopping the ifex . psychiatry was also consulted to help her with the changes she was feeling since her new diagnosis . she was hooked up with support services in collot ln , dugo , indiana 68961 for further counselling and given xanax for symptoms of anxiety . she continued to have no change in her shortness of breath or cardiac examination and was discharged home on 06/22/91 after completing her 5-fu and cisplatin chemotherapy . disposition : she will be followed by dr. mielke and home care services . discharge medications : premarin 0.625 q.d. ,

small cell carcinoma . recently , he has complained of pain radiating down the left leg and work up had shown absent left knee jerk . plain films of the lumbosacral spine showed some scoliosis with blastic changes around l3 . the bone marrow biopsy was positive for metastatic carcinoma . the patient was admitted for further evaluation . physical examination : on physical examination on admission , the blood pressure was 164/90 , pulse 88 , respirations 20 . past medical history : note : past medical history included hypertension , treated by cardizem . the patient also has a history of degenerative joint disease . he had an episode of chest pain but ruled out for myocardial infarction . on physical examination , vital signs were as above . the head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was within normal limits , neck was supple , lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion . the abdomen was benign with no masses felt . cardiovascular exam : grade i / vi systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border , single s1 , s2 . the rectal examination showed guaiac negative stool . extremities : within normal limits . the neurological examination showed an absent left knee jerk . cerebellar function was normal . laboratory data : significant for a sodium of 140 , potassium 3.9 , chloride 105 , bun and creatinine 21 and 1.5 , ldh 732 , sgot 84 , alkaline phosphatase 145 , bilirubin 0.3 , calcium 10 , albumen 4.1 , globulin 3.9 , white blood count 8.9 , hematocrit 43.3 , 62 polys , 26 lymphs , 9 monos , 1 eo , 2 basos , prothrombin time 9.8/10.0 , partial thromboplastin time 31.8 . during this admission , an upper gastrointestinal and small bowel follow-through on 9-5-93 was normal . a computerized tomography scan of the chest showed diffuse esophageal wall thickening , dilatation of the esophagus with air fluid levels and no evidence of mediastinitis and some air space disease in a medial segment of the right middle lobe . bone scan showed multiple regions of abnormally increased activity in the dorsal spine and lumbar vertebrae , as well as a right anterior fourth rib , consistent with metastases . a magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain showed no definite evidence of metastatic deposits . there was microvascular disease . a computerized tomography scan of the abdomen showed multiple low density lesions within the liver , consistent with metastatic disease and a 1.5 centimeter low thoracic paraesophageal lymph node , pathological . spleen , pancreas and kidneys were within normal limits . a magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain showed no metastases . the magnetic resonance imaging study of the spine showed extensive bony metastases . there was no evidence of spinal cord compression on magnetic resonance imaging study , though there was evidence of pressure on the l4 nerve root . hospital course : the patient was admitted and he was started on chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the l4 spine region . the first course of chemotherapy was given from 8-19-93 through 8-21-93 . this was vp-16 150 mg daily x three and cisplatin 60 mg daily x three with zofran 11 mg on three occasions as an antiemetic and each dose of cisplatin was preceded by 12.5 grams of decadron . the chemotherapy was well tolerated but did result in febrile neutropenia . granulocyte colony stimulating factor was added . thus white blood count dropped to 0.6 minimum on 8-27 , with platelet count of 63,000 but with granulocyte colony stimulating factor support and antibiotics for febrile neutropenia , white blood count recovered . actually the lowest white blood count was 0.5 on 8-31-93 . on that occasion , platelet count was as low as 17,000 . by 9-8-93 , the white blood count was back up to 16.2 . the patient 's course was complicated by severe pain and intractable nausea and vomiting and severe substernal pain . he is on ms contin and also on duragesic patch . he continued to have nausea and vomiting . the patient was seen in consultation by dr. signs of gastroenterology . eventually , a picc line was inserted and he was given central total parenteral nutrition because of severe anorexia during radiation therapy . two weeks passed without a bowel movement because of the lack of intake and eventually that resolved . it was felt that endoscopy would be of value . a central venous line was placed on 8-29-93 . after neutropenia resolved by 9-2-93 with white blood count rising to 2.2 and platelet count to 28,000 , endoscopy became feasible . this was done on 9-4-93 and there were inflammatory exudates , ulcerations , and granulation tissue in the middle and distal third of the esophagus , but the tumor polypoid masses had completely disappeared . cytologic brushings of the ulcerated areas were positive for cancer cells but deep biopsies were negative . the patient was treated with fluconazole in case there was any monilia , although biopsy did not confirm the presence of monilia . gradually during the hospitalization , the sternal pain improved , as did the pain in the left hip and the patient became able to ambulate somewhat . he was making progress and accordingly , a second course of chemotherapy was given at lower dose . he received vp-16 100 mg daily x three , 9-12 , 9-13 and 9-14-93 , and cisplatin 40 mg daily x three on that same date with zofran 10 mg. the only problem was some recurrent nausea . the radiation therapy was finally finished on the day of discharge , 9-19-93 , at which point the patient was able to take fluids and food but was still occasionally vomiting . his white blood count was in the range of 53,000 because neupogen had been started with his second cycle of chemotherapy and will be continued until it is clear that he has passed the nadir of any neutropenia to be expected from this cycle of chemotherapy . discharge diagnosis : 1. metastatic small cell cancer of esophageal origin to liver and bone , 2. severe ulcerations of the esophagus at sites of prior tumor , 3. intractable nausea and vomiting , 4. pain syndrome , largely resolved , 5. hypertension . medications on discharge : prilosec 20 mg po

cardiovascular : the patient ruled out for mi by cardiac markers . the patient was set to go for a dobutamine stress test on 11/16/04 given her history of copd , but the stress portion was canceled when she was down there due to fever and hypotension . the next day , she underwent a cardiac echo ( transthoracic echocardiogram ) . this echo showed lv ejection fraction of 50% with no wall motion abnormality . however , the right ventricular was diffusely hypokinetic . it was suboptimally imaged , so there was no rvsp given . the patient also suffered a hypotensive episode while in the endoscopy suite for her egd on 11/17/04 . this responded to fluid bolus . the patient was then transferred to medicine team d given her tenuous hemodynamic status . the patient , several days later 11/23 , underwent another dobutamine stress test . this stress test , although complicated by hypotension again , to the 60 's or 70 's was completed and there was some mild anterior septal thinning , but no evidence of ischemia and an ef from this test was 76% . clearly , the patient 's hemodynamic vascular status was very sensitive to dobutamine . 2. infectious disease : on hospital day #2 , the patient was noted to have increased dyspnea on exertion . the next day she developed a fever and she was started on levofloxacin for a potential uti . she continued to have low-grade fevers and on the next day , 11/17/04 , her chest x-ray showed possible new right upper lobe infiltrates . she was then started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin . her urine legionella antigen was negative . on 11/22/04 , she was noted to have gram-positive cocci in her sputum . she was started on vancomycin for this . these bacteria turned out to be mrsa and she was continued on her vancomycin . she had picc line placed on the day prior to discharge for home vancomycin administration . 3. gi : the patient had an episode of nausea on the morning of 11/16/04 associated with some cough , apparent emesis . gi was consulted for an egd , however , while she was in the endoscopy suite , as mentioned above , she had a hypotensive episode , which responded to some fluid boluses . finally , on the day prior to discharge , she was stabilized to the point that she could have her egd . the egd did show three esophageal ulcers that were localized and apparent suggestion of pill esophagitis . her stomach and duodenum were normal and it was suggested that she change her nexium doses to daily and that she also drink plenty of fluids and water with meals , sit upright when she would eat her meals to decrease the chance of pills eroding her esophagus . 4. shortness of breath : as mentioned above , the patient did develop mrsa pneumonia that was started to be treated with vancomycin and she did also develop an oxygen requirement the day prior to discharge . at most , her oxygen requirement was 4-5 liters and on the day prior to discharge , she was satting well on two liters of nasal cannula . this was thought to be due to her pneumonia ; however , with her right ventricular hypokinesis , it is also possible that she may have an element of pulmonary hypertension and may warrant further investigation as an outpatient , for example , with chest ct . 5. derm : several days prior to discharge , the patient developed some erythematous rash under her left breast and left side that was thought to be due
